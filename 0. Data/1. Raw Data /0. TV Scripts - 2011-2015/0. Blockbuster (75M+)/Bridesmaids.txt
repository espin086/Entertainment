EXT. UPSCALE MODERN HOME - NIGHT
The ultimate bachelor pad.
it.

A Porsche is parked in front of

ANNIE (O.S.)
I’m so glad you called.
TED (O.S.)
I’m so glad you were free.
ANNIE (O.S.)
I love your eyes.
TED (O.S.)
Cup my balls.
ANNIE (O.S.)
Ok, yes, alright, I can do that.
TED (O.S.)
Oh, there it is!
INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
ANNIE WALKER, mid 30's, is having sweaty sex with TED,
handsome, 40. In a series of close-ups and jump cuts, we see
Annie in the middle of a very long, vigorous session.
ANNIE
Oh, that feels good.
TED
You know what to do!
ANNIE
I’m so glad I got to see you again.
JUMP CUT to see she’s now bouncing on top of him.
ANNIE (CONT’D)
Oh yes!
(then, looking concerned)
Uh, okay, wait, hold on. You and I
are on different rhythms I think.
TED
I want to go fast!

2.

Oh, Okay.

ANNIE
Sure--

He bounces Annie SUPER FAST.
INT. CLEAN, UPSCALE MODERN BATHROOM - MORNING
Annie stands in front of a mirror in nice lingerie. She puts
on lotion, make-up, brushes her hair, mascara, etc. She
getting ready to...
Creep back into the bed, where Ted is still sleeping. She
gets in and begins to position herself to show her good
parts. Coughs and nudges Ted to wake him up.
Annie quickly
pretends she’s still asleep. He taps her.
ANNIE
(gasps/ pretending)
Oh! I was having a nightmare, I was
so scared. Good Morning.
TED
Good morning. You look beautiful.
ANNIE
(acting embarrassed)
What? No. I’m sure I look
terrible. I just woke up. I’m sure
I’m a mess.
TED
You slept over.
I did.

ANNIE

TED
I thought we had a rule against
that.
...oh.

ANNIE

TED
I’m kidding.
ANNIE
Oh, that’s funny. You’re funny in
the morning.
TED
I like hanging out with you.

3.
ANNIE
I love hanging out with you. I
think we get along really well. And
you’re so sexy...
TED
I know. Look, I just have a lot
coming up at work. And I don’t want
to make promises I can’t keep.
ANNIE
We’re on the same page. I’m not
looking for a relationship right
now either, let’s just say that.
Whatever you want, I can do. I like
“simple”, I’m not like the other
girls who would be like “be my
boyfriend!” Unless you were like,
“yeah!”, then I’d be like “maybe”.
They hug tightly and he kisses her deeply.
go. Stares at her...

Then he lets her

TED
Wow, this is awkward. I really want
you to leave but I don’t know how
to say it without sounding like a
dick.

Oh.
Annie stares.

ANNIE
(speechless)
Awkward moment leading into ...

EXT. UPSCALE MODERN HOME DRIVEWAY- MORNING
Annie does the walk of shame out of the house. She attempts
to exit through the driveway gate but it won’t open. Tries
to pull it open to fit through the crack but can’t.
She sighs, then starts to climb over the gate. As she’s
straddling the top, it starts to OPEN. The HOUSEKEEPER in
her car with her clicker. Annie WAVES to her from the top of
the opening gate. Mortified.
Annie jumps down and runs to her car. A old neighbor
getting his paper, stares at this sad spectacle. His dog
stares too.

4.
EXT. PARK - DAY
A BOOT-CAMP workout session is going on, men and women are
painfully following along. The instructor is yelling angrily
at the class. WAY IN THE BACKGROUND we see two women peaking
out from behind a tree. It is Annie and her best friend,
LILLIAN, mid 30’s. They are taking his class without him
knowing.
LILLIAN
He scares me.
Me too.

ANNIE

LILLIAN
But he’s an excellent motivator.
ANNIE
That’s true. Oh shit, he sees us.
From the distance we hear the BOOT CAMP INSTRUCTOR yelling.
BOOT CAMP INSTRUCTOR
Hey! If you want to take this
class, you’re going to have to pay
for it like the rest of these
bitches!
Caught, Annie and Lillian pretend to randomly dance.
BOOT CAMP INSTRUCTOR (CONT’D)
Oh, dancing? In the park?! You are
not dancing in the park.
Freeloaders! I’m comin’ over there.
The women run off.

Lillian yells back.

LILLIAN
Sorry, Rodney, we’re on a budget!
INT. JONI’S RESTAURANT - DAY
Annie and Lillian continue laughing, as they sit in their
workout clothes, casually picking food off each other’s
plates as they talk.
ANNIE
I’m so glad we got to do this, I
feel like I haven’t seen you in
forever.

5.
LILLIAN
I know, I’ve been in Chicago a lot.
ANNIE
I know, sleeping at Dougie’s house.
LILLIAN
It’s just closer to work.
ANNIE
How’s it going with him anyway?
LILLIAN
I don’t know. It’s fine, but I feel
like he’s been a bit distant
lately. He calls me “dude” a lot.
ANNIE
That doesn’t mean anything. I think
everything’s fine.
LILLIAN
I don’t know. Anyway, what did you
do last night?
Umm...

ANNIE

LILLIAN
What did you do last night? You are
not telling me something.
ANNIE
I hung out with Ted for a little
bit.
I knew it!

LILLIAN

ANNIE
We had fun. It was fun.
LILLIAN
Here’s what I don’t like about it.
You hate yourself after you see
him, every time. And then we go
through this and you feel like
shit, and it’s almost like you’re
doing it because you feel bad about
yourself.

6.
ANNIE
He called me late and we hung out.
It wasn’t a big deal. And it was
fun.
LILLIAN
Ew, you had sex with him.
ANNIE
We had...an adult sleep over.
LILLIAN
Oh, did you let him sleep over IN
YOUR MOUTH? ...Annie!
ANNIE
I’m sorry. He kept putting it near
my face.
LILLIAN
They do that.
ANNIE
Let us offer. If we don’t offer-LILLIAN
You’re supposed to slap it away.
ANNIE
I couldn’t! You don’t want to look
right at it. It’s too aggressive.
It’s like...
Annie imitates a penis.
ANNIE (CONT’D)
That’s my impression.
Annie sticks out her elbows.
LILLIAN
Those are the balls?
ANNIE
I’m trying to make it round, but I
can’t cause I have elbows. He’s so
hot though!
LILLIAN
Look, I know you say he’s cute and
all that stuff, but it makes you
feel like shit. You’re a total
catch and any guy would be psyched
to be your man.
(MORE)

7.
LILLIAN (CONT'D)
You should just make room for
somebody who is nice to you.
ANNIE
You know what, he’s honest. He told
me we are what we are, and we’re
just having fun. And I like that!
LILLIAN
He also told you you need dental
work. He’s an asshole!
Annie has food covering a tooth.
ANNIE
I don’t need dental work.
LILLIAN
You’re right.
ANNIE
There’s nothing wrong with my
teeth.
Lillian has food on her teeth too.
LILLIAN
You’re so beautiful. Will you marry
me?
Yes.

ANNIE

LILLIAN
I love you.
ANNIE
I love you.
EXT. MILWAUKEE STREET - DAY
Annie and Lillian are walking in downtown Milwaukee.
LILLIAN
I don’t want to go to work today!
Lillian fishes in her purse for her phone and checks it.
LILLIAN (CONT’D)
Let’s see how many times Teri has
called me. Oh, only 15. Ya know
what Teri? I don’t want to pick up
your monkey lamps. Sorry.

8.
ANNIE
Monkey lamps?
LILLIAN
I cannot wait to never work for a
psychopath again.
Lillian notices Annie has stopped to stare at a CLOSED DOWN
BAKERY across the street. It's cool and unique, like the
CBGB's of baked goods. Some of the letters have been
removed, but we can see that it used to say “Cake Baby.”
Between the two words is a cool drawing of 1950’s RETRO PINUP style woman with a cake tucked under her arm.
LILLIAN (CONT’D)
I’m sorry. I should have gone down
Mason.
ANNIE
Well, I’m the genius that opened up
a bakery during a recession.
LILLIAN
They were good cakes Annie.
Thank you.

ANNIE

LILLIAN
Come on. Look away, look away.
INT. CHOLODECKI’S JEWELRY STORE - DAY
A family owned, outdated jewelry store in downtown Milwaukee.
Annie stands at a counter talking to an excited ASIAN COUPLE.
ANNIE
Do you have any ideas of what
style?
ASIAN WIFE
Oh, I don't know, what do you think
honey?
ASIAN HUSBAND
Whatever you want.
ANNIE
Look at how you guys are making
this decision together, that’s
sweet. You guys love each other
huh? Oh that’s sweet. That will go
away.

9.
ANGLE ON: Annie's boss, DON, is glaring at her from his desk,
horrified.
ANNIE (CONT’D)
You can not trust anybody. Ever.
Especially someone you’re in a
relationship with, you know? Cause
they’re living with ya. You don’t
know who you’re sleeping next to.
It is scary. I mean look at him, he
might not even be Asian. It’s
scary. So, did you guys want to
look at these engagement rings?
ASIAN HUSBAND
We’re gonna browse.
The couple turn and leave.
DON
What was that about?
ANNIE
(searching)
Nothing. They had to run. They had
to go somewhere.
DON
No wonder. You’re selling life long
happiness. You’re not telling
everyone your problems and how your
boyfriend left you and maybe
marriage will work out. Annie, when
you’re selling an engagement ring,
you have to represent lifelong
happiness. Show me your “love-iseternal” face.
Annie tries to make a pleasant face.
DON (CONT’D)
No, that’s two years. Four years,
tops. That’s not eternal. Kahlua,
come over here please.
KAHLUA, a very pretty African-American woman, walks over.
KAHLUA
Sup, Don-Don?
DON
You’re so good at nicknames. You
don’t need a nickname because
Kahlua is so delicious.
(MORE)

10.
DON (CONT'D)
Don’t sue me for touching you. Show
Annie your love-is-eternal face.
Kahlua beams in a sensual, ridiculous way. Don turns to
Annie, who is trying to mimic Kahlua’s face.
DON (CONT’D)
(to Annie) That looks like you have
menstrual cramps. Thank you so
much, Kahlua.
Kahlua smiles and leaves.
DON (CONT’D)
Why can’t you be more like Kahlua?
ANNIE
I’m trying really hard here.
DON
You’ve just got to try harder.
(stepping closer to Annie)
The whole reason you got this job
was because your mom was my sponsor
in AA and I’m doing her a favor.
ANNIE
I understand.
In the background, a SECURITY GUARD is lounging against the
displays behind the counter. Don turns to the guard before
leaving to a back office.
DON
Oscar, get back to work.
ANNIE
(to Oscar)
You shouldn’t be behind the
counter.
INT. ANNIE’S APARTMENT - DUSK
Annie walks into her crappy two bedroom apartment. A woman
in her 20’s, BRYNN, sits on the couch, watching TV.
ANNIE
Hey, Brynn.
BRYNN
Oh hey roomie. Guess what happened
to me today? I got a free tattoo.

11.
ANNIE
You did what?
BRYNN
I couldn’t believe it. The guy
said, ‘do you want a tattoo?’
ANNIE
Just a random guy?
BRYNN
Yeah, he opened up the side of his
van and said ‘it’s fo’ free!’ And I
said, ‘sure.’
ANNIE
You said yes?
BRYNN
Yeah! Look.
Brynn stands and lifts her shirt and
down to reveal an enormous tattoo of
that extends from her stomach around
back half is completely infected and
discharge leaking out.

pulls half of her pants
a giant Mexican worm
to her lower back. The
scabbed, with disgusting

ANNIE
Oh god, Brynn, it looks awful.
BRYNN
It’s a Mexican drinking worm. It’s
like a Native American symbol
meaning ‘wasted.’
GIL enters from the bedroom smiling.
sleeved dress shirt and tie.

He’s wearing a short-

GIL
(uncomfortably nice)
Annie!
ANNIE
Hi! Have you seen your sister’s
tattoo? It’s really infected.
GIL
Maybe we’ll get a bit of ice on it.
ANNIE
Yeah, maybe get some frozen peas on
there.

12.
GIL
Sure, can’t hurt.
Brynn moves to the kitchen to get ice.
GIL (CONT’D)
Um, just wanted a quick word. You
know that tomorrow the rent is due?
I was getting my check and I
wondered if I could get your check
too?
ANNIE
Yes, I’m getting the money. Its
been a little...
Behind Gil, Brynn has taken a bag of frozen peas out of the
freezer and openly pours them down her back. They clatter
onto the ground, going everywhere.
ANNIE (CONT’D)
(to Brynn)
You’re supposed to keep them in the
bag, put the bag on it.
Brynn gives her a thumbs up and goes back into the freezer.
GIL
So, the check?
Yes..

ANNIE

GIL
Because it’s kind of like, needingit-today type sort of situation.
Annie stares at the smiling Gil.

She doesn’t have the check.

ANNIE
Yes. Ok. It’s coming.
Annie escapes to her room. Gil turns and sees Brynn.
smiles warmly and chuckles.

He

CUT TO:
INT. LILLIAN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
DING DONG. An excited Lillian opens the door to reveal
Annie, posing with bottles of wine and a stack of magazines.

13.
ANNIE
Hurry up, let me in. Your creepy
neighbor invited me in to his place
to watch the news again.
LILLIAN
Ew. Let me help you with those.
Come in, let me take your
magazines. Welcome to the magazine
and wine party!!
Lillian excitedly takes the wine. Annie walks in confused by
this. Lillian is practically skipping.
LILLIAN (CONT’D)
Have a seat. I’m very happy you’re
here, because I want to eat an
apple. Would you like some apple?
Lillian splays her hand, showing off a sparkling DIAMOND
ENGAGEMENT RING.
ANNIE
(seeing ring)
Lillian... what is that?
LILLIAN
I got engaged.
ANNIE
What? WHAT?!
LILLIAN
He asked me last night! That’s why
he’s been acting so weird. I guess
he’s been planning it for like two
months and he’s not a good liar and
so if he felt like he was gonna
blow it, he would just stay away
from me.
ANNIE
(in shock)
Oh my god. Lillian...
LILLIAN
I know. I’m shocked, but I’m happy.
ANNIE
Oh my god. Oh my god, I just got
hot.
LILLIAN
Are you OK?

14.
ANNIE
My pits are sweating. My stomach
hurts. I don’t know, I’m hot. Oh my
god. Ah! What is happening?!
LILLIAN
I cant believe it.
ANNIE
Lill, you’re getting married.
Annie hugs Lillian tightly. Lillian hugs her back but it’s a
decidedly awkward moment as Annie hugs her way too long and
hard, like Lillian’s going off to war. They finally separate.
LILLIAN
So you’ll be my Maid of Honor...
ANNIE
Oh god, of course I will.
LILLIAN
We’ll have so much fun. We can plan
everything together.
ANNIE
...planning a wedding.
LILLIAN
Are you sure you’re up for it? I
know it’s a lot to ask and put on
on your plate. You’re going through
a tricky time, it’s a lot to ask...
ANNIE
Stop. It’s fine and I’m more than
happy to do it. It’s not too much.
Lillian’s cell phone rings.

She smiles.

LILLIAN
(goofing)
Can you hold that thought?
fiancee calling.
(they both laugh)
Hey, honey! Yeah, yeah.
ANNIE
(into the phone)
Yay!!

It’s my

15.
LILLIAN
I just told Annie. Yeah, she’s
excited! Yeah, um, let me check.
(then)
Annie, hold on, I’ll be right back.
I know baby, I miss you too.
Lillian makes a goofy face at Annie and they both laugh
joyously as Lillian runs out of the room. Annie is left
laughing too hard by herself, freaking out inside.
INT. ANNIE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Annie lays in bed looking at a photo of her and Lillian as
kids.
INT. WALKER HOUSE - DAY
Close-up of JUDY, Annie’s mom,
on a painting of Wynonna Judd.
Wow.

putting the finishing touches

ANNIE

JUDY
It’s Wynonna Judd. Painting those
giant bangs was a royal pain in my
can. And the teeth nearly killed
me. I should have painted her
mouth shut.
ANNIE
Mom, you should hurry up. We’re
gonna be late for the engagement
party.
JUDY
Oh. I forgot to tell you, I signed
up to speak at AA tonight. I have
to go, I forgot.
ANNIE
Mom! I keep telling you, you’re
not supposed to go to those things.
You’re not an alcoholic.
JUDY
Only cause I’ve never had a drink!
But they are inspiring. There is
this one amazing story I have to
tell you.
(MORE)

16.
JUDY (CONT'D)
This gentleman who started blow
jobbing to get crack. His name is
Marvin Johnson.
ANNIE
It’s supposed to be anonymous.
JUDY
OK, Marvin J., whatever. He turned
into a gay prostitute and he
realized he hit his bottom. Maybe
this is your bottom. But I’m
telling you, hitting bottom is
good. Cause it’s only up from
there. Positive message.
ANNIE
Thanks for the pep talk Mom.
JUDY
Oh honey, anytime.
ANNIE
Well, I guess I’m going to Lill’s
party all by myself.
JUDY
Oh honey, don’t talk to me about
being by yourself. I go everywhere
by myself. Thanks to that new
whore Barb.
ANNIE
Mom, come on. They’ve been married
twelve years.
JUDY
Ok, but she’s still a whore. I’m
sure she greets him in the evening
beaver first.
ANNIE
I don’t want to think about that.
JUDY
Are you sure you don’t want to move
in with me?
ANNIE
Thanks mom but no way. No way in
hell.

17.
JUDY
Think about it. You don’t need your
own place.
ANNIE
I kind of do. Alright, I’m gonna
go.
EXT. THE HUNT CLUB - CHICAGO SUBURB - DAY
Annie pulls up a tree-lined driveway of a BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY
CLUB. People entering in fancy clothes getting out of luxury
cars. Annie, surprised at how extravagant it all is. She
hands her keys to the valet, self-conscious about her car.
ANNIE
Sorry, it needs a wash.
The valet can’t get it started.
ANNIE (CONT’D)
You have to punch it a few times.
INT. HUNT CLUB - DAY
Annie’s eyes go wide as she walks into the elegant dining
room. FANCY. A lively cocktail party’s underway. Live
music. Happy upper-class people, dressed expensively.
Annie smooths her dress, self-conscious, then sees Lillian.
Annie!

LILLIAN

ANNIE
Oh my gosh Lillian, this is your
engagement party.
LILLIAN
Isn’t that crazy?
ANNIE
It’s so beautiful. I can’t believe
Dougie’s boss is a member here.
LILLIAN
I know, and his parents too. And
Dougie I guess. Oh gosh, and me I
guess too now. C’mon, let’s go say
hi to the rest of the bridal party.
They head over to RITA, 30’s, a voluptuous, tired housewife.

18.
LILLIAN (CONT’D)
Do you remember my cousin Rita?
Rita!

ANNIE

RITA
Annie! I haven’t seen you since you
graduated high school.
LILLIAN
She has three kids now.
RITA
Three boys.
So cute.

ANNIE

RITA
They are cute, but when they reach
that age they’re disgusting. They
smell, they’re sticky, they say
things that are horrible and there
is semen all over everything.
They’re disgusting. I cracked a
blanket in half. Do you get where
I’m going with that?
ANNIE
I do, yeah.
RITA
I cracked it in half.
BY THE PATIO BAR
LILLIAN
Annie, this is Becca. The one
from work. We’re in the trenches
together.
BECCA, 30, cute and perky.
husband KEVIN.

She stands very close to her

BECCA
Hi, Annie! This is my husband
Kevin. I love saying that. We’re
newlyweds.
ANNIE
Congratulations.

19.
BECCA
Thank you. We went on a sweetheart
honeymoon.
ANNIE
Where’d you guys go?
BECCA AND KEVIN
Disneyworld.
BECCA
We finish each others sentences.
They do a dumb, lovey gesture.
BECCA (CONT’D)
So, is this your husband?
Annie looks confused, then turns to see a BALD MAN with a
neck brace, late 40’s, standing behind her. He looks like a
strict math teacher.
ANNIE
No, I don’t know him, I’m sorry.
BALD MAN
Do you want to go for a walk later?
ANNIE
I can’t, sorry.
BECCA
I’m so sorry.
ANNIE
I’m not with anybody. I’m solo.
BECCA
I’m so sorry! Let’s start it again.
Rewind!

KEVIN

BECCA
I’m Becca. This is my husband. You
don’t have a husband. Sorry.
BY THE BANDSTAND
Annie and Lillian stand with MEGAN, 30’s, tomboyish, looking
a bit odd in her floral dress.

20.
LILLIAN
And this is Dougie's sister Megan.
(sees something)
Oh, wait, my grandma’s not supposed
to have wine. I’ll be right back.
Lillian rushes off.
ANNIE
How’s it going?
MEGAN
It’s going great. I'm on the mend.
Just got pins in my legs. Believe
it or not, I fell off a cruise
ship.
Oh shit!

ANNIE

MEGAN
Yeah, ‘oh shit.’ Took a hard,
violent fall. Kind of pin-balled
down, hit a lot of railings, broke
a lot of shit. I’m not gonna say I
survived, I’m gonna say I thrived.
I met a dolphin down there. I swear
to god that dolphin looked not at
me, but into my soul, into my
goddamn soul Annie, and said ‘I’m
saving you Megan.’ Not with his
mouth, but he said it...I’m
assuming telepathically. We had a
connection that I don’t even know
if I can-(sees something behind
Annie)
Oh man, what an asshole I am.
Where’s my manners? You must be
Annie’s husband. I’m Megan.
Annie looks and sees a very smart looking African-American
MAN in his 60’s who is wearing an ascot and smoking a pipe
standing next to her. Megan holds her hand out to shake his.
ANNIE
No, Megan, I’m not with him.
MEGAN
(excited)
Alright, I’m glad he’s single
‘cause I’m gonna climb that like a
tree.

21.
Lillian re-appears, grabs Annie and pulls her away.
LILLIAN
Okay, now I have to introduce you
to Helen.
(looking around)
There she is. Helen! C’mere.
In slow motion, like a goddess, the gorgeous HELEN turns and
looks right at Annie. Smiling. She’s BEAUTIFUL. She walks
toward them, wearing a much-too-fancy, floor-length GOWN.
Everything about her is perfect. Annie swallows, straightens
her plastic beads.
LILLIAN (CONT’D)
Helen, this is Annie.
HELEN
Maid of honor! There she is!
so lovely to meet Lillian’s
childhood friend!

It’s

ANNIE
You’re so pretty.
HELEN
You’re so cute! Oh, you’re so
sweet.
LILLIAN
Helen is married to Dougie’s boss.
Mr. Harris. Perry.
HELEN
And they’re so close now they’re
literally joined at the hip. Which
is good, because so are we.
Helen hugs Lillian. Lillian hugs her back tightly.
seems thrown by their intimacy.
LILLIAN
I’m so glad you guys are finally
meeting.
ANNIE
I know, me too.
HELEN
Oh, if you’ll excuse me I’d better
go check on the (in perfect French)
hors d’oeuvres. So great meeting
you, Annie!

Annie

22.
ANNIE
It’s a great party.
Helen turns and glides off into the crowd, a vision.
watches after her, stunned.

Annie

LILLIAN
She’s great isn’t she?
ANNIE
She’s awesome.
INT. CLUB - LATER - NIGHT
Lillian’s father, ED, finishes a speech.
ED
... and I really do look forward to
having Doug as part of the family.
So much that I think you two should
just get married now. Save me a
shitload of money.
(everyone LAUGHS)
People always laugh when I say that
but I’m not joking. Anyway, thanks
to all of you for coming. Here’s
to Doug and Lillian.
(everyone toasts)
All right, enough of me. Maid of
honor, you’re up. Annie.
Everyone claps, some whistles, as Annie nervously takes the
mic from Ed, who sits down.
ANNIE
Um, hi everyone.

I’m Annie Walker.

LILLIAN
Yay, Annie!
ANNIE
(laughs)
I actually don’t want to go on with
a long speech, so I’ll just say
this. I’m so happy to be a part of
this celebration. You two deserve
each other as well as a lifetime of
happiness. So, cheers!
She raises her glass, people clap. Helen stands clapping and
takes the mic from her. Annie looks a bit surprised. Helen
gives her a smile motioning Annie to sit.

23.
HELEN
Thanks Annie, that was so sweet.
Lill, remember when the four of us
spent that weekend in Miami, and
the boys ended up working the whole
time? You and I sat by the pool the
whole time, drinking wine and
eating that peanut brittle.
(laughs)
We got such a tummy ache! I will
never forget all that we shared on
that trip. I told you things I’ve
never told anyone before. You made
me realize I can trust people
again. So let me just say, Lillian,
you are my best friend.
Annie's mouth drops. People, including Lillian, are moved,
sniffling. Helen wipes away a tear.
HELEN (CONT’D)
(composing herself)
And I’m so proud of you. Now,
‘Dougly’, sorry inside joke, you’d
better not keep my Lill on a leash.
I still need my drunken Saturday
nights at Rockin’ Sushi!
Helen winks. People applaud and LAUGH. She gets emotional
again.
HELEN (CONT’D)
Everybody, raise your glasses to
the couple of the decade: DOUG AND
LILLIAN! Have a great night,
dessert wine is out.
Everyone “Ahh’s” and claps a little bit LOUDER. Without
thinking, Annie stands up and takes the mic from Helen.
ANNIE
I just wanted to say really quick
that you’re SO special to me. One
of the reasons is because I’ve
known you my entire life and you’ve
really helped shape who I am. I
just want to thank you for
carefully selecting me as your Maid
of Honor. I know you had some other
choices. You’re like my sister and
I love you. Well, that concludes
the speeches for the night.

24.
Annie sits down, keeping the mic.
own WIRELESS MIC.

Helen reappears with her

HELEN
Thank you, one last thing. It’s
rare to meet an adult you really
connect with. That’s you Lill. I
went to Thailand recently with my
husband Perry and there was a
beautiful saying that I learned
there. So, let me say ...
(speaks in Thai)
It means, “You are a part of me, a
part that I could never live
without. And I hope and I pray
that I never have to.”
(bowing)
Kap-hoon-kow.
The crowd quiets. Annie looks around the room and sees
everyone is in awe.
HELEN (CONT’D)
That’s it for tonight. Thank you
all for coming, dessert wine is
out. Consuelo?
People are crying and hugging.

Annie pops back up.

ANNIE
Speaking of Consuelo, Lillian and I
took Spanish together in school.
And so I want to say to you and to
everyone here...gracias para vivar
en la casa. En la escuelas and el
azul marcada. Tienes con vivir en
las...forstuatsa, and gracias.
Helen instantly appears again with her mic.
HELEN
I feel so close to you and can
trust you. You’re my angel and
soulmate. I feel I can communicate
with you with simply a look.
Helen “looks” at Lillian.
HELEN (CONT’D)
Thank you for coming.
Helen has concluded the speeches, but Annie’s back.

25.

Lillian...

ANNIE

She stares at Lillian for a long, awkward beat.
ANNIE (CONT’D)
(suddenly singing)
“Keep smilin’. Keep shinin’.
Knowin’ you can always count on me,
for sure, that’s what friends are
for.
Helen steps forward with her now louder mic and in a very
loud R & B voice sings with Annie.
HELEN AND ANNIE
“In good times, in bad times, I’ll
be on your side for ever mooooore.
That’s what friends are fooor!!!”
EXT. HUNT CLUB - NIGHT
Annie is waiting for her car with Lillian.
LILLIAN
(sarcastic)
Engagement parties rule. Made me
feel awesome, like I could go out
and catch another dude to marry.
ANNIE
So what’s up with her anyway?
Helen.
What?

LILLIAN

ANNIE
She’s in your wedding and you’ve
only know her eight months, right?
LILLIAN
Come on, get it out. Get it all
out.
ANNIE
The whole...gown thing. It’s just
weird, right?
Annie laughs.

Lillian smiles and shrugs.

26.
LILLIAN
You know what, she’s actually
really cool Annie. She’s a good
one, I’m telling you.
ANNIE
I’m sure if you like her, I’ll like
her.
LILLIAN
You have to get to know her, which
I think you really should. Will you
just do me a favor and hang out
with her once, just the two of you?
As a favor to me?
ANNIE
Ok. I will.
LILLIAN
I love you Annie.
She hugs her and leaves.
INT. ANNIE’S CAR - NIGHT
ANGRY ROCK MUSIC BLARES. Annie drives fast, angrily swerving
all over the place like a drunk person, but she is only drunk
with indignation.
ANNIE
(mocking) My name is Helen. You
live in Milwaukee? Oh, I’m sorry.
Have you met Lillian? She’s my best
friend. I know we’ve only known
each other for five minutes.
Annie starts doing mocking gibberish like a five year old,
which turns into more fake Thai impressions as she gets
madder and madder. Just then...
A POLICE CAR sounds its siren behind her.
ANNIE (CONT’D)
No, no. Come on.
EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
Annie is walking the line as part of a drunk test.
policeman, OFFICER RHODES, 30’s, watches her walk.

A
He’s all

27.

See.

ANNIE
I’m not drunk.

OFFICER RHODES
So you’re just a terrible driver.
Ha ha.

ANNIE
Can I stop walking now?

OFFICER RHODES
I’ll tell you when to stop walking,
Miss.
ANNIE
I told you I’m not drunk.
was, could I do this?

Hey if I

Annie starts to dance on the “line” she’s supposed to be
walking, then starts to dance. Not well.
RHODES
I would hope so.
(then)
Okay, you can stop walking. I
believe you. But I’m still going
to have to write you a ticket.
What?

ANNIE
Why?

OFFICER RHODES
Funny thing about brake lights.
You’re supposed to have them.
ANNIE
I knew it. Those have been out for
like a year, I’m so stupid. Look,
I promise I’ll get them fixed this
week. I promise.
(then; fake smiling)
Do you still have to give me a
ticket?
He searches for words. She’s cute and he wants to keep her
there. He keeps smiling. Awkward silence.
OFFICER RHODES
Yes, I do. That’s what happens
when you break the law. License
and registration, if you please.
Ugh.

ANNIE
Here.

28.
Starts looking in her purse.
her license.

Awkward silence. She hands him

OFFICER RHODES
Oh, Wynnewood Drive. We’re
practically neighbors. I live on
Ashley.
ANNIE
Oh. I used to work on that street.
OFFICER RHODES
No kidding, where?
ANNIE
I owned a bakery there for a little
bit.
RHODES
Oh, Cake Baby! You’re Cake Baby.
You had your sign, it was your
face, that was you.
ANNIE
That was me.
RHODES
You made good cakes.
Thanks.

ANNIE

RHODES
You used to make these little
pastries, you’d put something in
them like a cream or a custard?
ANNIE
Cream puffs.
RHODES
Cream puffs, that’s what you called
them. Delicious. I used to get
served by a tall broad guy, with a
wormy face.
ANNIE
My boyfriend.
Sorry.

RHODES

29.
ANNIE
No, he was my boyfriend. But then
he left when the business went
under.
RHODES
You’re kidding. What a dick. I’m
glad I never tipped him.
Rhodes stares at her.

He thinks, then rips the ticket up.

OFFICER RHODES
Let’s forget about this. Under one
condition. Get those lights fixed
tomorrow so you don’t kill anyone.
He hands her a business card.
OFFICER RHODES (CONT’D)
Here. It’s a buddy of mine. His
body shop’s in Milwaukee.
ANNIE
(reading)
Bill... Cozbi’s?
RHODES
With a “z”. Different guy. Don’t
mention the whole Bill Cosby thing
to him, it drives him nuts. I mean
it.
ANNIE
Ok, I get it. Thanks.
RHODES
You know what, if you mention my
name that I referred you, he’ll
give you a particularly good deal.
ANNIE
Oh, thank you. I really appreciate
it, thanks.
RHODES
Well I appreciated your cakes, so
we’re even.
He takes back the card and writes on it.
OFFICER RHODES
That’s my name right there. Rhodes.
Officer Rhodes.

30.
ANNIE
That’s really nice of you, thank
you.
OFFICER RHODES
We’re not all bad. Actually, the
rest of them are, but not me. Haha.
I’m the best of them.
Thank you.

ANNIE

She waves and drives off.

He watches her go.

INT. ANNIE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Annie is in her small kitchen, surrounded by baking supplies.
She is meticulously putting the finishing touches on the most
elaborate cupcake ever. It’s a work of art, the frosting
sculpted into a realistic looking 3D orchid. It’s beautiful.
Annie finishes, looks at the cupcake, SIGHS sadly and eats it
in two bites, then heads off to bed. All the work and mess
was for one cupcake.
EXT. TENNIS CLUB - DAY
Annie and Helen are walking through the tennis club on their
way to the courts, chatting before their big game.
HELEN
I didn’t know you played tennis.
ANNIE
I played a little in high school.
HELEN
I’m so glad we were able to do
this.
ANNIE
I’m glad we’re doing this too. It’s
good we’re finally getting a chance
to hang out.
HELEN
I know right?
Neither of them means it.

31.
HELEN (CONT’D)
It’s too bad Lillian couldn’t play
with us. Poor thing is so busy.
ANNIE
She’s not really that into sports.
Even when we were little, she
didn’t like anything too
competitive.
HELEN
Well she certainly enjoys tennis
now. It’s funny how people change,
isn’t it?
ANNIE
I don’t know, do people really
change?
HELEN
I think they do.
ANNIE
But they still stay who they are,
pretty much.
HELEN
I think we change all the time.
ANNIE
I think we stay the same, but grow
a little bit.
HELEN
I think if you’re growing, then
you’re changing.
ANNIE
But we’re changing from who we are,
which we always stay as.
HELEN
Not really, I don’t think so.
RYAN, 16, and ALYSSA, 13, pass by.

Helen stops them.

HELEN (CONT’D)
Oh, Annie, these are my kids.
ALYSSA
Step kids. Step.

32.
HELEN
(trying to joke)
Aren’t they hilarious? Excuse me,
my husband’s kids, Ryan and Alyssa.
What are you guys up to?
ALYSSA
(lots of attitude)
We’re going to the snack bar.
HELEN
Do you need a ride home later?
RYAN
Fuck off, Helen.
They walk off.

Helen calls after them cheerily.

HELEN
Okay, put a quarter in the swear
jar!
(to Annie)
So cute.
ANNIE
Sweet kids.
They both smile warmly at each other.
EXT. TENNIS COURT - DAY
Helen and Annie stare intensely at each other across the net.
Helen is with her partner BARBARA, a rich, fit woman in her
40’s. Annie is teamed with CAROL, also rich but in less
great shape. Helen smashes a serve to Annie, who returns it
ferociously.
IN A SERIES OF SHOTS as cinematic and violent as the pool
scene in Scorsese’s “The Color of Money,” we see Helen and
Annie have an intense showdown. Annie unloads on the ball,
hitting Helen in the left breast as hard as humanly possible.
WHACK! WHACK! WHACK! Annie and Helen smash the ball into
each other’s breast, chest, neck, and “other female parts”,
with insane intensity. It is super violent.
Annie’s partner, Carol, misses a shot.
ANNIE
(to her partner)
Come on! Get your shit together!

33.
ALL ANNIE’S POV: She serves hard and runs Helen around the
court.
Annie accidentally serves very hard directly into Carol’s
back, knocking her down.
Helen’s step kids are watching and laugh.
RYAN
I’ve seen better tennis playing in
a tampon commercial.
INT. ANNIE’S APARTMENT - DAY
Annie, Gil, and Brynn sit on the couch.
ANNIE
I’ve been thinking. Brynn needs to
start paying rent. That’s it. She’s
been here long enough. The three of
us live here, it’s not fair for me
to be paying half. We split it
three ways, what do you say?
GIL
Well she can’t work, she’s on a
tourist Visa.
BRYNN
Yeah. So technically I’m only
allowed to tour. I have no way of
earning money unless I go
prostitute down on the street.
ANNIE
I don’t want you to do that.
BRYNN
“Hello fellas, here I am. Put your
American sausage in my English
McMuffin.”
ANNIE
I don’t even know what you’re
talking about anymore. There are
three people living here. If she
doesn’t start paying, she has to
leave.
GIL
Is this about the diary again?

34.
ANNIE
What diary?
BRYNN
Your diary proved very interesting
to read.
ANNIE
You read my journal??
BRYNN
At first I did not know that it was
your diary. I thought it was a very
sad, hand-written book. But then
because of the personal details and
the bits that mentioned Gil and
Brynn...
ANNIE
No, no, no. Don’t read my journal.
Don’t go in my room.
GIL
Well, hello, I think before you
make those sort of demands you need
to think about putting a note on
your door that says “Don’t come
into my room, read my diary, and
wear my clothes.”
EXT. CHURRA-CHI BRAZILIAN RESTAURANT - DAY
Annie and the bridesmaids stand in a parking lot of a standalone Brazilian steak-house in a not-great part of town.
Lillian looks shocked.
BECCA
Wow, I’ve never been to this part
of town.
HELEN
Look, you can get your checks
cashed next door.
ANNIE
I know it looks a little scary from
the outside, but the food is really
good. Authentic Brazilian. This is
where Brazilian’s come to eat.
We’re not quite sure if she thinks so.

35.
LILLIAN
Annie’s really good at this. She
always drags me to the weirdest
places and the food is always
incredible.
ANNIE
Plus, you get a lot for your money
too, so that’s good.
Annie grabs Lillian and pulls her toward the restaurant as
the other girls follow. As Helen stares at the place like
she just smelt dog shit...
INT. CHURRA-CHI BRAZILIAN RESTAURANT - DAY
The girls walk into the Brazilian-themed restaurant, which
looks more like a rundown English steakhouse. Several OUT OF
SHAPE WAITERS walk around, each holding a sword with huge
hunks of meat on it. Only a few customers are there.
LILLIAN
To my bridesmaids...this is such a
stone cold pack of weirdos and I’m
so proud.
The girls all laugh and click glasses.
ANNIE
I just want to toast all of you
ladies. So happy to get to know you
guys and happy to say I have four
new friends.
Just then, five waiters all holding HUGE SWORDS with
different types of MEAT skewered on them surround the table.
WAITER
Senoritas bonitas, I hope you’re
all hungry for Churrasco Brazil.
The girls all look excited and start pointing at different
meats as the waiters start to carve large hunks onto their
plates. Helen wrinkles her nose and flags the waiter.
LILLIAN
This is crazy good.
BECCA
Helen, aren’t you eating any meat?
The girls are scarfing down tons of food. Helen picks away
at her salad. Everyone’s having a great time.

36.
HELEN
It’s not good to eat a big meal
before a fitting, I’ll feel a bit
bloated.
MEGAN
Not me, nope. Physically, I don’t
bloat.
LILLIAN
You’re lucky.
MEGAN
It’s a gift.
Becca leans over to Rita.
BECCA
I can’t wait to be married for as
long as you’ve been married. And to
have kids. To be a mom.
RITA
Oh, Becca. The other night I’m
slaving away to make a beautiful
dinner for my family. My youngest
boy comes in and says he wants to
order pizza. I say ‘no we aren’t
ordering pizza tonight.’ He says,
‘Mom, why don't you go fuck
yourself.’ He’s nine.
INT. CHURRA-CHI BRAZILIAN RESTAURANT - A LITTLE LATER
The girls continue to eat.

Lillian’s seat is empty.

ANNIE
Okay, while Lillian’s in the
bathroom, let’s talk about the
shower. I was thinking it could
have a French theme, since
Lillian’s always wanted to go to
Paris her whole life. So I figured
we could bring Paris here. Have
champagne and little cookies,
they’d say “Lillian and Dougie” on
them, we can dip them in chocolate
fondue. Get cheese from the nice
part of the store.
MEGAN
I love that.

37.
BECCA
Good idea Annie.
ANNIE
We can have French invitations, the
whole thing. Don’t you think that
would be nice?
The women like that idea.
HELEN
Mmm, I don’t know. That’s sweet,
Annie, but a Paris theme feels a
bit ... I don’t know, “been there,
done that”. You know? I just think
we can top it. We should throw some
ideas around. See if anyone else
has a theme they had in mind.
BECCA
What about a Pixar themed shower?
We all come dressed as our favorite
Pixar character.
MEGAN
I’ll just snowball on top of that.
Also, Fightclub. Female fightclub.
We grease up, we pull in, Lillian
doesn’t know, so it’s ‘Surprise!
Were gonna fight.’ We beat the shit
out her. She’s not gonna forget
that.
RITA
Look, can I be honest? I’m stuck
with three teenage boys all day
every day. What about the
bachelorette party? I got a tube
top I’ve been waiting to cut the
tags off of and I really want to
take advantage of this opportunity.
MEGAN
I’m gonna second her. We better
blow this shit out. That poor girl
Lillian who we’re all here for is
probably in the bathroom balling
her eyes out because she’s
realizing ‘holy shit, I’ve got to
spend the rest of my life with
Doug.’ He’s my brother, I love him,
but he’s a fucking asshole. I think
we can all agree on that, right?

38.
ANNIE
We’ll figure it out. I’ll think of
stuff. It’ll be great.
HELEN
We just have to make sure it’s
really, really special.
EXT. ‘BELLE EN BLANC’ BRIDAL SHOP - DAY
The bridesmaids walk up to an imposing building.
BECCA
Belle En Blanc! This is the best
place. Great work, Annie.
Annie looks proud. She grabs the door which says “OPEN” but
it’s locked. She notices a buzzer and presses it.
VOICE FROM INSIDE
Belle En Blanc. Reservation name?
ANNIE
Oh, I don’t have one. We’re just
here to shop, try on some dresses.
VOICE FROM INSIDE
The next available appointment for
bridesmaids fittings is in seven
weeks. Absolutely no walk-ins.
Helen leans into the intercom.
HELEN
Whitney, it’s Helen.
WHITNEY
Helen Harris?! Hiiii!
Hiiii!

HELEN

Hiiii!

WHITNEY

WHITNEY (CONT’D)
Oh my god, I’ll buzz you right in.
INT. ‘BELLE EN BLANC’ BRIDAL SHOP - CONTINUOUS
They are led into a PRISTINE, ALL-WHITE WONDERLAND of dresses
and bridal bliss by WHITNEY, a glamorous woman.

39.
WHITNEY
Welcome to Belle En Blanc ladies,
welcome to heaven.
ANNIE
Oh my god ...
MEGAN
This is some classy shit in here-A burp escapes Megan’s mouth!
RITA
Jesus Christ, Megan.
MEGAN
I want to apologize. I’m not even
confident on which end that came
out of. Whitney, back to you, I’m
sorry.
WHITNEY
Anyway, take a look around and get
to know the dresses. If you need
anything I’ll be in my office.
Whitney just gives Megan a tense smile and exits. Helen
GASPS and walks over to a beautiful ball gown. It looks very
expensive. She checks the tag.
HELEN
Oh. My. Gosh. It’s a Fritz
Bernaise. Ladies, I just don’t
think we can do any better. This is
beautiful.
The girls all gather around it and “OOO” and “AAH”.
ANNIE
(only to Helen)
Whoa, this dress is $800.
HELEN
You’re kidding. It’s on sale!
Annie’s eyes quickly scan the room and see a simpler,
cheaper dress. She heads over to it. The tag says $250.
ANNIE
Lillian. Lillian. What about this
one? It’s really pretty and sweet.
We don’t want to upstage Lillian
with a fancy dress.
(MORE)

40.
ANNIE (CONT'D)
Maybe we should get something kind
of simple?
LILLIAN
Don’t worry about that. Because,
guess who Helen is friends and who
is designing my wedding dress? Lady
St. Petsois JuJu. I just sent my
measurements to France!
The girls all chatter excitedly about this as Annie looks
stung. She looks at Helen, who smiles at her.
HELEN
Ladies, let’s not decide on this
bridesmaids dress straight away.
Let’s let our bodies decide. Try
some things on and have some fun.
Ladies, start your engines.
The ladies all head off excitedly to different dresses as
Annie looks concerned. A drip of sweat comes down her
forehead. Embarrassed, she wipes it away and grabs a dress.
INT. BELLE EN BLANC - MAIN FITTING AREA - LATER
The girls are in different dresses. Lillian is not there.
They look great, although Megan’s face is beet red.
WHITNEY
Well you all look fantastic.
Sadly, you need to agree on one.
HELEN
Ladies, you all look beautiful. But
personally, the Fritz Bernaise,
it’s one of a kind. I don’t think
there’s a question.
ANNIE
There might be a question. I might
have one. I think this dress would
look great on everybody. It’s a
great color, it’s a great length,
it’s fun, you can twirl, you can
move in it, you can...spread your
legs apart. And it’s a great price.
MEGAN
(sweating, red)
Is anybody else hot?

41.
RITA
It’s like an oven in here.
WHITNEY
Maybe this will help you decide. I
happened to have a two year old
Lady JuJu dress in storage in the
back and figured it might help you
see what you’ll be standing next
to. Lillian?
Lillian walks out in a very ornate COUTURE wedding dress.
She looks crazy gorgeous. The girls GASP.
RITA
(fanning herself)
Holy shit, you look amazing.
MEGAN
That dress is so beautiful it makes
my stomach hurt.
ANNIE
Lill, I don’t know what to say.
You are-Megan lurches forward as the contents of her stomach come up
into her mouth. She claps her hand over her mouth to stop
from throwing up. After a beat, she swallows and pushes it
back down. Looks nauseous.
ANNIE (CONT’D)
Megan, are you okay?
MEGAN
I think my dress is too tight.
HELEN
Oh my god. You got food poisoning
from that restaurant.
ANNIE
(sweating)
No. No. She had the same thing I
had and I feel fine.
Annie is really sweaty now, a mark between her boobs.
Suddenly, Becca politely cups her hand over her mouth to
stifle herself from getting sick.
BECCA
(muffled, through her
hands)
I’m so sorry. Is there a bathroom?

42.
Rita grabs her stomach and hunches over a bit.
RITA
I don’t care what dress we get, I
just need to get off this white
carpet.
We hear a noise.
They all stand in horrified silence, Becca still holding her
hands against her face. There are faint (and loud) stomach
CHURNING sounds.
Rita bolts down a hallway, followed by Becca and Megan.
WHITNEY
Not the bathroom! Everybody go
outside! Seriously!
Whitney and Lillian chase after them as Annie stands her
ground with Helen, facing off, Annie unwilling to admit she’s
sick.
ANNIE
I think everyone has the flu.
INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
The single toilet bathroom is as PRISTINE and WHITE as the
fitting area. Everything is just right. Calm and quiet.
Classical music plays softly.
BLAM! The door bursts open as Rita runs in. She projectile
vomits into the toilet...but the seat is down. Everything
sprays onto the back wall.
Shit!

RITA

Rita slams the top open and heaves again into the bowl as
Megan runs in holding her backside.
MEGAN
I need the toilet!
toilet!

I need the

Rita ignores her as her head is in it and she grips the
sides, barfing. In desperation, Megan hikes up her dress,
hops up onto the counter, and SITS in the SINK. Rita looks
back at Megan.
No, Megan!

RITA
Megan, no!!!

43.

Look away!

MEGAN
Look away!

INT. BELLE EN BLANC - MAIN FITTING AREA - CONTINUOUS
Helen and Annie are faced off.

Annie is sweating profusely.

HELEN
You don’t look very well Annie.
ANNIE
I feel fine.
HELEN
Are you sure? It wasn’t that grey
kind of lamb? You ate a lot of that
weird chicken. Was it that?
ANNIE
No. I feel fine.
HELEN
I think you’d just feel better if
you threw up.
ANNIE
I don’t have to throw up.
INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
Becca runs in blindly over the toilet that Rita is still
barfing in. Vomit rains down on the back of Rita’s head.
BECCA
I’m so sorry.
RITA
Get away from me!
INT. BELLE EN BLANC - MAIN FITTING AREA - CONTINUOUS
The stand-off continues.

Annie is soaked and woozy.

HELEN
You’re not sick.
ANNIE
No. In fact, I’m feeling hungry. I
wish I had a snack.

44.
HELEN
You’re hungry?
ANNIE
I’m starving.
INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
MEGAN
What did we eat??! This sink’s a
goner.
BECCA
(noticing her on the sink)
What are you doing?
MEGAN
It’s comin’ out of me like lava!
Don’t fucking look at me!!
INT. BELLE EN BLANC - MAIN FITTING AREA - CONTINUOUS
Helen picks up a bowl off a table next to her.
ANNIE
Jordan almonds. These are great,
thank you.
Annie takes a handful and painfully puts them in her mouth,
chewing them slowly. She forces it and swallows the almonds
down with a slow gulp.
Better?

HELEN

ANNIE
I was just hungry.
A sweaty Lillian runs up to Annie, who is still faced off
with Helen.
LILLIAN
Annie, everyone’s really sick from
that restaurant.
Lillian gets a look on her face.
GURGLES loudly.

She grabs her stomach as it

ANNIE
It wasn’t the restaurant.

45.
LILLIAN
Oh no. I. Am. In trouble. I need a
bathroom.
She turns and bolts away.

Annie runs after her.

ANNIE
Lillian, where are you going?
EXT. BELLE EN BLANC - CONTINUOUS
Lillian bursts out of the building and runs across the street
toward a 7-11. Cars SCREECH to a halt to avoid the fleeing
bride. Annie runs out and watches in horror.
Lillian!
careful!

ANNIE
What are you doing? Be

LILLIAN
It’s happening, it’s happening.
Suddenly Lillian stops running and slowly sinks down onto the
ground, embarrassed and unable to move. She throws a
helpless look back at Annie.
LILLIAN (CONT’D)
Oh, it’s happening...it happened.
In the doorway, Whitney and Annie watch it all in horror.
WHITNEY
Oh no, don’t you dare ruin that
dress!
ANNIE
Oh, you’re really doing it aren’t
ya? You’re shittin’ in the street.
After a beat, Helen walks up behind Whitney.
HELEN
(re: the expensive dress)
We’ll just take five of the Fritz
Bernaise Whitney, thank you.
INT. ANNIE’S CAR - DAY
A green looking Annie drives a green looking Lillian, who is
back in her regular clothes.

46.

You okay?

ANNIE

LILLIAN
I just took a shit in the middle of
the street. I just shit.
ANNIE
People do that.
LILLIAN
I shit in my shorts. I shit myself.
INT. TED’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Annie and Ted lay in bed, post-coital.

Still panting.

TED
That was fun.
ANNIE
Oh my gosh. You know what I was
thinking? You should come with me
to Lillian’s wedding maybe. Nothing
serious, just a fun time. We can
get dressed up, go dancing, drink.
It will be fun right?
TED
(chuckling warmly)
I don’t want to put you in a
position of having to explain to
everyone who I am and what our
relationship is. You know? That
would suck for you. Right?
ANNIE
Yeah, I guess so.
TED
I’m just thinking of you.
ANNIE
That’s okay.
(lying)
I have someone else to bring
anyways.
TED
Really? Who? Who are you gonna
bring?
Annie struggles to think of a name.

47.
ANNIE
(lying)
This guy George.
Ted grabs a glass of water from the night-stand and takes a
sip. Idea!
ANNIE (CONT’D)
George Glass.
Ok?

TED
Who is this George?

ANNIE
He is a very hot, nice guy who
likes me a lot and would probably
love to be my date.
TED
Really? Well let me ask you this,
can George Glass do this to you?
Ted intensely cups her breast and just rubs it in a circle.
Probably?

You know what, it’s getting really
late. You should probably go. I’m
gonna miss you so much.

“Calm,” “Focus,” “Sex

OFFICER RHODES (O.S.)
Annie Walker. What brings you here
so early?
ANNIE
Oh, hey. Just had a bad night. Boy
stuff.
OFFICER RHODES
You want me to arrest anybody? I
could do that.
ANNIE
Actually...

48.
OFFICER RHODES
Do you want to talk to a cop about
it? We’re just like priests, except
we can tell everybody about it
afterwords. I won’t though.
ANNIE
That doesn’t sound very inviting.
He approaches her, holding a bag of carrots.
OFFICER RHODES
You want a carrot?
Annie stares at him, considering.
Right now?

ANNIE

OFFICER RHODES
Yea, I’ll share. I’ve got plenty.
ANNIE
Sure, I’ll have a carrot.
EXT. MINI MART - NIGHT
Annie and Rhodes sit on the hood of his cop car in front of
the mini mart, sharing a bag of carrots.
RHODES
That sounds rough.
ANNIE
It’s gonna get better, right?
RHODES
I’m sure it will get better. My
sister was the maid of honor at our
cousin’s wedding and she found it
so stressful, her hair started
falling out.
ANNIE
That’s terrible.
RHODES
It grew back. But it was pretty
gross. Planning a wedding should be
fun. If I ever had a wedding, I’d
want everyone to be stress free.
I’d like it to be like a carnival.

49.
RHODES (CONT'D)
People win prizes for guessing the
brides weight, dunk tanks...
ANNIE
You could have elephants, the bride
and groom could walk on a tight
rope...
RHODES
What you’re talking about there is
a circus wedding. That is a totally
different thing. You missed it.
ANNIE
(smiles)
Sorry.
RHODES
You know, instead of spending your
money and time on all this wedding
business, you should really be
figuring out how to open your next
bakery.
ANNIE
I’m done with all that.
What?

RHODES

ANNIE
I don’t do it anymore.
Rhodes studies Annie a beat. She takes another carrot. It’s a
small dried-out carrot.
ANNIE (CONT’D)
Ew, this one’s weird.
RHODES
Oh, you got the ugly carrot.
There’s one in every bag. You have
to eat it, it’s good luck.
ANNIE
I’m not eating this.
RHODES
Yeah. I’ll eat it.
He goes to eat it.
No, no!

She grabs it out of his hands.
ANNIE
Don’t eat it!

EW!!!

50.
She throws it on the ground.
RHODES
Hey hey, don’t litter, I’ll fine
you. Haha (then) Seriously, that
really bothers me.
He picks it up.

Annie watches him, a bit intrigued.

ANNIE
I didn’t know you could be a cop
here if you weren’t a citizen.
RHODES
You can’t. But they made a special
dispensation because I’m so tough
and strong...and handsome.
ANNIE
Right. You’re a tough cop.
RHODES
You’re saying that but you’re
laughing.
Annie feels his bicep.
RHODES (CONT’D)
You didn’t let me flex that time,
that was unfair. I’m really tough.
ANNIE
So am I. I could be a cop.
RHODES
You think you could be a cop?
Yeah.

ANNIE

RHODES
Okay, let’s see. Sun is nearly up,
let’s see if you’ve got what it
takes.
EXT. ROAD - MORNING
Annie is standing in front of Rhodes’ cop car on the side of
the road, holding up the speed gun, aiming it. Rhodes sits
on the hood and continues to eat his food.

51.
RHODES
That’s right. Arms straight.
Plant your feet. Now, what you
want to do is aim it right at the
license plate. That gives you the
most accurate reading.
A car zooms by.
ANNIE
Fifty-eight. What’s the speed
limit here?
RHODES
Fifty-five.
ANNIE
Okay, we’ll let them go.
RHODES
You were born to do this, look at
you.
Another car zooms by.
ANNIE
Sixty-three. You’re missing some
good ones here.
RHODES
Ah, they’re probably going to work.
Why ruin their day?
Another car is approaching.

Rhodes looks at it.

RHODES (CONT’D)
Watch this. Forty-eight.
The car zooms past.
ANNIE
Forty-eight! How’d you do that?
RHODES
It wasn’t! That has never happened
before. It was forty-eight?
ANNIE
Yeah, forty-eight. I’m pretty
impressed.
RHODES
I’m pretty impressive.

52.
Annie gives him an impressed look, then goes back to pointing
a fun as Rhodes watches her. He smiles. A car roars by.
ANNIE
Oh, that one was ninety-three! Can
we go?
RHODES
Okay, hot shot. Let’s go get the
fucker.
Annie whoops, delighted.

They jump in the car and drive off.

INT. ANNIE’S BEDROOM
A fired-up Annie goes to the computer and starts typing
feverishly
We see words she types: “Bachelorette party!,” “LILLIAN’S
LAKE HOUSE,” “campfires,” “Beer and s’mores,” etc.
She presses send, and is very pleased. The phone immediately
rings. Annie picks it up. INTERCUT BETWEEN CALLS.
Hello?

ANNIE

Helen sits in her BEAUTIFUL home, looking at her laptop.
HELEN
I just got your e-mail.
house?

Um...lake

ANNIE
(polite but firm)
It’s Lillian’s parents’ house, we
used to go there all the time in
the summers.
HELEN
A bachelorette party at a cabin?
Annie’s call waiting BEEPS again.

She deflates.

ANNIE
Oh, just a sec, Helen.
(she clicks over)
Hello?
Rita in her “new money” kitchen, straight out of the
Soprano’s. Her three boys are fighting and playing.

53.
RITA
Annie, it’s Rita. I need a trip
that I can fantasize about forever
so that I’m able to have sex with
my husband. That’s why I’m thinking
Vegas.
Annie glances down at her $350 PAYCHECK.
Vegas?

ANNIE
Really?

RITA
Hang on.
(to boys)
Shut your filthy mouths!
(to Annie)
I’m sorry, I’m surrounded by
savages.
Annie’s call waiting BEEPS again.
ANNIE
You know I should probably run, my
other line is ringing.
RITA
I can get cocaine from my hair
dresser.
Bye!

ANNIE

Becca, in her shabby-chic home office, paints a front porch
sign that says “The Whitman’s.”
BECCA
Annie, I’m so excited. Helen just
called, she said we could go to
Vegas.
ANNIE
But we’d have to fly there.
BECCA
Annie, I know you’re afraid of
flying but I want to see Criss
Angel! But I’m scared, which I sort
of love.
Annie’s call waiting BEEPS again. She clicks over.
Megan is in front of a wall of computer and television
screens. It is a TECHNICAL HAVEN that looks like NASA.

54.
MEGAN
Annie, it’s Megan. Just had some
thoughts about the bachelorette
party. Here we go, easy-peasy,
Vegas it is.
ANNIE
Helen called you, didn’t she.
MEGAN
Yeah, she got the jump on you.
RITA
I want balls in my face.
HELEN
Honestly, I think it’s Vegas.
BECCA
I love puppets!
Balls!

RITA

ANNIE
I guess were undecided?
INT - JETWAY - DAY
The women are dressed to the NINES, heading to the plane,
excited. Annie tails the group, looking very afraid. She
takes a breath and gets on board.
INT. COACH SECTION - DAY
Annie settles into her seat next to a PREGNANT WOMAN who’s
reading. Annie forces a smile at her. The woman gives her a
dismissive smile. This is not going to be a fun flight.
INT. FIRST CLASS - DAY
The bridesmaids settle in.

Lillian sits next to Helen.

LILLIAN
I feel so bad that Annie’s stuck
back in coach.
HELEN
I tried to buy her a first class
ticket but she wouldn’t let me.
She’s too proud.

55.
LILLIAN
That was really nice of you.
Behind them, Megan sits next to an middle-aged man, JON.
looks down at his feet.

She

MEGAN
No carry on? I noticed you didn’t
put anything in the overhead bin.
I get it. Protect and serve ...
(leaning in)
... Air Marshal style.
What?

MAN

MEGAN
Listen, I don't want to infringe on
your privacy, but I want you to
know I appreciate your service to
this country and I respect the hell
out of you.
She mimes a key locking her lips shut.
JON
Huh? No, I’m not an Air Marshal.
I’m gonna take a nap.
MEGAN
Awesome, I’ll take the first watch.
JON
I’m not an Air Marshal. You don’t
need to take a watch.
MEGAN
Ok. I’ve got the first watch.
She raises her eyebrows at Jon, who doesn’t notice.
INT. COACH SECTION - MOMENTS LATER
The plane is taking off. Annie grips the armrest, trying to
maintain her composure but SHEER TERROR takes over.
ANNIE
Woooooooo .... Oh god. I’m really
hoping this flight is quick and we
get there on the ground safely. I’m
sorry, I’m not a good flier.
The pregnant woman is even more freaked out than Annie.

56.
PREGNANT WOMAN
I had a dream last night that we
went down. It was terrible. You
were in it.
The plane is ascending now.

It jolts a bit.

PREGNANT WOMAN (CONT’D)
Oh god, it sounds like something’s
happening.
Annie is officially terrified.
INT. FIRST CLASS - MOMENTS LATER
The plane is still ascending, everyone strapped in. Annie
comes through the curtain and approaches, struggling to walk
uphill as the plane ascends.
LILLIAN
Annie, what are you doing? You’re
supposed to be in your seat.
ANNIE
I know but I’m freaking out.
FEMALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT
(yelling from jump seat)
Ma’am, we are still ascending!
Please return to your seat.
ANNIE
Okay. Yeah, I was just -HELEN
Annie, I have something. Take two,
you’ll fall asleep. When you wake
up and we’ll be there.
Annie looks at the pill in Helen’s palm. Considers. The
plane hits a bump of turbulence. Annie looks at Lillian who
shrugs like “What the hell, do it.”
FEMALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Ma’am, you’re going to have to
return to your seat please.
ANNIE
Thank you, Helen.
Annie goes back to coach.

57.
LILLIAN
God I feel terrible. I should be
sitting back there with her, I
shouldn’t be in first class. I feel
like such a jerk.
HELEN
Lill, this is your weekend. You are
treating yourself, relax. She will
make friends. There’s much more of
a sense of community in coach, I
promise you. She’ll be fine.
INT. FIRST CLASS - A LITTLE LATER
Rita has a cocktail.
RITA
You’ve never been with anyone
else?!
BECCA
Nope. Just Kevin.
RITA
I’m sorry Becca. I just can’t help
but feel bad for you. You don’t
even know what you want.
Becca looks perplexed. In front of them, Megan is flirting
with Jon.
MEGAN
I gotta know where you keep the gun
man. Ankle, hip, lower back? You
don’t...between the cheeks?
JON
No, I don’t stick a gun up my butt.
That’s stupid.
MEGAN
I didn’t say “up”. I just know of a
guy that did a lot of undercover
work...all I know is that he had
tape marks all up and down his
cheeks.
JON
That can’t be true. People don’t
keep guns up their asses because if
you needed to use it, how are you
gonna get it?

58.
MEGAN
He cut a hole in his back pocket.
You’ve gotta get something out of
your ass and you cut a hole in the
back of your jeans, you want to
tell me you can’t get to something?
JON
I don’t have a gun for you to put
up my ass to make your point.
MEGAN
I can put my Nano. I will show you.
If you get me scissors, I will cut
a hole in my pocket...
(holding up her ipod)
And you’ll never find this again.
Until I want you to find it.
Behind them, Rita and Becca are talking.
BECCA
(thrown)
Kevin can only have sex in the bed.
In the dark. Under the covers.
After we shower. Separately.
Sometimes by the time we’re
finished cleaning ourselves he’s
too tired. Then I pretend I’m
tired, but I’m not tired. I’m not
tired.
Rita gives her a look like “WHAT?”
RITA
See that’s why every girl needs
those slutty college years to
experiment and get it out of their
system, find out what you like.
Becca’s eye are wide. She signals the flight attendant.
BECCA
Excuse me, could I have a glass of
alcohol when you get a chance.
RITA
Two double Seven and Sevens.
(to Becca)
You’ll like it, it’s sweet.

59.
INT. COACH CLASS - CONTINUOUS
Annie is FIDGETING. The pregnant lady is freaked.
PREGNANT WOMAN
I have to go to the bathroom, but I
heard about a woman who went to the
bathroom on a plane, and she got
sucked into the toilet. Sucked
right in.
This is not helping Annie. Helen comes back.
HELEN
Are you okay?
ANNIE
Yes. I think what you gave me
didn’t do anything. I have too much
adrenaline or something.
Helen hands a cocktail to Annie.
HELEN
Here, take my Scotch. This’ll just
give that pill the kick it needs.
I do it all the time. And I have a
much smaller build than you.
Thanks.

ANNIE

Helen gives her a wink and heads up back to first class.
PREGNANT WOMAN
You should just toss it back. Don’t
waste anymore time.
Annie downs the glass.
ANNIE
Okay, that will do it.
INT. FIRST CLASS - DAY
Becca and Rita are drinking.
BECCA
So you don’t even have sex anymore?

60.
RITA
Oh no, I have sex constantly. The
sex is constant. But he hasn’t
kissed me in five years.
BECCA
What are you doing when you’re
having sex then?
RITA
Thinking about other things and
wishing it would stop. Sometimes I
just want to watch The Daily Show
without him entering me.
Helen and Lillian are drinking champagne. The curtain sweeps
open and a drugged Annie comes sauntering in.
HELEN
And then we’re going to the MGM
Grand Wet Republic Ultra Pool. The
people from the Real World go there
all the time.
LILLIAN
I'm so excited!
Annie pops up next to them, rubs Lillian’s head.
LILLIAN (CONT’D)
Hey buddy, how ya doin?
Annie gives her a big druggy smile, then leans on the back of
Lillian's chair.
ANNIE
I’m goooood. I’m so much more
relaxed now. Thank you Helen. I
just feel like I’m excited, I’m
relaxed, I’m ready to
paaaaarrrtttyyyy...
(starts singing)
...with the best of them. And I’m
gonna go down to the river!
LILLIAN
Wow, it looks like someone is
really relaxing now.
ANNIE
What are you guys talking about up
here?

61.
HELEN
We’re going to a restaurant
tonight, I know the owner...
ANNIE
(mocking) You do? Oooh, Helen. Woo
woo. Helen knows the owner. Big
whoop.
LILLIAN
Hey Annie, let’s go take a nap.
What do you say?
STEVE, A MALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT appears.
MALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Miss, you cannot be up here.
ANNIE
Hello grandpa. I’m sorry, I just
want to be up here with my friends.
I’m with this group.
LILLIAN
Yeah, can she just stay up here for
a while? The sign's off.
MALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT
No. Coach passengers aren’t allowed
up here in first class. It’s
policy. Sorry.
ANNIE
Gosh, this plane is very strict.
Welcome to Germany. Okay, I'm
gonna go take a nap.
LILLIAN
I think that’s a good idea.
ANNIE
Catch you on the flip side
muthafuckas!
LILLIAN
I’m sorry, she’s -ANNIE
I’m leaving.
Annie sweeps open the curtain and steps into coach.

62.
ANNIE (CONT’D)
This should be open, it’s civil
rights. This is the 90’s.
MALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Right, it’s not. You’re in the
wrong decade.
You are.

ANNIE

MALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Okay right, I am.
LILLIAN
Holy shit, what did you give her?
She looks at Helen, who shrugs like “I don’t know what’s
wrong with her.”
INT. FIRST CLASS - MOMENTS LATER
Annie comes back into first class wearing SUNGLASSES and sits
down next to a man who looks like Enrique Iglesias.
Miss.

MALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT

ANNIE
No, it’s not me.
MALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Yes, it’s you. Please go back to
your seat.
ANNIE
I’m with him. I’m Mrs. Iglesias.
MALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT
No you’re not. You were just up
here and you put sunglasses on.
Out.
ANNIE
I don’t want to.
Lillian and Helen get up from their seats.

63.
HELEN
She can have my seat. Everyone
should experience first class in
their lives and I don't want Annie
to miss out just because she
couldn't afford a ticket.
FEMALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT
I’m afraid it’s not allowed, ma’am.
ANNIE
Help me, I’m poor.
LILLIAN
(to flight attendant)
Please. We’re a whole wedding
party, I’m the bride. I’m getting
married. The seat is empty. She’s
obviously nervous. We’ll calm her
down.
MALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT
I understand, but Claire is right -ANNIE
Everyone get back to your seats.
MALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT
You especially. You have three
seconds to get back to your seat.
ANNIE
You can’t get anywhere in three
seconds.
MALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Well, you’ve gotta try.
ANNIE
You’re setting me up for a loss
already. Whatever you say...
(reading his name tag)
Stove.
MALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT
It’s Steve.
ANNIE
Stove, what kind of name is that.
MALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT
That’s not a name. My name is
Steve.

64.
ANNIE
Are you an appliance?
MALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT
No, I’m a man and my name is Steve.
ANNIE
You’re a flight attendant.
MALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT
That’s absolutely accurate.
The flight attendant glares at her.

Annie leaps back into

AT THE FRONT OF THE PLANE
Jon walks out of the bathroom. Megan is right there, two
inches from the door. Talks quietly to him.
MEGAN
Hey, “not-Air-Marshal Jon”. Maybe
we should go back into the restroom
and not rest.
JON
I should get back to my seat.
MEGAN
Yeah, you’ve got to get back ... on
my seat. You get it?
JON
I definitely get it.
Megan swings her leg up, blocking the door.
MEGAN
Uh oh, what’s that? Somebody found
a souvenir.
JON
I’ve got to get back to my seat.
Could you move your leg please.
I’ve got to go.
Jon tries to move Megan’s leg out of the way.
MEGAN
You feel that steam heat coming?
That’s from my undercarriage. That
can go up and higher.

65.
Megan lets him pass and opens the bathroom door.
MEGAN (CONT’D)
Jon, get us a blanket. I’ve gotta
take a whiz and then I’ll be right
back. Cool.
As Jon escapes, he walks past a drunk Rita and Becca.
RITA
I don’t want you to be a big fuck
up like me.
BECCA
How do you think I feel?
RITA
You can still turn it around.
BECCA
Stop it! You’re more beautiful than
Cinderella. You smell like pine
needles and you have a face like
like sunshine.
INT. COACH SECTION - DAY
Annie is seated. The plane shakes a little. She looks past
the pregnant woman and out the window. Her eyes go WIDE.
INT. FIRST CLASS - CONTINUOUS
The flight attendant gets on the microphone.
FEMALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Ladies and gentlemen...As you can
see, the captain has turned on the
fasten-your-seat belt sign. It
seems we’ve found rough patch of
weather here-ANNIE (O.S.)
(over intercom)
I have an announcement too. There
is a colonial woman on the wing.
Lillian recognizes Annie's voice.
Oh, shit.

LILLIAN

Lillian jumps up and runs back to help Annie.
and draws his gun and a taser.

Jon jumps up

JON
ALL RIGHT, PEOPLE. EVERYONE REMAIN
CALM! I’M AN AIR MARSHAL.
He runs to the back of the plane.

Megan jumps up.

MEGAN
Yes! I knew it!! Holy shit, I knew
it! I got your back, Jon!
In the back of plane, all three flight attendants are
battling with Annie, who is still trying to yell into the
mic.
ANNIE
There is a colonial woman on the
wing. There is a woman on the wing,
I saw her. She is churning butter.
There’s something they’re not
telling us! She is out there right
now!
PREGNANT WOMAN
LET’S GET OUT! LET’S OPEN THE DOORS
AND GET OUT. SAY GOODBYE! WE’RE
GOING DOWN!
Lillian and the flight attendant grapple. Annie DUCKS away,
RUNS up the aisle, FAKES the Air Marshal out and climbs over
people to get to the other aisle and heads for first class,
passing the pregnant woman, who reaches for her.
PREGNANT WOMAN (CONT’D)
Where is this woman? Who is she?!
What does she want?!
Passengers get HYSTERICAL. Annie runs past Rita and Becca who
are now MAKING OUT, towards the bathroom.
Megan APPEARS from the galley and tackles her.
CUT TO:
INT. WYOMING TERMINAL - DAY
Annie and Lillian are being escorted off the plane in
handcuffs by the police and Air Marshal Jon. The unhappy
bridesmaids follow.

67.
INT. BUS - DAY
The bridesmaids are BUMMED.

Annie sits next to Lillian.

ANNIE
Let me make it up to you please.
I’m telling you, your shower is
going to be amazing. I have so many
ideas...
LILLIAN
I wanted to talk to you about
something. This has been very
overwhelming for you. It’s starting
to make you crazy.
ANNIE
Lill, I’m fine.
LILLIAN
No, you’re not fine Annie. We need
things to just flow smoothly from
now on and Helen knows how to do
this kind of stuff. She does it all
the time. She’s good at it and she
likes doing it. This way you don’t
have to plan any more lunches or
trips. You don’t have to do
anything you don’t want to do.
I get it.

ANNIE

LILLIAN
I think that it would be best for
here on out. For the shower, for
everything.
ANNIE
Whatever you want. That’s probably
best.
LILLIAN
I think so, right?
ANNIE
I just want you to be happy.
LILLIAN
I think that will make me happy.
Annie looks crushed.

68.
INT. ANNIE’S CAR - NIGHT
Annie drives home depressed. Up ahead, she sees Rhodes’ car
sitting on the side of the road in his usual spot. Annie
pulls up next to him.
ANNIE
Hi. Do you want to hang out?
INT. BAR - NIGHT
Rhodes and Annie are talking in the middle of a crowded bar.
ANNIE
It’s not funny. Have you ever been
kicked off a plane?
RHODES
I can’t say I have.
ANNIE
All of the girls hate me right now.
RHODES
So you’re like the maid of
dishonor.
ANNIE
I hope Lillian won’t be mad at me
too long.
RHODES
She’ll be alright.
ANNIE
I wish things were they way they
used to be. I feel like her life is
going off and getting perfect and
mine is just...
RHODES
It will turn around.
ANNIE
I’ve been hearing that for a long
time.
RHODES
It’s gonna turn around, I just know
it. You gotta bake...

69.
ANNIE
I don’t really do that anymore, I
told you.
Why?

RHODES

ANNIE
After it went under, I stopped. It
doesn’t make me happy anymore.
RHODES
Just because you didn’t make any
money doesn’t mean you failed at
it.
ANNIE
I lost a lot of money. All my
money.
RHODES
You’re so good at it.
ANNIE
Oh well, let’s change the subject.
No more baking, I’m done.
RHODES
I just don’t know how you can not
do it anymore. If I wasn’t a cop, I
would still go out with a gun and
shoot people.
(beat)
I probably wouldn’t do that.
(beat)
You’re ok, you know.
ANNIE
You don’t know me very well.
RHODES
I know you well enough to know that
you’re not so bad. You’ve got some
stuff. You’ve got bits and pieces
going on.
Thanks.

ANNIE

RHODES
I’ve been thinking about you a
little bit.

70.
ANNIE
About me? Really?
RHODES
There’s something about you...that
sticks.
INT. DARK APARTMENT - NIGHT
Annie and Rhodes fly through the door, making out.
ANNIE
Where’s the bedroom?
RHODES
I am so glad this is happening.
So am I.

ANNIE

INT. RHODES DUPLEX - MORNING
Annie wakes up. She looks like a disaster. She reacts when
she sees Rhodes sitting on the bed, staring at her.
He is in a t-shirt and shorts. Looks like a kid in love.
Annie instantly seems a little freaked out. It is a role
reversal of her relationship with Ted.
RHODES
Good morning.
ANNIE
Good morning.
RHODES
Sorry to freak you out. I haven’t
been sitting here that long.
ANNIE
Sorry, I guess I fell asleep, I
didn’t mean to sleep over.
RHODES
Don’t be silly.
(still smiling)
I made you a cappuccino.
ANNIE
You made it?

71.
RHODES
Last night was fun.
ANNIE
It was. Very fun.
Annie looks around the room. The place is modest, at best.
It is clean and organized, but it’s nothing like Ted’s
apartment. Rhodes stands up.
RHODES
Annie Walker, would you mind
following me into the kitchen? The
fun may continue...
(catching himself)
A different kind of fun. Why don’t
you get dressed though, I left your
clothes over there.
ANNIE
(smiling) Ok.
INT. RHODES’ KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
Rhodes walks in with a big smile, then turns to Annie. She
walks in and stops as Rhodes gestures grandly at something.
Annie looks surprised.
RHODES
There she is. Your workshop awaits.
ANNIE’S POV: The kitchen counter is laid out with mixing
bowls and baking pans and brand new ingredients like flour,
sugar, eggs, vanilla, butter, etc.
RHODES (CONT’D)
I know it’s a bit crazy, but I
popped out and got a few little
things. Bits and pieces--butter,
milk. I thought it would be fun for
us to bake together today.
Obviously you will be doing the
baking and I will be doing the
eating, because you are the expert.
He chuckles.

Annie stares at the ingredients in horror.

ANNIE
I know you went through all this
trouble but I don’t really want to--

72.
RHODES
Come on. I know you haven’t done it
a while, but it will be great.
Don’t be silly, just get into it.
You’re so good at it.
Annie is uncomfortable. She stares at him.
RHODES (CONT’D)
Alright I get it, it was a bit of a
curve ball.
ANNIE
I think I’m gonna go. Sorry.
Rhodes stares at her. It’s obvious he really cares about
her. She stares back at him, then heads for the door.
RHODES
Annie, I don’t know what you’re
getting so upset about.
ANNIE
Because you don’t know me. You
don’t know anything about me or my
life. I don’t know what you’re
trying to do here. I don’t need you
to fix me.
RHODES
To fix you?
ANNIE
I don’t need any help. Who do you
think you are?
RHODES
Jesus Annie, we had a really good
time and now you’re being all -ANNIE
It’s my fault. I shouldn’t have
come here last night. Last night
was a mistake.
Alright.

RHODES

ANNIE
I’m sorry. This was all a mistake.
It was all my fault.
She exits, slamming the door behind her.

Rhodes stares after

INT. ANNIE'S CAR - MORNING
Annie gets in her car, depressed and confused. She finds
Lillian's name on her phone and dials. She gets Lillian’s
voicemail.
ANNIE
Hey Lill, it’s me. I’m sure you’re
still probably a bit mad at me. I
hope not. Anyway, the excitement
continues with me. I just slept
with a cop that pulled me over and
woke up today with him. He was
really sweet, nice, and cute. So
naturally, I ran off as fast as I
could. What’s wrong with me? I know
you’re busy with stuff, so just
call me when yo get a chance. I’d
love to talk this out with you when
you can. Okay, bye.
INT. ANNIE'S APARTMENT - MORNING - A COUPLE OF WEEKS LATER
The clock reads 11 am. KNOCK at the door. Annie wakes up,
surprised that she slept this late. Brynn pops her head in.
BRYNN
Annie wake up, it’s 11 AM.
Oh, shit.

ANNIE

BRYNN
You got a package. I’d bring it to
you but you said ‘don’t touch my
things.’
She goes into the living room and sees a beautiful pink and
white striped box with her name and address in calligraphy
sitting on the table. When Annie opens the lid, “CANON IN D”
PLAYS and a real butterfly flies out. Inside the lid, it
reads, “A Shower for Lillian.”
In the box, there is a chocolate sculpture of Lillian and
Doug as Bride and Groom, a candle that has two wicks and says
on the outside “Lillian and Dougie. Twin Flames. An
Atmospheria Special Addition.” A stunned Annie takes a card
out that reads “A SHOWER FOR LILLIAN.” She opens it...

74.
HELEN (V.O.)
Please join us for a Parisian
brunch at the home of Helen Harris
III to celebrate the marriage of
Lillian Donovan and Douglas Price.
Let us “shower” Lillian with gifts
and love. Responde S’il Vous
Plait. Yay!
The butterfly lands on her face.
INT. CHOLODECKI’S - DAY
Annie stares at wedding rings in the counter.
GIRL (O.S.)
Excuse me!!
Annie looks up. A snotty 13 year old rich GIRL stands at
Annie’s counter with an iced coffee, chewing gum.
GIRL (CONT’D)
I’m looking for a birthday gift for
my best friend. I want to get her a
necklace that says ‘Best Friends
Forever.’
ANNIE
Are you sure you want it to say
forever?
(off the girl’s “duh”
face)
I don’t think you guys will be
together forever. No offense, but
the friends you have when you’re
younger, sometimes you grow apart.
You’ll get older and maybe she’ll
find a new best friend. And maybe
she’ll be more successful than you
are, and prettier, and richer, and
skinnier, and they end up doing
everything together.
GIRL
You’re weird.
ANNIE
I’m not weird.
GIRL
Yes you are.

75.
ANNIE
No I’m not. You started it.
GIRL
You started it. Did you forget to
take your Xanax this morning?
ANNIE
God, I feel bad for your parents.
GIRL
I feel bad for your face.
ANNIE
Call me when your boobs come in.
GIRL
You call me when yours come in.
ANNIE
What, do you have four boyfriends?
Exactly.

GIRL

ANNIE
Have fun having a baby at your
prom.
GIRL
You look like an old mop.
ANNIE
You know, you aren’t as popular as
you think you are.
GIRL
I’m very popular.
ANNIE
(miming a blow job)
I’m sure you are. Very popular.
GIRL
You’re an old single loser who is
never going to have any friends.
ANNIE
You’re a little cunt.

INT. DON’S OFFICE - DAY
Don stands across from Annie who finishes cleaning out her
locker. She sadly starts to leave.
ANNIE
Sorry. Let me tell my mom, okay?
DON
I already told her.
ANNIE
Was she mad?
Mmm-hmm.

DON

Don walks out, disappointed.
INT. ANNIE’S CAR - CONTINUOUS
She sits in her parked car listening to a message on her
cell.
RHODES (O.S.)
(on phone)
Hey Annie, its Rhodes again. Since
you aren’t returning any of my
calls I assume you aren’t
interested in spending any more
time with me, which is fine. So
don’t worry, I won’t be bothering
you ever again.
(beat)
Get those tail lights fixed.
Rhodes hangs up. Annie looks confused and torn, unsure if
she’s made the right decision about him or not.
INT. ANNIE’S BEDROOM - DAY
Brynn and Gil sit at the edge of Annie’s bed.
BRYNN
We’d like to invite you to no
longer live with us anymore.
ANNIE
What do you mean? I don’t get it.

77.
GIL
(tries to soften it)
We decided it’s a bit immature for
a grown up brother and sister to
still be living together with a
roommate at this age. We look a bit
silly don’t we?
Pathetic.

BRYNN

GIL
So we’re actually going to live
together alone. Without you.
BRYNN
You’re moving out.
Annie absorbs this.
BRYNN (CONT’D)
She’s not moving.
GIL
She will move, eventually.
BRYNN
(to Gil)
She has to.
(to Annie)
You have to go.
Brynn touches Annie’s leg to console her.
BRYNN (CONT’D)
Oh, that’s prickly.

Annie gets out of her loaded car.

Her mom meets her in the

ANNIE
Remember when you thought I hit
bottom? That wasn’t bottom.
MOM
Aw, come here. We’re going to have
fun. I, for one, am really glad
you’re here. And guess what just
came in today on the Netflix?
“Castaway.” Tom Hanks.

MOM (CONT'D)
It’s like Forrest Gump, but on an
island. You’re going to love it.
EXT. MILWAUKEE STREET - DAY
Annie stands outside the closed Cake Baby storefront. The
sign has been vandalized to read “Cock Baby.”
INT./EXT. ANNIE’S CAR - DAY
She drives past a stone column inscribed “The Harris House established 2006” and proceeds through two huge, wrought-iron
gates that lead to a beautiful, plantation-style, tree-lined
driveway. Her jaw drops.
AT THE NEXT STOP SIGN
A BUTLER appears with a tray.
BUTLER
Are you a guest of Helen Harris
III?
ANNIE
Yeah, I guess so.
BUTLER
The shower is over the second
bridge. Pink lemonade?
He hands her a crystal glass of pink lemonade with a large
orchid sticking out of it.
ANNIE
I don’t have a cup-holder.
But he has moved on to the next car. Annie struggles to
drive while holding the too-full glass. She is annoyed.
ANNIE (CONT’D)
(mumbling) Pink lemonade. Nice
touch.
She takes a sip.
ANNIE (CONT’D)
Goddamnit, that’s good. Shit, that
is fresh.
CUT TO:

79.
EXT. HELEN’S ESTATE - DAY
Annie arrives at the main house straddling a WHITE HORSE,
with a horseman leading her on foot. She struggles to
dismount. The horseman looks annoyed.
The front door is swung open by two attendants. As Annie
enters the mansion, groups of girls pass by her...
SHOWER GIRLS
This is the most beautiful shower
I’ve ever been to/Can you believe
this?/Did you see the party
favors?!/What a good friend ...
Helen’s house is ALL cream and white with gold. Couches are
puffy, art hangs everywhere. The house of a very rich person.
EXT. HELEN’S ESTATE - BACKYARD - DAY
Annie walks into the backyard and stops, her jaw dropping.
ANNIE’S POV: It’s all of the Paris shower ideas she told
Helen, but huge and over the top. Decorations to make it
look like France are everywhere. A TRIO WITH AN ACCORDION
PLAYER PLAYS FRENCH STANDARDS. LIVE SWANS and bunnies mill
about. Attendants in full French outfits ready to serve.
A giant cake shaped like the Eiffel Tower.
In the middle of everything stands an eight foot tall HEART
COOKIE that says “Lillian and Dougie!” in puffy pink cursive.
REVEAL a glorious four-tiered CHOCOLATE FOUNTAIN. Girls are
around it dipping in strawberries and smaller cookies,
laughing.
Annie takes it all in, shocked.
A waiter offers her champagne.
WAITER
(fake French accent)
Would you like some champagne?
It’s French.
ANNIE
Yeah, no kidding.
LILLIAN
Hey Annie, you’re here!

80.
ANNIE
Yeah, I’m here. I was invited,
right?
LILLIAN
No yeah, I just meant... you’re
here. Like you’ve arrived.
ANNIE
Well, here I am.
LILLIAN
Can you believe this? Isn’t this
amazing?
ANNIE
Yep. Yeah, it’s nice.
Awkward silence.
Are we ok?
Yes.

ANNIE (CONT’D)
LILLIAN

They both speak at the same time.
ANNIE
I didn’t want to bug you, but
I just...have so much to tell
you.
ANNIE
I totally understand.
LILLIAN
...you look great.
You too.

ANNIE

LILLIAN
So you’re cool?
Yup.

ANNIE

LILLIAN
And we’re cool?

LILLIAN
Sorry I haven’t called back.
I’ve been... swamped. Forgive
me, there’s just lots of
organizing and-

81.
ANNIE
Super cool. We’ll talk later
though, right?
For sure.

LILLIAN

Awkward silence.
LILLIAN (CONT’D)
OK, great. I have to say hi to my
aunt or she’ll get mad at my mom.
Lillian runs off. Annie watches her go, frustrated by the
brief encounter. She stands there alone.
INT. HELEN’S GREAT ROOM - LATER
Lillian is opening presents.
beautiful towels.

She opens a box filled with

LILLIAN
Rita, you got all our towels?
RITA
Love you, kid.
Rita takes a picture. Lillian then grabs a gift, obviously
from Annie. It’s quirky, homemade, tons of bows. Doesn’t
look like the others.
LILLIAN
I know who this is from, I can tell
by the wrapping.
Lillian unwraps it, smiling. Inside is...
LILLIAN (CONT’D)
Awww. It’s us, Annie. It’s a box of
all my favorite things from stores
I love in Milwaukee. This is so
unbelievable.
(pulling out a CD, beams)
Wilson Phillips?
MEGAN
I love Wilson Phillips.
LILLIAN
We listened to “Hold On” probably
10,000 times when I got my driver’s
license. This is such an amazing
gift, thank you.

82.
They share a moment. Annie looks pleased, throwing a smug
look at Helen. Shrugs like “it was nothing.” Helen looks a
bit self-conscious.
HELEN
Now I feel bad. I’ve been so busy
putting the shower together that
all I did was get you a card.
Helen hands her an envelope.
LILLIAN
Helen, you threw me this shower.
That’s more than enough.
Lillian opens the card and reads it.
with Annie. Then, in shock ...
Oh my god.

Helen exchanges a look

LILLIAN (CONT’D)
Helen.

LAURIE
Honey, what is it?
LILLIAN
Helen’s taking me to Paris.
HELEN
Ha ha! Got you!
(then)
Just a little pre-wedding vacation.
And while we’re there, we’re going
to meet your wedding dress designer
and have a fitting!
LILLIAN
Paris? YOU GOT ME A TRIP TO
PARIS?!!!
Lillian jumps up and down, then grabs Helen and hugs her
tightly. Annie watches them, then something (finally) snaps.
ANNIE
Are you fucking kidding me?
Annie?

JUDY

ANNIE
MOTHERFUCKING PARIS?!
LILLIAN
Annie, what are you doing?

83.
ANNIE
(to Helen)
I told you she wanted to go to
Paris. I told you Paris! I told you
about ALL this stuff!
LILLIAN
Annie, calm down.
ANNIE
No! What, you’re going to go to
Paris with Helen now?! Are you
going to ride around on bikes with
berets and fucking baguettes in the
basket of the front of your bikes?
How romantic! What woman gives
another woman a trip to Paris? Am I
right? Lesbian! We’re all thinking
it aren’t we?
Rita and Becca are uncomfortable.
I’m not.
I was.

BECCA
MEGAN

ANNIE
Yes, we’re all thinking it. Right?
Annie.

LILLIAN

ANNIE
Lillian this is not the ‘you’ I
know. The ‘you’ that I know, would
have walked in here and rolled your
eyes and thought this was
completely over the top,
ridiculous, and stupid. Look at
this shower! LOOK at that fucking
COOKIE!! Did you really think this
group of women would finish that
cookie? Hey, you know what!? That
reminds me, I don’t think I ever
got a piece!
Annie storms outside. She takes swings at the cookie,
punching it.
ANNIE (CONT’D)
Stupid fucking cookie!

84.
She rips off a large hunk, shoves it in her mouth.
ANNIE (CONT’D)
Oooh, delicious! Ooo! Maybe it’s
better if I dip it in the
CHOCOLATE!!
She tries to take the cookie off its stand to carry it. It’s
too huge. She falls backwards and the cookie falls on top of
her. Annie punches her fist up through the cookie and
struggles awkwardly to get out from under it.
She storms over to the chocolate fountain and tries to tip it
over. It’s way too heavy. She starts to empty the HOT
chocolate with her hands onto the ground.
ANNIE (CONT’D)
(as she scoops)
Is this what you want Lillian!?
Nothing says friendship like 1,000
gallons of unsanitary chocolate!
(still scooping)
Ow, ow, ow! Oh, god, it’s so hot.
Everyone is watching Annie. She is fighting and punching the
air like a crazy person, chasing a swan. A little girl
starts crying. Lillian storms outside seething.
LILLIAN
Annie, what are you doing? What is
going on?!
ANNIE
What am I doing? You wouldn’t know.
Where have you been?! You would
have no idea. Well, let me fill you
in. Ever since you got engaged,
everything has turned to shit.
LILLIAN
This is supposed to be my time. You
have managed to ruin every event in
my wedding, thank you very much.
ANNIE
Thank you very much.
(pointing to Helen)
It’s all her fault. It’s not mine.
You would know that if you got your
beautiful-haired-head out of your
asshole. In fact, out of her
asshole! WHICH I’M SURE IS
PERFECTLY BLEACHED!

85.
LILLIAN
IT IS! You know how I know? Because
I went to the fucking salon with
her and I GOT MY ASSHOLE BLEACHED
TOO! And I LOVE my new asshole! Why
can’t you just be happy for me and
then go home and talk behind my
back like a normal person!
ANNIE
I am happy for you, Lillian. I am
very happy for you. I wish you well
and I won’t bother you anymore.
LILLIAN
Are you kidding me? Annie!
Annie storms off back through the house, her hands and
forearms completely covered in chocolate. Lillian soon
follows.
Annie walks fast through the lobby. On her way out the door,
the DOORMAN offers her the party favor. A PUPPY.
DOORMAN
Party favor?
LILLIAN
No, no! She does not get a party
favor. She does not get a dog!
Annie walks out. Lillian follows her, upset.
LILLIAN (CONT’D)
And if you’re going to act like
this, don’t even bother coming to
my wedding.
Annie looks at her, and then is gone. This hangs in the air.
Lillian turns to sees all the women standing behind Helen.
HELEN
I’m proud of you, Lill.
LILLIAN
Shut up, Helen. Anyone else have
anything they want to share today?
No one says anything, then ... Megan’s hand shoots up.
MEGAN
I took two dogs already!

They’re

INT. ANNIE’S CAR - DAY
Annie is pissed, driving down the highway. She looks over as
MEGAN’S VAN SPEEDS PAST HER, PACKED WITH DOGS who are looking
out the windows, sitting on her lap, laying on the dashboard.
As she stares at the van, a PORCUPINE crosses the road in
front of her. She slams on her brakes to avoid hitting it
and BOOM! Annie is rear-ended, hard. The driver behind her
then backs up, peels out and drives away.
ANNIE
(yelling after car)
Hit and run, CLASSY! This is
perfect!
WHIR-WHIR-WHIR. Her car won’t start. She puts her forehead
on the steering wheel, at her wit’s end.
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
Rhodes is looking at the damage. He's distant but dutiful.

I know.
RHODES
And now here we are.
ANNIE
Look I’ve had a horrible day, I
don’t need a lecture from you right
now. Helen just -RHODES
This didn’t happen because of
Helen. This happened because you
didn’t get your tail lights fixed.
Pretty simple.
(suddenly losing it)
DO YOU KNOW HOW CRAZY THAT MAKES
ME?! SEEING YOU DRIVING PAST NIGHT
AFTER NIGHT AND YOU STILL HAVEN’T
GOTTEN THOSE FUCKING LIGHTS FIXED?!
DO YOU KNOW HOW FRUSTRATING THAT
IS?! THERE WAS A SIMPLE SOLUTION
AND YOU DIDN’T DO IT!!
(MORE)

87.
RHODES (CONT'D)
Your problem Annie, is that you
just don’t understand that you
could hurt people...with these
broken lights. Don’t you see how
irresponsible that is?
ANNIE
Yes, I should have gotten my
taillights fixed, but I didn’t.
RHODES
Don’t worry about it. Seriously,
your message was received.
Annie is speechless.
ANNIE
Please, I don’t know what’s going
on with me right now -RHODES
It’s fine, don’t bother. What is
done is done.
ANNIE
Look, I’m just in a weird place
right now. You were so nice and I
feel like you-RHODES
Like I said, don't bother.

He turns and starts walking toward his car. Annie is stunned.
ANNIE
So, what, that's it?
RHODES
Yes, that’s how it works.
Come on --

ANNIE

RHODES
For the record Annie, you flirted
with me. You made me feel like you
really liked me. Which is really
unfair. Then you came home with me
and we did stuff, fun stuff, and
then you left like it was nothing.

88.
ANNIE
Oh please, I know how guys do this
thing, how they act. One minute it
means something the next minute it
doesn't.
RHODES
Right, you got it all figured out.
How’s that working out for you,
pretty good?
Rhodes stops and turns to look at her, unsure.
TED screeches up in his Porsche.
TED
Boom. What’s up fuck buddy? You
called for some roadside
assistance?
Rhodes’ face drops.
TED (CONT’D)
Thanks officer, I can take it from
here.
Come on!

RHODES

ANNIE
I didn't have anyone else to call!
I didn’t know you were going to
show up.
RHODES
That’s the problem with cops Annie,
we’re never there when you need us.
Rhodes gets into his car, drives off.
TED
That cop talks weird.
Annie looks defeated, then SIGHS.
TED (CONT’D)
Come on Dingus. Tic-tock, I have
shit to do.
She sadly gets into Ted's car.

INT. TED'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER
ANNIE
Thanks for picking me up.
TED
Not a problem.
ANNIE
Were you busy?
TED
Well, it is Friday. You look tired.
If you’re tired you can totally lay
down in my lap, if you want.
What?

ANNIE

TED
Just take a little lap nap. If you
want.
(pointing)
Open for biz.
Annie looks at him, thinking.

Then ...

ANNIE
Can you please pull over?
TED
That’s an even better idea.
ANNIE
No, just please stop the car. I
want to get out.
TED
No, it’s super gravelly.
ANNIE
Please pull over!
Why?

TED

ANNIE
(looking at him)
I just realized I would rather get
murdered out here than spend the
next half hour with you. Now,
please stop the car.

90.
TED
Annie, it’s called humor, learn
about it. Besides, I would never
last a half hour.
Ted pulls over.

Annie gets out, grabbing her purse.

She closes the door, straightens her sweater, and heads off
down the shoulder of the road. He drives beside her.
TED (CONT’D)
You used me!
(As she walks away)
Fine, you’re no longer my number
three!
INT. JUDY’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Annie sits on the couch waiting Castaway. It’s the tearjerking scene when Wilson the volleyball is floating away
from Tom Hanks. He’s losing his friend. Annie is sobbing.
The DOORBELL rings. Annie opens the door. MEGAN is standing
there with 7 PUPPIES from Helen’s shower on leashes.
MEGAN
I’m coming in.
Megan barges into the house with the dogs leading the way.

she sits on the couch with Annie.
MEGAN
Heel. Heel.
ANNIE
How many did you take?
MEGAN
Oh. Uh, I took nine. I
overcommitted with this whole dog
thing. I’d probably be more
comfortable with six. It’s a lot of
energy to deal with. But you
wouldn't know that because you
haven't been returning my calls.

Then

91.
ANNIE
And say what? Hi, I can’t get off
the couch. I got fired from my job,
I got kicked out of my apartment, I
can’t pay any of my bills, my car
is a piece of shit, I don’t have
any friends -Megan stands up and starts pacing then gets in Annie’s face.
MEGAN
You know what I find interesting
about that Annie? It’s interesting
to me that you have absolutely no
friends. Do you know why that’s
interesting? Here’s a friend
standing directly in front of you
trying to talk to you and you
choose to talk about having no
friends.
ANNIE
You know what I mean.
MEGAN
You know what I think?
She pokes Annie.

Then continues to prod and push her as she

MEGAN (CONT’D)
You don't want help. You want a
pity party.
ANNIE
No, I don't. Stop it.
MEGAN
You're an asshole Annie.
Megan shoves Annie.
ANNIE
Ow. What are you doing?
MEGAN
What? Am I bothering you? I’m
life. Life bothering you? Life's
hard, huh? Life can push you
around. I'm your life. You’re
gonna let life bite you on the ass?
Then Megan sits on top of Annie and holds her arms.

92.
MEGAN (CONT’D)
I’m trying to get you to fight for
your shitty life and you won’t do
it. I’m your shitty life Annie.
Annie SMACKS Megan hard in the face.
ANNIE
Oh my god, I’m sorry.
Megan looks like she might get mad, but then she smiles.
MEGAN
I’m not. Nice hit. I’m glad to see
you’ve got a little bit of spark in
you. I knew that Annie was in there
somewhere.
(then)
I think you’re ready to hear a
little story about a girl named
Megan who didn’t have a very good
time in high school. I’m referring
to myself when I say Megan, it’s me
Megan. I know you look at me now
and think, boy she must have
breezed through high school. Not
the case Annie. This was not easy
going up and down the halls with.
They used to try to blow me up.
People used to throw firecrackers
on my head in high school.
Firecrackers, literally, not
figuratively. They called me a
freak. Do you think I let that
stop me? Do you think I went home
crying to my mommy, "Oh, I don't
have any friends." I did not. You
know what I did? I pulled myself
up, I studied hard, I read every
book in the library and now I work
for the government and have the
highest possible security
clearance. Don’t repeat that. I
cannot protect you. I know where
all the nukes are and I know the
codes.
ANNIE
I won’t say anything.
MEGAN
You would be amazed, a lot of
shopping malls. Don’t repeat that.

93.

I won’t.

ANNIE

MEGAN
I have six houses. I bought an
eighteen wheeler just cause I
could. You lost Lillian. You got
another best friend sitting right
in front of you if you’d notice.
You need to stop feeling sorry for
yourself. I do not associate with
people that blame the world for
their problems cause you’re your
problem Annie, and you’re also your
solution. You get that?
This hits Annie.

Annie's speechless.

Megan exhales, winded.

ANNIE
Yes. I just miss her I guess.
MEGAN
I know you do, I know you do. Come
on, bring it in.
They hug.
MEGAN (CONT’D)
There’s the Annie I knew was there.
(smelling her hair)
Oh Annie, wash your hair. You’ve
got to wash your hair.

Judy sits reading an ancient magazine in the waiting area.

Wow, it looks fantastic.
BILL
Rhodes and I worked a deal out way

Are you serious?
Annie sees something warm in him, sparks an idea.
over and grabs her mom. Drags her over.

She walks

ANNIE (CONT’D)
This is my mom, Judy.
Annie motions for her mom to talk to Bill, then leaves.
JUDY
(looks at Bill, then)
Wait, don’t I know you from AA?

BILL
Oh my gosh, you made that artichoke
dip didn’t you. It was just
delicious.
They smile a each other.

117

Happy.

EXT. RHODES DUPLEX - DAY
Annie puts a cake box on the stoop in front of Rhodes’ front
door. She looks pleased, then rings the doorbell and runs
back to her car. She ducks down.
Rhodes opens the front door and looks down. It’s a cake
shaped like a carrot that says “I’m Sorry.” He stares at it
as Annie watches. Then, he heads back into the house and
closes the door, leaving the cake out there.
Annie deflated. Heartbroken, she drives away.
EXT. RHODES DUPLEX - NIGHT
Annie drives past Rhodes’ place. She sees the cake still
sitting on the stoop, then continues on sadly.

95.
EXT. RHODES DUPLEX - DAY
Annie drives past the house AGAIN. The cake is being eaten
by RACCOONS, still sitting in the same place on the stoop.
It hits her...she’s lost him.
INT. JUDY’S HOUSE - MORNING
Annie is sleeping. Judy enters in her bathrobe.
JUDY
Are you sure you’re not gonna come
with me today? It’s Lillian’s big
day.
ANNIE
Mom, she doesn’t want me there.
JUDY
Okay. I’ll fix you a tuna fish
sandwich.
ANNIE
It’s eight in the morning.
JUDY
You can put syrup on it.
INT. JUDY’S HOUSE - SOME TIME LATER
DING DONG. Annie answers the door in her clothes. It’s
HELEN. She starts to close the door, Helen stops her.
I know.

HELEN

ANNIE
What do you want?
HELEN
(strangely calm)
I was wondering if you knew where
Lillian was?
ANNIE
What do you mean?
HELEN
She disappeared after the Rehearsal
dinner last night. I can’t find
her, we looked everywhere.

96.

What?

ANNIE

HELEN
She’s missing. Can you help?

A123

ANNIE
(suddenly concerned)
Wait here. I think I know someone
that could help. I’ll get my keys.

A123

INT. ANNIE’S CAR - DAY
Helen and Annie are driving.

It is beyond awkward.

HELEN
I just don’t know what could have
possibly gone wrong. Everything was
going smoothly. The dress looked
fantastic, it had come in from
Paris. Dougie was being great and
very helpful. I had organized
everything to the last final
detail. I just don’t know what
happened to her.
ANNIE
I don’t know. You should know,
right? You’re her best friend. It’s
weird that you don’t know, you guys
are so close.
HELEN
Annie I want to apologize to you,
personally, for all the things that
have gone down. I know I hurt you
and that I created a distance
between you and Lillian and I want
to apologize for that and
everything that happened at the
shower, with Las Vegas -ANNIE
Okay, I don’t want to hear anymore
honestly. I just don’t want to talk
to you.
As Helen starts to talk, her face is starting to get red and
her eyes are welling up. She fights to remain completely
composed.

97.
HELEN
Perry never wants to talk to me
either. He travels a lot, like all
year. I’m basically just by myself.
ANNIE
I don’t feel sorry for you.
HELEN
You know I really liked that
original dress you picked at the
bridal store. I thought it was
beautiful, you have really lovely
taste.
ANNIE
Thanks. But it’s a little too late
for that.
Helen’s hands and body contort and her face gets redder and
sweatier.
HELEN
And I don’t think that Brazilian
food really gave us food poisoning.
No it did.

ANNIE

HELEN
No, I don’t think it did.
ANNIE
It was the food. I shit my pants.
HELEN
I don’t think that was your fault.
ANNIE
No, that was my fault.
HELEN
I think people only ask me to do
their weddings because I’m good at
organizing parties.
Helen is now beet red and looks almost like she’s in pain as
she fights with every muscle in her body to remain composed.
Annie looks disturbed.
HELEN (CONT’D)
I don’t have any female friends.
Helen is now crying, and not pretty. Annie cracks a smile.

98.
HELEN (CONT’D)
Why are you smiling?
ANNIE
This is the first time I’ve seen
you look ugly. It makes me kind of
happy.
HELEN
I look ugly?
(laughing and crying)
No I don’t. I don’t really look
ugly.
ANNIE
You’re an ugly crier, but that’s
okay.
HELEN
Well, I’m not really an ugly crier.
ANNIE
Maybe just a little bit.
HELEN
I ruined my makeup. I still look
pretty right?
EXT. ROAD - DAY
Rhodes sits in his car at his post, reading a newspaper.
Annie’s car pulls up next to him.
ANNIE
(yelling over Helen)
Rhodes! Rhodes.
Rhodes starts to roll up his window.
HELEN
He’s ignoring you.
(to Rhodes)
Officer! Roll down your window!
Excuse me! Please!
ANNIE
Rhodes, I know you can hear me and
I know you’re mad at me. But I need
your help, please.
Rhodes lifts a sandwich to his mouth and takes a casual bite.
Flips to the next page of the paper. Icing Annie.

99.
HELEN
You know this guy?
Annie stares at him, thinking, then drives away.
EXT. ROAD - CONTINUOUS
Annie’s car SPEEDS past Rhodes. He takes another bite of his
sandwich, ignoring her. Helen is scared.
HELEN
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!
ANNIE
Just trying to get his attention.
Annie looks back and turns the car around. She’s gonna try
again. This time she honks the horn and flashes her
headlights, speeding past even faster. Rhodes folds his
paper into a square and prepares to do the crossword. Annie
turns around again. She screeches to a stop.
EXT. ROAD - CONTINUOUS
She speeds by Rhodes again, this time swerving all over the
road. She yells to him...
ANNIE
I’m speeding! You better pull me
over!!
Rhodes REALLY wants to, but instead takes out a pen and
starts doing the crossword.
Really.

RHODES

Annie speeds by again and again, throwing a bunch of TRASH
and DIET COKE CANS out of the window, blaring music, drinking
a 40 oz., doing a donut in the middle of the road, burning
rubber, sending up a cloud of smoke. He fights to continue
ignoring her.
She finally pulls up behind him and taps the back of his car.
Rhodes sets down his crossword and turns on his flashing
lights. Makes the siren give one small sad BLOOP. Then
quickly gets out of his car.
RHODES (CONT’D)
Are you crazy? All that stuff, that
would have been dangerous for a
good driver.

100.
ANNIE
I’m sorry. I need your help. We
can’t find Lillian.
RHODES
How long has she been gone?
ANNIE
She’s been missing for like twelve
hours.
RHODES
Twelve hours? It’s not a missing
person until it’s at least twenty
four hours. Have you ever seen CSI?
Twenty four hours. Let me get on
with my job Annie.
ANNIE
(sincere)
Nathan...please. I really need your
help.
HELEN
Please Nathan.
RHODES
Who’s this one?
ANNIE
(hesitates)
This is Helen.
Rhodes is immediately speechless.
RHODES
Hello Helen, I’ve heard wonderful
things.
EXT. RHODES’ CAR - MOMENTS LATER
Rhodes is on his phone as he types on the car’s computer.
Annie and Helen stand, watching.
RHODES
(into phone)
Uh huh. Uh huh. Okay, thanks.
(then)
We’ve traced her cell phone to the
corner of Craner and Rose. Do you
know where that is?

101.
The girls are quiet and perplexed, talking softly to each
other.
ANNIE
(to Helen)
That’s her apartment. I thought
you said you looked there.
We did.

HELEN
Last night.

RHODES
So you’re saying she’s at her
apartment? That’s what you’re
telling me?
ANNIE
She must have gone back after you
left.
RHODES
God, that was crazy of her.
HELEN
Thank god, thank you. Let’s go,
Let’s go.
ANNIE
(to Rhodes)
We found her! I’m so sorry, I
didn't mean to waste your time.
That’s embarrassing. Thank you.
RHODES
(underwhelmed)
No, you’re welcome. This is the
kind of high-octane stuff that made
me want to be a cop. Missing girl
found at her apartment. It’s
adrenaline pinching.
ANNIE
...It’s nice to see you.
RHODES
I’m glad that you got your tail
lights fixed. Means I won’t have to
stop you again.
Annie reads between the lines.
HELEN
Annie, let’s go!

It’s over.

102.
RHODES
Anyway, go and save your friend
from her apartment.
He sits in his car. Annie looks like she wants to say more
but can’t. She gets in her car, then drives away. Helen
looks at Annie, then out the back window at Rhodes.
HELEN’S POV: Rhodes stares after them, looking bummed.
EXT. LILLIAN’S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
Annie’s car pulls up in front of Lillian’s apartment
building. Her car is there! They start to jump out.
ANNIE
Do you mind if I actually go by
myself?
Helen understands and nicely nods.

She gets it.

INT. LILLIAN’S APARTMENT - DAY
Annie, with her own key, unlocks the door, and walks into the
apartment. It’s quiet.
Lillian?

ANNIE
Lill?!

After a beat, she hears a small GROAN. Annie walks in and
sees the outline of Lillian in bed. She’s completely covered
from head to toe by her comforter.
Lill?
Go away.

ANNIE (CONT’D)
LILLIAN

Annie sits on the bed and pulls the covers off of Lillian’s
face.
ANNIE
What happened?
Lillian has been crying, and continues to.
LILLIAN
This whole wedding is fucked up.
Helen took over everything.
Everything’s gotten out of control.
My dad can’t afford the wedding.
(MORE)

103.
LILLIAN (CONT'D)
(beat)
This has been really hard to do
without you. It’s been shitty.
I’m sorry.

ANNIE

LILLIAN
Nope, I’m sorry. I’m sorry I kicked
you out of my wedding. It’s my
fault.
ANNIE
No it’s my fault.
(beat)
I think I’m the one with the mental
problems.
LILLIAN
Yeah, wasn’t it my turn to be
crazy? The bride is supposed to be
crazy.
ANNIE
Yes, technically.
LILLIAN
You kind of stole all the crazy.
ANNIE
I out-crazied you. Everything is
going to be okay.
LILLIAN
How do you know that? At the
rehearsal dinner last night I told
Dougie I had to get Q-Tips and all
of a sudden I was driving here. I
came here. I realize this is the
last time I’m going to be here.
With that couch and this bed.
Taking a bath in my bathtub. You
know how much I love my bathtub.
ANNIE
(humoring her kindly)
It’s a good tub. I slept in there
on my 30th birthday.
LILLIAN
I remember. Everything is going to
change.
(tearfully)
(MORE)

104.
LILLIAN (CONT'D)
I’m not going to get to live five
minutes away from you. That makes
me so sad.
Annie soaks this in, and although sad, sees this is her time
to be there for Lillian.
ANNIE
Don’t be sad. Things are going to
change, but they’ll be better.
You’re gonna take this huge, great,
beautiful step. And Dougie loves
you more than anything and so do I.
LILLIAN
But what about you? What’s going to
happen to you?
Annie realizes she’s going to be okay.
ANNIE
I’ll be fine. Don’t worry. I am
fine. Besides, you need to blaze
the trail for me and then report
back and tell me what’s coming.
LILLIAN
Whatever you say, boss.
They smile and hug.
ANNIE
C’mon, put on your dress and let’s
go to your wedding.
LILLIAN
Mmm. That’s the other problem.
CUT TO:
INT. LILLIAN’S APARTMENT - SAME
Lillian entering in THE MOST OVER-THE-TOP COUTURE WEDDING
DRESS EVER IMAGINED. Annie IMMEDIATLEY starts to laugh.
LILLIAN
Don’t you dare laugh.
Annie cracks up. Lillian joins her. It’s RIDICULOUS.
LILLIAN (CONT’D)
I cannot wear this dress.

105.
ANNIE
Don’t panic. Lill, we’ll fix it.
We’ll tweak it. I will not let you
walk down that aisle unless you
look perfect and beautiful, I
promise.
LILLIAN
Do you have a chain saw? And a blow
torch? I think this whole wedding
is going to be a disaster.
ANNIE
Don’t say that. If Helen had
anything to do with this wedding it
is going to be perfect and
tasteful.
Lillian nods and gives Annie a grateful smile.
happy to be friends again.

They’re both

EXT. OUTDOOR WEDDING - NIGHT
DRAMATIC LIGHTING AND MUSIC. A minister is giving the vows
to Lillian and Dougie in front of a wall of fog.
MINISTER
Do you, Douglas Anthony Hastings,
take Lillian ...
As the minister continues, PULL BACK to see the bridesmaids
and groomsmen are standing on ornate platforms that are
sticking up out of a reflecting pool. Megan has one of her
dogs on a leash. It has a ring bearer’s pillow on it’s back
and wears a dog tuxedo.
I do.

DOUGIE

MINISTER
And do you, Lillian Grace Donovan,
take Douglas ...
I do.

LILLIAN

PULL BACK MORE to see that Lillian and Dougie are actually
standing ON THE WATER as a laser light show is spelling out
“THEY DO” inside a beating heart on the fog behind them.

106.
MINISTER
By the powers invested in me, I now
declare you man and wife. You may
now kiss the bride.
Lillian and Dougie kiss. BOOM! FIREWORKS start to go off as
the LASER LIGHT SHOW goes into overdrive. It’s nuts.
Lillian looks over at Annie. They exchange a smile that
says, “We were wrong. This is crazy.”
Helen is looking around at it all, beaming. She couldn’t be
happier. Once again she pulls a mic out of no where.
HELEN
And now ladies and gentlemen, here
with us tonight is Lillian’s
favorite band, playing her favorite
song. Put it together for Wilson
Phillips!
WILSON PHILLIPS walks out singing. As fireworks continue and
MUSIC starts ... Annie is floored.
ANNIE
(to Helen)
Really?
A133

HELEN
This is the last one, I promise.

A133

Megan looks into the crowd, winking. JON the Air Marshal
winks back!
EXT. WEDDING RECEPTION - HUNT CLUB - NIGHT
The doors fly open. The bride and groom run down the stairs
everyone is throwing flower petals and cheering. They say
goodbye to people, hug etc. Lill hugs Helen and thanks her.
Before she gets in the car she looks for someone. It’s Annie,
who couldn’t get close to the front. They find each other,
share a smile, Lillian mouths “Thank You,” and waves goodbye.
Annie watches as the car drives away. Lillian’s gone.
Megan comes up next to Annie laughing.
ANNIE
What’s so funny?
MEGAN
I put a loaded gun in Dougie’s
carry on. TSA is gonna rip his ass
apart.

107.
EXT. HUNT CLUB PARKING LOT - NIGHT
Annie and Helen are saying goodbye.
HELEN
Did you have a nice evening?
ANNIE
It was beautiful, yes.
HELEN
What did you think of the wedding?
ANNIE
It was great.
HELEN
It was great, right?
ANNIE
It was perfect.
Helen is relieved, followed by an awkward pause.
HELEN
It was really nice meeting you.
ANNIE
Helen, it was really nice meeting
you too.
(beat)
Hey maybe one night the three of us
can go to Rockin’ Sushi together.
HELEN
Thank you Annie, I would love that.
Helen’s eyes light up, touched.
parking lot, then smiles.

She then glances out to the

HELEN (CONT’D)
(then)
Annie, your ride is here.
Annie looks out, happiness comes over her. Reveal Officer
Rhodes standing next to his squad car, like Jake Ryan in
‘Sixteen Candles’. Annie gives Helen a look of “How?” Helen
just smiles and nods for Annie to head over. She does.
RHODES
How did it all work out?
ANNIE
Strangely well.

108.
RHODES
Good.
(beat)
I ate your cake that you left.
You did?

ANNIE

RHODES
Yup. I had to fight some raccoons
off but that’s okay. I’m pretty
strong and tough so it wasn’t much
of a contest. I’m just gonna kiss
you now rather than -They kiss.
POLICE RADIO (O.S.)
Officer Rhodes, please report to
North Brook Street -RHODES
Whoops. I’m on duty. And I need to
put my uniform on. If I drive like
this, they’re going to think I
stole the car. Care to ride along?
ANNIE
Sure, alright.
Annie walks around the car and starts to get into the front
passenger seat.
RHODES
Where you goin? You’ll have to sit
in the back seat. Yeah, it’s
against regulation for you to sit
in the front.
What?!

ANNIE

Rhodes opens the car’s BACK door for her.
ANNIE (CONT’D)
You’re gonna make me sit in the
back seat?
RHODES
Yes, c’mon.
She goes around to the other side and as she’s getting in
Rhodes pushes her head down like she’s under arrest.

109.
RHODES (CONT’D)
Sorry, force of habit.
He closes the door and jumps in the driver’s seat. As the
car pulls away we continue to hear their conversation.
ANNIE (O.S.)
Can I please get in the front seat?
RHODES (O.S.)
Actually I’m afraid there is a
warrant out for your arrest.
ANNIE (O.S.)
What!? Why?
RHODES (O.S.)
Reckless driving, littering,
texting, consuming alcohol while
operating a vehicle. You didn’t
think I was gonna let you get away
with that, did you?
ANNIE (O.S.)
Can you at least put the siren on?
Rhodes flips on the siren as they drive off.
ANNIE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
(smiling)
Thank you.
THE END
