OPENING CREDITS MONTAGE
EXT. HOTEL ENTRANCE - NIGHT
MONSTERS and HUMANS in formal wear pour into the lobby...
MUSIC:

DADDY’S GIRL (ROCK VERSION)

PHOTO TABLEAU - Johnny in tuxedo posing with his USHERS,
including his straightlaced athletic brothers BRETT and KENT,
and several odd MONSTERS. His Backpack is the best man,
wearing a bowtie. FLASH EFFECT to STILL PHOTO of the group.

ec
io

PHOTO TABLEAU - Mavis in wedding gown posing with her
BRIDESMAIDS, including CLARABELLE, a monster with frog limbs,
KELSEY, an 8 foot tall slimy MONSTER with sharp HORNS for
arms, and two redheaded SISTERS of Johnny, all in matching
shiny purple bridesmaid dresses. Her MAID OF HONOR is the
SHRUNKEN HEAD, strung to a coathanger with a bridesmaid
dress, hung on a small coat rack. The Sisters look
uncomfortable. FLASH EFFECT to STILL PHOTO of the group.
Mavis is invisible.

Ab

e

R

PHOTO TABLEAU - Johnny and Mavis together, Johnny is flanked
by his polite but stiff family, including his brothers,
sisters, MIKE, his crewcut Dad, and LINDA, his chatty,
redhead housewifey mom. Mavis is flanked by a nervous
Dracula. She fixes his hair for him and he gives a tense,
wooden smile. FLASH EFFECT to STILL PHOTO - Drac and Mavis
are invisible.
INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - LATER
Johnny at the alter with his backpack next to him, holding
the ring. Coming up the aisle are BRETT and KELSEY. She makes
eye contact with a MONSTER GIRLFRIEND in the audience and
rolls her eyes toward Brett like “I can’t believe I’m paired
with this loser”. A trail of slime follows her on the aisle.
A redhaired HUMAN FLOWER GIRL carries a bouquet of flowers as
Monsters and s alike say “Awwww.” Then a slew of wolf pups
pounce on the flowers in a whirlwind, shredding them, leaving
the girl disheveled as petals fall around her. The Humans
are stunned but the Monsters again say “Awwww.”
Johnny and Mavis at the alter, married. Dracula is teary eyed
as he looks at Mavis and remembers her as a child. Johnny
and Mavis slowly move in for the big kiss...Dracula tries but
can’t take it and, using telepathy from his hand, flies the
Shrunken Head in between them just as Johnny kisses her.

Johnny opens his eyes and recoils as Dracula apologizes,
indicating “Okay, one quick one” and they KISS quickly.
RECEIVING LINE - A touchy feely PRICKLY MONSTER hugs Johnny’s
Dad Mike, causing him to cringe in agony. The emotional BLOB
hugs his wife Linda so hard she is pulled into his body. Her
sons try to politely pull her out.
RECEPTION - MARTY (the “you look pale as well” monster)
giving a heartfelt, poetic, completely unintelligible speech.
Shots of Mavis, Drac, and various MONSTERS extremely moved.
Shots of Johnny’s straight laced human PARENTS and BROTHERS
mystified. Marty finishes to applause and hands the mic to
the Backpack. After a silent beat its bow tie falls off and
we see Johnny nodding and choking up.

ec
io

JOHNNY
True. So true, buddy.

R

Mavis with Johnny cutting the WEDDING CAKE. The cake screams
in horror a la scream cheese as it gets cut. All the monsters
applaud. Johnny’s family smiles uncomfortably as they are
served cake. As one brother reaches for his, the VENUS FLY
TRAP CENTERPIECE devours it, taking his watch and his arm as
well. Mavis struggles to pull him out and shoots a look at
the Venus Flytrap, who tries to act like he was just kidding.

Ab

e

PULL OUT from clock reading 5:30 am...Drac, Frank, Griffin,
Wayne, and Murray have taken over for the band of ZOMBIE
COMPOSERS, who watch as they drunkenly try to finish the song
we’ve been hearing through the montage. Johnny, also drunk,
sings with Dracula as the MONSTERS in the crowd go wild. The
HUMANS are all exhausted from the late hour. Johnny’s dad Mike
sleeps at his table. The GHOST TABLECLOTHS go nuts, suddenly
revealing themselves and lifting off the ground to dance. Mike
is carried along with his table, still asleep.
Dracula takes out his ukelele and SLOWLY sings the ending to
Mavis as Johnny holds her. Some MONSTER COUPLES slow dance.
DRACULA
AND YOU’LL ALWAYS BE MY MOONLIGHT,
BUT NOW YOU CAN SHINE ON EVERYONE
BECAUSE YOU’RE... JOHNNY’S GIRL,
JOHNNY’S GIRL
READY TO FLY AND SEE THE WHOLE WIDE
WORLD
JOHNNY’S GIRL, AND KIND OF DADDY’S
TOO
YOUR MOMMY WOULD BE SO HAPPY
BECAUSE SHE ALWAYS KNEW
THAT LOVE IS MAKING ROOM FOR ALL
THE BEST FOR YOU...

Mavis runs from Johnny and hugs Dracula, teary eyed. Other

on Grandma Linda, soaking her entire body.

DRACULA
No, no no. You mustn’t give in to
your cravings! It’s not good for
the baby!

R

He produces a manual “WHAT TO EXPECT WHEN YOU’RE EXPECTING A
VAMPIRE” and reads from it. ZOMBIE WAITERS present the dishes
as Dracula mentions them.

Ab

DRACULA (CONT’D)
You need to increase your spider
intake, so he’ll be able to climb
ceilings properly. And eat lots of
goat bile.
MAVIS
I love you, Dad, but we don’t even
know if the kid’s gonna be a
vampire! I’d be thrilled if the
baby’s humany just like Johnny!
DRACULA
Humany? With thousands of years of
Dracula genes? Not gonna happen!
Here! Just have some monster ball
soup. It’s your Mommy’s recipe.

Dracula produces a tray of soup with balls of monster faces
gurgling in it. Mavis smiles, weakening - she loves her soup.
MAVIS
Aww...thank you Dad.

DRACULA
Of course! He’s the family, makes
sense to me!

CUT TO:

The BABY is just born, crying and the MONSTER DOCTOR is about
to hand it to Mavis as Johnny holds her. Suddenly, an odd
looking NURSE takes the baby instead and holds it.
NURSE

Oh, look! It’s a boy! It’s a boy!
The Dracula bloodline carries on!
(Dracula dark voice)
No one will ever harm you as long
as I’m here.

MAVIS

Clearly it’s Dracula in the nurse’s outfit wearing a mask.

MAVIS
Okay. Please, you two, I don’t want
him to hear his grandpas arguing.

color-haired vampire he is.

Grampa Mike repeatedly tosses a small BASEBALL to indifferent
Dennis as Dracula counters by tossing him a tiny TROLL.
JOHNNY
Okay! So, anyway...too bad you guys

So, Drac, I wanted to go through

DRACULA
Sure, of course. It’s a real job.

Right...so I was thinking. Since

some human staff...?

lounge act? The magician?
DRACULA
What’s wrong with Harry Three-Eye?

HARRY THREE-EYE
Tell me, sir, what was your card?
MONSTER VOLUNTEER
The three of spades.
Harry Three-Eye reaches into the Monster Volunteer’s body
cavity and pulls out the three of spades, sitting on his
stomach.
HARRY THREE-EYE

MUSIC: UPBEAT KID’S MUSIC a la Laurie Berkner or

with Dennis. They walk into a place called KIDBOREE.

- Mavis and Dracula sit within a circle of MOMMIES, all
holding a giant PARACHUTE over the kids. Dracula obviously
thinks it’s nuts but plays along, as Dennis laughs.
- Kids climb small ROCK WALLS. Dracula starts taking notes.
- At a wildlife center, happy KIDS are passing a cute GUINEA
PIG around. Dracula takes more notes.
- Very quick shots of Dracula taking more notes at a music
class (kids banging tiny instruments), Swimming class (Dennis
loaded up with floaties, fins and kickboard) and a yoga class
(mommies stretch with their kids).

- Back at hotel, Dracula is cheerfully showing Johnny all his
notes. Johnny is trying to be encouraging.

- Johnny and Dracula watch proudly as they direct Mavis and
Dennis. Mavis holds a parachute over Dennis, the only
student, as a YETI holds the rest. The Yeti sneezes and
absentmindedly grabs the parachute like a tissue.

R

- Mavis and Dennis are in a circle of Monsters and Kids who
are passing around a BUNNY. Dennis passes Wayne the bunny and
he puts it in his mouth, but Mavis quickly stops him and
Dracula removes the wet animal.

e

- Dennis climbing on spikes...reveal they’re on the back of a
LARGE MONSTER. A CHUBBY MONSTER KID climbs along but is too
big. He grabs hard at one spike and it comes off, spraying
pus everywhere. The Wolfpups charge in and wildly lick it up
off the floor.

- Dracula and Johnny carry Dennis over to a class marked
“Yoga.” They reach a stretching rack that a MONSTER KID is
being stretched on. Mavis enters from other side of frame and
quickly takes Dennis away.
- Dracula gently places Dennis in the POOL, again loaded up
with floaties, fins, and kickboard. All is nice when a huge
MONSTER HEAD emerges from the water and swallows Dennis.
Dracula dives in and punches the Monster in the head. It
opens his mouth and sticks out his tongue with Dennis and two
other scared KIDS sitting on it. As the Monster Head’s
MONSTER MOM berates her son for misbehaving, the other Kids
jump out. Dennis waves up to Mavis, who watches from poolside
with horror. Johnny smiles sheepishly next to her.

the bright street lamps. Dennis giggles.

Nice how they built it up.

Ok, left turn! This’ll be good,
Frank...the old windmill! Our

hands him an avocado, which Dennis peels and slices
correctly. Dennis shows Frank the slices, offering some.
Frank takes the pit in the middle and chews it.

WAYNE
First of all, you need to dial it
down. Second of all, I’m not
killing any people. I’m not gonna

make your kid like vampires. And
thirdly, there’s nothing to kill
here! It’s all been -COYOTE (O.C.)

Suddenly a coyote jumps on the hood of the hearse. Everyone
screams, except for Dennis, who laughs hysterically.

Coyote wants to come with us!
Griffin swerves the hearse. It causes the Blob’s Rascal
scooter to separate and it flies off the road and falls over
a cliff. Everyone is quiet for a moment.

CAMP DIRECTOR

Oh! This little... red headed...
non-fangy lil’ guy?
DRACULA
Oh, they’re in there. He’s a late
fanger. Can you show us some of the

mice?

CAMP DIRECTOR
Can do. Course, now we call it teemousing.
EXT. FIELD - MOMENTS LATER

The Camp Director has brought them all to a tee-ball version
of mice-eating. Mice are on a tee instead of being caught in
the wild. The kids run up one at a time and grab the mouse.

R

DRACULA
So they don’t have to catch the
mice?

Ab

CAMP DIRECTOR
Nope. We find this is a good way to
build their confidence.
One kid is having trouble getting the mouse.

It’s right there!

Kid grabs the mouse and runs off.
DANA
Hokey Pokey. Wanna mouse, Dennis?
Yeah!

DENNIS

CAMP DIRECTOR
Any allergies, color restrictions?

He can eat a mouse!

A COUNSELOR brings out a big bowl of mice and the kids all

CAMP DIRECTOR
Not too many! Remember, kids, a
vampire always shares!
DRACULA
Shares. Again with the shares. Are
you hearing this, fellas? Fellas?
The other monsters are playing Badminton with Campers.
FRANKENSTEIN

Papa learned to fly!
DENNIS
Ooh, I wanna fly!

Pan to reveal the tower is guarded off.

DANA
Ah, yeah... we’re over here now.

Vampire kids with instructors are lined up to jump off a four
foot high tower. All are wearing helmets and padding. Some
jump off and retain the padding even when they turn to bats.
DANA (CONT’D)
Had to scale it down. Insurance.
The last Vampire kid jumps and fails, swinging on the rope.
In background we hear:
Help me.

VAMPIRE KID
Help me.

JOHNNY
Yeah...Mavis...?

MAVIS
Oh, I’m gonna try and sleep tonight.

GRANDMA LINDA
Good! Cuz I bought like the 150

She produces a huge bottle of 150 SPF sunblock and a poncho.
GRANDMA LINDA (CONT’D)
And I have a sunhat, but otherwise
this poncho if you want to be safe.
GRAMPA MIKE
We can figure that out in the

“Thriller” is playing.

Mavis smiles but looks at Johnny confused. Johnny cringes.

Maybe that one’s before your time.
Oh, wait, you’re a hundred twenty

MAVIS
I just never heard current music
growing up in Transylvania.

GRANDMA LINDA
Yeah. Transylvania. That was a fun
experience. Mike was afraid he’d
get eaten and I told him he was
being silly. But, now, you just may
fall in love with Santa Cruz.

MAVIS
Oh, I do love it!
Johnny looks stressed and makes an unintelligible sound.
GRANDMA LINDA
Oh, and especially for little
Dennis not being a monster and all,
it’s very kid friendly.

Doorbell rings.
GRANDMA LINDA (CONT’D)
Oh, there they are. You know, we

Grandma Linda enters with two couples, CAREN and PANDRAGORA,
who’s a freaky-looking but chill monster with a Stoner accent.
GRANDMA LINDA
Hi, Caren, hi Pandragora.
CAREN
Welcome, Mavis!
As Pandragora speaks he casually grabs and eats flying
insects.

PANDRAGORA
Yeah, you’re gonna dig it here!
Don’t even worry, people are totally
cool with the intermarriage thing.
CAREN
Oh, Pandragora.

He does not read people very well.
Not everybody is “totally cool”.

The next couple walks in, LORETTA and PAUL, who’s super hairy
with a scraggly beard.

GRANDMA LINDA
Oh, hey you guys! And this is
Loretta, she’s married to Paul,
who’s a werewolf.
PAUL

Excuse me?

GRANDMA LINDA
Yes. I was telling Mavis about the
other monster/human couples in
town.

I am not a werewolf.

The cupcakes’ frosting is a gross eyeball design. Mavis
smiles politely.
Johnny’s brother Brett enters with COZY, a sweet cocker
spaniel who gently kisses Johnny.
BRETT
We’re back from the senior home!
JOHNNY
Cozy! How’s my sweet girl?

Cozy sees Mavis and attacks her, pouncing barking and nipping
crazily.
JOHNNY (CONT’D)
Whoa! Cozy, no!
Johnny pulls Cozy off.

GRANDMA LINDA
Oh, dear, I forgot, Cozy has a
monster phobia. Just hates them.

Cozy dives onto Pandragora, who isn’t fazed.

PANDRAGORA
Ah, that’s cool. I get it.

GRANDMA LINDA
We better tie her up. And to think
she’s a therapy dog!

Brett takes Cozy away, still barking at Mavis, who maintains
her forced smile. Cozy bursts loose and goes nuts in the
distance.

climbs the tower holding Dennis as the others follow.

MURRAY
Why are we doing this?

Someone’s oozing pus, my lord...
Kill-baya...
FRANKENSTEIN
We shouldn’t be up here, Drac.
DRACULA
Who’s ready to fly?
DENNIS
Me! Me! Like a superhero!
FRANKENSTEIN
This thing is rickety, maybe the

Dracula shoots out of frame in a flash. As a bat, he flies at
Dennis as we reveal all the campers shooting with their
smartphones as they watch him fall. Dracula swoops and
catches Dennis one foot before impact, flying a triumphant
loop-de-loop afterwards.
DRACULA (CONT’D)
I told you, Papa’s always here for
you.
DENNIS
Yay, Papa! Again!
They land as Dana frantically approaches them.
DANA
Oh dear. Oh my devil. We’re gonna

Whoa, listen to me! That was fun!
Your singing is child abuse.
ANGLE ON the top of the tower.

Should we go down and help him?
FRANKENSTEIN
Nope. I told him this was nuts.
He’s on his own.

Frankenstein acts bored and leans against the rail.
In the distant background, we see the tall tower. It is
starting to tilt on the side Frank is leaning.
DANA
I’m gonna need some information.

You will not follow protocol.
DANA

DANA
Now, please, give me her phone
number. Don’t make me call the
police.
The Camp Kids start screaming as the tower comes closer.
DRACULA
No one’s calling nobody!
Suddenly the tower slams to the ground, landing right on the
campfire! Frank catches fire and goes insane as everyone
scatters. Wayne and Murray chase and scream at Frank, trying
to get him to calm down. Frank screams in terror and runs
aimlessly through different buildings, setting them, and the
hearse, on fire.

Why do I feel so weird being here?

JOHNNY
No, hon, they’re being weird.

Ab

MAVIS
Really? I don’t know anything.
Famous songs, Slurpées. I can’t
believe all the stuff I’ve missed
living inside that hotel. At least
if Dennis grows up away from
Transylvania, he won’t be weird
like me.
JOHNNY
Are you nuts? Mavis. You’re a
blast. You’re so full of life, and
curious about everything. If Dennis
grows up to be just like you I’ll
be the luckiest dad in the world.

DRACULA
This cannot happen. For any of us.
But there’s one last way I can fix
this before Denisovich turns 5.

Ab

Dracula grimly drives the hearse with Frankenstein. It
drives down a DARK, WINDY PATH, lower and lower, until they
get out of the hearse. They walk down a DARK HILL until they
hit bottom. Then they walk down a STEEP STAIRCASE made of
stone until they hit bottom. Then they walk down into a
LARGE HOLE. Then they crawl on their rear ends down the hole
as they shoo away mice and moles nipping at them. The tunnel
finally leads to ANOTHER HOLE which they emerge out of, only
to step on a STEEP CLIFF.
DRACULA
Oh, gimme a break already!
They slide down the STEEP CLIFF, catching branches in various
spots to slow their fall, finally landing on their asses.
They start to walk.
DRACULA (CONT’D)
Pretty sure it’s straight ahea -They fall through a TRAP DOOR and are now falling through a
seemingly endless vacuum.

Frank screams as Dracula shakes his head. Suddenly they landed
hard on their asses. They are now right in front of the DARK
CAVE of Dracula’s father, VLAD.
DRACULA (CONT’D)
(to Frankenstein)
Can’t believe I’m doing this.
Suddenly an evil-looking SENTRY jumps out from the cave
causing Frankenstein to recoil.
SENTRY
Who goest there?
DRACULA
It’s Count Dracula.

SENTRY
Oh....Well, it’s about time.
DRACULA
Just tell him I’m here.

MOMENTS LATER, Dracula and Frankenstein navigate through the
cave’s corridors, filled with spiders and finally see two
glowing eyes in the darkness. They land in the lair of VLAD,
an ancient vampire, who emerges from the darkness.

VLAD
Well, look what the bat dragged in.

DRACULA
Yes, hi, Dad.
VLAD
Fellas, you won’t believe it! It’s

as the day he deserted me!

Vlad’s horrifying DEMONIC CRONIES, ancient monsters hovering
in shadows, howl and scream with laughter.
VLAD (CONT’D)
This is certainly unexpected, boy.
It’s only been 600 years or so.

Well, maybe if you were nicer to my

Please don’t do that, Dad.
Vlad drops Frankenstein, making a crack on the cave floor.

you need from me?
DRACULA
It’s my grandson, Denisovich.

Oh, you have a grandson! So your

DRACULA
Maybe we should help this along.
VLAD
Okay, we can do that...we’ll need
to conduct a ceremony. A sacrifice.
We will sacrifice the thing the kid
cherishes the most.
DRACULA
Wow. That’s necessary? He’s just a
nice little kid -VLAD
That’s the problem! We have to
remove what’s holding him back from
his dark destiny. It’s like a wussy
exorcism. Of course, I’ll need his
whole family present, you, Mavis,
the kid’s father.

Suddenly TROY comes over in a costume of VRAK, a freaky Power
Rangers villain.
Batman!!

TROY

Dennis is startled and falls backwards. Troy takes off his
mask and laughs at Dennis, who’s embarrassed. Mavis looks at
Dennis sympathetically.
Off to the side, Dracula coaches Johnny, who is dressed like
a vampire, but it’s the crazy hair and flamboyant clothes
Gary Oldman wore in Bram Stoker’s Dracula.

The Demonic Cronies fly and run toward the Hotel.
INT. BALLROOM - MOMENTS LATER

The Cronies burst in, smashing through all the ballroom
windows and everyone is terrified. Frankenstein dismembers
out of shock. Dracula looks at Vlad, pissed.

VLAD
Witness! Humans coexisting with
Monsters! Sharing towels and spoons!
The Cronies scream in anger and disbelief!
VLAD (CONT’D)
Destroy it all!

Gasps from patrons, then screams as all hell breaks loose.
The Cronies start flying around, ransacking the lobby,
including some stuff set up for the party, like the bouncy
house, sending Dennis’ Mean Kid Cousins flying. Our Monsters
watch helplessly, including Wayne, Wanda, Murray and Griffin.

How do we stop these guys?!

Dennis hears hubbub and looks out. More Demonic Cronies run
right past their fort to the hotel! Dennis stands at the
entrance.
DENNIS
I think something bad’s happening.
I think we need to go back.
WINNIE
If you think so, my zing. I’m right
behind you!
He gets up and she follows him as starts to hustle back
albeit way slower than the Demonic Cronies.
*

Mavis and Johnny are still looking for Dennis. The Cronies
are jacking the Knights and make their way towards screaming
humans. Zombies try to defend and are wasted fast. They
charge toward guests, ripping Ghost sheets from tables that
was hiding humans. Monsters still try and defend - the Human
Fly buzzes around annoying a Crony. The insanity busts out of
ballroom and also partly into the lobby now.

*
*
*
*
*
*

Now the Humans, including Johnny’s family, start to battle
the Cronies as well - getting weapons from the Suits of Armor
and riding the Ghost Tables. They fight gallantly but only
Dracula is really able to neutralize a few, bailing the
others out, and keeping the fight going. Vlad gets involved,
assisting his minions. Dracula uses his powers to block him
repeatedly. They start telekinetically throwing things at
each other. Then, suddenly, Dracula notices his powers are
gone.

Dracula looks over and sees Vlad with burning hypno-eyes.
VLAD
Your powers are right here, boy.
With me!

Daaaaad! That’s not fair!!

Your Daddy knows what’s best for

Vlad waves and makes Dracula have a thumb in his mouth.
Dracula angrily struggles to remove it but he can’t.
EXT. HOTEL - CONTINUOUS
Dennis and Winnie get to the hotel and run in.
INT. HOTEL LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER
Dennis and Winnie run into the lobby. With Dracula undone,
the Cronies are running wild, and actually starting to toss
around actual relatives and Monsters.
VLAD (CONT’D)
No, no! I said to destroy the
hotel! Not the people!

Dennis sees what’s happening and runs forward.

Stop it!

But they are out of control…they won’t listen. The Monsters
and Humans try their best to hold their ground. Vlad
witnesses Johnny’s brother Brett dive to push Marty out of
the way of a Crony’s blistering punches, taking one in the
face. Vlad is stunned.

A few Cronies turn to see Dennis and start laughing at him.

DENNIS (CONT’D)
Leave them alone.

A Crony ROARS at him and he recoils, but then gets back on
his feet. Mavis spots Dennis and screams.
Dennis!

MAVIS
Run!

DENNIS

I’m a Bat...I’m a Bat...
Dennis braces himself and jumps, flapping his arms - he tries
to fly at the Crony! But he falls flat, and they laugh again.
DEMONIC CRONY
What a joke!
The Crony picks him up menacingly.
Dennis!

Mavis runs toward him and is grabbed by another Crony.
Johnny is grabbed by yet another.
MAVIS (CONT’D)
Let go of me!
JOHNNY
That’s our boy!

Hey! Don’t touch my Mommy and Daddy!

Why not?

DEMONIC CRONY
Sorry, Curly, there's nothing you
can do about it. Cebause you’re
just a weak...little...boyyy.
Dennis closes his eyes, summons up all his anger...and
suddenly makes the fierce red eyed vampire face Dracula makes
and growls like Dracula! And then - bares fangs!
Suddenly exploding with power, Dennis breaks free from the
Demonic Crony and hurtles him with his mind, sending him
flipping across the room!
The other monsters attack Dennis and he defeats them in
sequence, dodging them with super speed, pounding them with
super strength and making them freeze, rise, and smash into
each other with mind control. Mavis and Johnny are set free
as a result. One Crony slams into Vlad, breaking Vlad’s
concentration. Dracula seizes on it and regains his powers.
Inspired, Mavis and Dracula join in the fight with renewed
energy. Vlad watches and decides not to try and stop them.
Four more monsters approach Dennis.

DENNIS
There’s a mouse at the end of your
butts!
The Monsters chase their butts exactly like the Wolfpups did.

Other monsters/humans are rallied and emboldened by the
sudden turn of fate. They lay it on the cronies with
righteous fury.

Frank finally gets put back together and does something
completely awesome.

Wayne sics his wolf pack onto the cronies.

The three of them continue kicking ass. They transform back
and forth into bats, whizzing too fast for the Demons and
slamming them into stuff.

*
*
*
*

Even Vlad sees the sides working together, and finally can’t
help himself. He becomes a bat and joins in the fight
against the Cronies.

*
*
*

Finally, Dennis, in human form, lifts the last Monster and
tosses him high into the air, bursting through the roof.
Dennis raises his arms in celebration and lets out a roar!
The Demonic Cronies Fly away, terrified. As the last
surviving minions flee we are left with a Magnificent 7-style
line up in front of the hotel. Drac and Vlad back to back,
Mavis and Johnny, all the friends, Dennis in front of them
all. Then, he and Mavis run to each other.

Hearse without a driver comes crashing airborne through lobby

Mavis hugs Dennis. Johnny and Dracula run in.
Daddy!

DENNIS (CONT’D)

He hugs Johnny and looks at Dracula.
Papa!

DRACULA
I don’t care, Dennis. I'm just glad
you're my grandson.

Dracula hugs Dennis and sheds a tear.
MAVIS
Dad, I’m so sorry. You were right.
DRACULA
No, baby, neither of us were right.
We wanted to tell Dennis who he
was, instead of letting him find
out for himself.
DENNIS
Did you just call me Dennis?

VLAD

Yeah, he called you Dennis! He
realizes he was wrong!
DRACULA

Yes. Only I was wrong.

he cherished was his family.

VLAD

And you...with this crazy hotel.

Yeah, what about it?
VLAD
I just saw a roomful of humans
fighting for monsters. You made all
of this possible. I’m proud of you,
Count. Viva Hotel Transylvania!

Humans together!

Everyone cheers. Johnny looks at Vlad meaningfully.
JOHNNY
So...you approve of me?

Vlad studies it and is weirded out.
