THE INTERN
by
Nancy Meyers

January 2014

FADE IN:
EXT. PROSPECT PARK - BROOKLYN - AN EARLY SPRING MORNING
An eclectic Group ranging in age from 30 to 80 gather in rows
performing the ancient Chinese martial art of TAI CHI. They
are led by their young and graceful Instructor. CAMERA
GLIDES PAST one student to the next, as they move in sync
through their meditative poses. CREDITS BEGIN.
BEN (V.O.)
Freud said, “Love and work, work
and love. That’s all there is.”
Well, I’m retired and my wife is
dead.
And on that, we ARRIVE on BEN WHITTAKER. Ben just turned
Seventy, an Everyman in many ways, but a unique man to all
who know him. He exhales as he turns in sync with the others.
BEN (V.O.)
-- As you can imagine, that has
given me some time on my hands.
INT. BEN’S HOUSE - BROOKLYN - NIGHT
BEN, wearing a suit and tie, sits in an upright chair in his
comfortable brownstone, TALKING TO CAMERA. Looks like he’s
on VIDEO.
BEN
My wife’s been gone for three-and-ahalf years. I miss her in every
way. And retirement -- that is an
ongoing, relentless effort in
creativity. At first, I admit, I
enjoyed the novelty of it. Sort of
felt like I was playing hooky.
EXT. JFK TARMAC - NEW YORK CITY - DAY
A jumbo jet lifts off.
BEN V.O.
I used all the miles I had saved
and traveled the globe.

2.
INT. BEN’S BROWNSTONE - BROOKLYN - NIGHT
Ben ENTERS in an overcoat, carrying his suitcase and wearing
a purple lei around his neck. He stands for a moment in his
quiet, empty house.
BEN V.O.
Problem was, no matter where I
went, as soon as I got home, the
nowhere to be thing hit me like a
ton of bricks.
EXT. BROOKLYN STREET - MORNING RUSH HOUR - WINTER
It’s noisy. Ben walks among the crowd, paper under his arm.
BEN V.O.
I realized the key to this whole
deal was to keep moving. Get up,
get out of the house and go
somewhere. Anywhere.
INT. PARK SLOPE STARBUCKS - MORNING
Crowded with folks on their way to work. Ben sits on a stool
at a corner table with a bagel and the morning’s Post.
BEN V.O.
Come rain or shine, I’m at my
Starbucks by 7:15. Can’t explain
it, but it makes me feel part of
something.
Two Male Execs in their 40’s, ask Ben if they can share his
table. Ben’s delighted, moves his papers. The Guys take the
two remaining stools, turn them away from Ben and begin an
impromptu meeting -- as if Ben wasn’t even there.
INT. BEN’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Ben to CAMERA.
BEN
How do I spend the rest of my days?
You name it. Golf, movies, books,
pinochle, tried yoga, learned to
cook, bought some plants, took
classes in Mandarin.
(SPEAKS MANDARIN)
Translation? Believe me, I’ve tried
everything.

3.
INT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY
Ben walks the center aisle between the pews. Many of his
friends sit around him. He pats a back or two as he looks
for an empty seat.
BEN V.O.
And then of course, there are the
funerals. So many more than I could
imagine.
As Ben looks for a seat, a cute number about Ben’s age, PATTY
POMERANTZ, smiles at him, hoping he’ll sit next to her. Just
then, Ben spots his friend, MILES, who shows him he saved him
a seat. Ben smiles back at Patty but joins Miles, who shakes
his head at their deceased friend, lying before them. Ben
looks at his friend, tears quickly welling in his eyes.
CLOSE - AN OPEN SUITCASE
On Ben’s BED. Ben places TWO GIFTS wrapped in Toy Store
wrapping paper on top of his clothes, zips his bag shut.
BEN (V.O)
The only traveling I do these days
is out to San Diego to visit my son
and his family.
A CHILD’S BEDROOM CEILING - NIGHT
The ceiling is filled with stars that glisten in the dark.
CAMERA TILTS DOWN past them.
BEN V.O.
They’re all so great, I love ‘em
to pieces, but to be honest, I
think I’ve probably relied on them
way more than I should.
We arrive on a LITTLE GIRL ASLEEP in the top bunk of a bunkbed. As CAMERA CONTINUES TO BOOM DOWN we find Ben wide awake
in the bottom bunk under Dora the Explorer sheets.
BEN (V.O)
Don’t get me wrong. I’m not an
unhappy person. Quite the contrary.
I just know there’s a hole in my
life and I need to fill it.
Ben TURNS TOWARD CAMERA, turns out a small lamp and the
SCREEN goes BLACK.
Soon.

BEN (V.O.)

4.
EXT. MARKET - BROOKLYN - DAY
Ben EXITS carrying groceries, just about passing by the
market’s colorful Bulletin Board.
BEN (V.O.)
Which brings me to this morning,
when I was leaving Trader Joe’s and
caught your flyer out of the corner
of my eye.
CAMERA WHIPS to a flyer -- Senior Internship Program at
ClothesThatFit.com. OVER Ben’s V.O. reads: Seniors -- Be an Intern!
We Need Your Experience and We’ll Teach You What We Know! Apply
Today!

ON BEN. Amused and intrigued. As he reaches for the flyer -PATTY (O.S.)
I thought that was you!
Ben turns to find Patty, the woman from the Funeral.
PATTY (cont’d)
What’d you find?
(reads for herself)
Senior Internship Program at... How
do you pronounce this? I hate when
they don’t put spaces between the
words.
BEN
ClothesThatFit.com. I think an
internet place is looking for
Senior Interns. Am I reading that
right?
PATTY
Lemme see.
(skims the Flyer)
You have to be over 65, have
organizational skills, genuine
interest in e-commerce, whatever
that is, and a roll up your sleeves
attitude. Well, that’s you to a T,
kid.
BEN
ClothesThatFit... Is that the
outfit that took over the-PATTY
Yeah, I think they bought one of
the factories on Front Street. My
daughter tells me they sell clothes
on the web. How that works, I have
no idea.

5.
Ben tears off the Flyer, then seems thrown.
BEN
Oh. You have to upload the
application. That could be
challenging. Listen to this.
(reads)
Cover letters are so old fashioned.
(they both react, Ben
continues reading)
So show us who you are with a cover
letter video.
(Patty’s confused, Ben
reads)
Upload your video to youtube or
vimeo using .mov, .avi or an .mpg
file. We look forward to meeting
you.
(amused)
Okay. I guess that’s meeting me.
PATTY
I swear, I don’t even know what
language that was. What are you
doin’ tonight Ben?
(peeks in his grocery bag)
Frozen Lasagne... I could make a
little salad and turn that into
dinner for two.
(confidentially)
Like we did that time but never did
again. That was five months ago,
you know.
BEN
(sweetly)
Was it? Yeah, no, we should do that
again for sure but okay by you if I
take a rain check?
PATTY
You’re cute you know that?
BEN
No, I didn’t...
Ben bends down to kiss Patty on the cheek. She takes his face
and kisses him on the lips.
PATTY
Don’t wait too long, doll. We’re
not gettin’ any younger.
INT. BEN’S KITCHEN - THAT NIGHT
Ben washes his dinner plate, puts it in the empty dish rack.
Then washes a single glass, puts that in the dish rack.

6.
1 A.M. - BEN CAN’T SLEEP
He stares at the ceiling, then impulsively tosses off the
covers.
A MOTORIZED TIE RACK SWINGS into action.
selects a tie.

Ben decisively

IN THE BATHROOM, now wearing a crisp suit and tie, Ben combs
his hair. Looks at himself, knows what he has to do.
BEN (V.O.)
So -- here I am...
INT. BEN’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
An old model Camcorder is perched on a table, it’s red RECORD
light ON. CAMERA circles behind the Camcorder until it finds
what it’s shooting -- BEN, in his suit and tie.
BEN
-- applying to be one of your
interns because the more I think
about this idea, the more
tremendous I think it is. I have a
ton of knowledge I can share. Love
the idea of having a place I can go
every day. I want the connection,
the excitement, I want to be
challenged and I guess I might even
want to be needed. The tech stuff
might take a bit to figure out, I
had to call my nine year old
grandson just to find out what a
USB connector was...but I’ll get
there. Eager to learn. Also, want
you to know, I’ve been a company
man all my life. I’m loyal, I’m
trustworthy and I’m good in a
crisis. I read once, musicians
don’t retire. They stop when
there’s no more music in them.
Well, I still have music in me.
Absolutely positive about that.
INT. THE FANTASTIC OFFICES OF CLOTHESTHATFIT.COM - DAY
A former factory retrofitted as an enormous bullpen. It’s a
football field of cubicles buzzing like a trading floor.
Some have described it as organized chaos -- it’s a young
company growing at hyper-speed. The surroundings are not
fancy but there’s a coolness factor here that can’t be
denied. It’s a start up that’s taken off.

7.
Everyone working here is either young or really young. Cute,
fashion-y women and sweatshirt-clad engineers.
CAMERA quickly moves past cubicles, ENTERING the very swamped
CUSTOMER SERVICE area, where 25 Young Men and Women wear
headsets and chat to their Customers. As we pass by, we HEAR:
”Good news, I found a size 8 in navy!”
“You’re right, it
should have arrived by now, let me track that for you.” “Yep,
these pants are awesome if you have hips. Super slimming.”
“Yes, we are called ClothesThatFit and I’m very sorry the
dress didn’t fit... Sir.”
We arrive at the last cubicle where JULES OSTIN is mid-call.
Jules has been “leaning in” since pre-school -- hard-wired to
be something, to do something. She prides herself in not
wanting to be stereotyped. Her strongest attribute is her
very big brain, which unfortunately for those around her,
never shuts down. Ever.
JULES
(into headset)
Okay, let me just review this with
you. You have six bridesmaids and
you bought six of the silk chiffon
Antoinette dresses, in pink. The
wedding is in three days and the
dresses arrived this morning -- all
in charcoal gray.
(a co-worker overhears,
mouth agape)
-- which we don’t even sell, so
that’s a bit of a mystery. Rachel,
please don’t cry, you have to look
fresh for your wedding. Really,
let me cry ‘cause this is entirely
our fault. So, okay, here’s what
we’re going to do. I’m going to
call the vendor and get this fixed
today, I will personally see the
dresses myself before they are Fed
Exed and they will be at your front
door by 10 a.m. on Friday. Let me
give you my cell just in case...
Ready? 917-582-4848.
(Others around her take
note of this)
Okay? --Well, you’re starting to
sound a little better already.
Thank you so much for your
patience. Oh! I’m also going to
refund you back 50% on each dress.
It’s the least we can do. No -thank you! So check this one off
your list, this is done! And
Rachel, have a great wedding!
(hangs up)
OhmyGod, how did that happen?

8.
Jules looks up and sees her perennially overwrought YOUNG
ASSISTANT, BECKY -- just out of college and a little nervous
around Jules. Becky is an incredibly hard worker but
unfortunately has no ability to prioritize or organize.
JULES (cont’d)
(rises )
I know, I’m late for something.
BECKY
Yeah. Everything.
JULES
But you see why I take customer
service calls? This is so good.
Learn so much. What’s up? What’s
going on?
As Becky reads from a Post-It, Jules climbs onto a nearby
bike, starts to peddle through the office. Becky tries to
keep up, talks fast.
BECKY
Okay. Candice was waiting for you
but had another meeting, she said
she’ll be back at Two. Your 11:00
is in the conference room, so is
your 11:10, finance needs you and I
guess you e-mailed a bunch of
people at 4 a.m. about something?
JULES
-- Oh, good! I forgot about that. I
want to figure out a way for
girlfriends to shop together on
line...make it less of an alone
thing. E-mail me that idea, will
ya?
BECKY
Yeah, I like that.
(writing quickly, takes
out Phone)
Is now a good time to call your
Mother back?
JULES
(What?)
Dude, I’m on a bike...
A small Group sings Happy Birthday to a co-worker. They hope
Jules will stop by but she just waves instead as she pedals
past.
Jules passes by an EMPTY CUBICLE which everyone uses to store
their crap. It’s filled with files, shoe boxes, hangers,
computer cords. An eye sore. Jules squints at the mess as
she rides by.

9.
JULES LANDS IN HER CHAIR - AT HER DESK
Near the FRONT OF THE ROOM. On her desk is a ridiculous
stack of work, a computer with two monitors, a laptop and a
sign that says “FOCUS”.
JULES (cont’d)
(without looking up)
Becky...
(Becky arrives out of
breath.)
Can you patch me in. You okay?
Becky nods, hits a few keys on her phone, nods to Jules.
JULES (cont’d)
(picks up her phone, then
OVER THE P.A.)
I need creative and marketing...
and the buying and merchandizing
teams for the silk chiffon
Antoinette dress. Oh! Also... Just
did some Customer Service calls we got a great review from a
customer in Michigan who said
(pulls a note out of her
pocket, reads)
-- opening our box was like giving
a gift to herself. Thought that was
cool.
A WAVE starts across the office, and as it reaches Jules, she
does a half-assed version and is off to the Conference Room.
INT. CTF LOBBY - SAME TIME
A couple of White Leather Sofas, iPads on security cords sit
on a coffee table. Huge CTF photos on the walls. Lady Gaga
plays in the b.g.
Ben, in a suit and tie, takes in his surroundings as he
approaches the 21-year-old jeans and tank top wearing
Receptionist who’s eating a taco. Behind her, a huge flat
screen runs behind-the-scenes footage of a photo shoot.
BEN
Hi, I’m Ben Whittaker. I received
an e-mail about an interview for
the Senior Intern Program.
(kind of laughs at the
idea)
RECEPTIONIST
Hey Ben, how’s it goin’?

10.
BEN
It’s goin’ good. Real good. Thank
you.
RECEPTIONIST
Excellent. Take a seat right
around the corner and someone from
Talent Acquisition will come get
you.
Ben thanks her, heads around the corner mumbling, “Talent
Acquisition” and sees a dozen older folks waiting for
interviews. It looks like a Doctor’s waiting room. Ben takes
a seat among them.
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - UPSTAIRS -

SAME TIME

A long white table and white chairs. Jules and a group of coworkers stand, crowding around a computer. One of the girls
in the group, holds a small dog.
JULES
Guys, you have to remember, the
home page has to read in a glance.
(backs 4 feet away)
Also, none of you are over thirty
so you need to get back like this
to see what this looks like if
you’re like over 35.
(squints)
Okay, so I can’t see anything, but
if I could see it, what do you want
me to read?
(reading)
Nine girls one shirt or Check out
the fit.
ROBBY, mid-twenties, jeans, T-shirt.
ROBBY
Both. But I really want you to see
the shirt worn by nine different
body types.
JULES
Okay, then you gotta make me see
that. Try making the photo grid
bigger and the type smaller.
(the Photo grid ENLARGES)
Oh! Love that one of them’s
pregnant.
ZOE - cute, 30, Asian and pregnant.
Thanks.

ZOE

11.
JULES
It would be good if you could put
the girl in the red shirt in the
middle? It’s a great red. It’s
gonna fly outta here.
ROBBY
We really don’t have the time,
Jules. I needed you to sign off on
this two hours ago.
JULES
I know, but can you try?
Robby and Zoe exchange a look as a Tech kid works quickly.
JULES (cont’d)
Mia, tell me that thing again.
MIA, striped Tee, bold glasses, typing on her laptop.
MIA
Forty-six percent of our visitors
don’t go past the home page.
JULES
Man, we have to fix that. How long
do we have them for before they
leave?
MIA
Seven to nine seconds.
JULES
(totally focused on that
remark manages to say)
Did we order lunch?
ZOE
(yells)
Becky!
The Techie spins his laptop around, shows the new Home Page
to Jules.
I love it.

JULES

TECHIE
(hits a few keys)
And it’s up.
JULES
Thank you!
(turns to another group at
the table)
(MORE)

12.
JULES (cont'd)
Okay, the Antoinette dress. Major
screw up by the vendor.
DOWNSTAIRS -- A TINY 22 YEAR OLD - KEIRA
In a short sundress, Converse, purple braided hair, walks Ben
into her SMALL OFFICE.
KEIRA
There’s going to be a couple of
interviews today, Ben. We want to
make sure both of us find the right
fit. Business as usual is not
really our motto so hope you have
some fun here.
Ben nods, takes a seat in a hot pink chair across from Keira
who sits cross-legged on a sofa.
KEIRA (cont’d)
This is the first time we’re hiring
Senior interns. Our Team Manager
thought it would be an important
interface with the community so our
Intern questions might not exactly
fit your profile, but, we’re gonna
go for it anyway, okay?
Fire away.

BEN

KEIRA
Okay. Good. Where’d you go to
school?
BEN
I went to Northwestern.
KEIRA
Hey, my brother went to
Northwestern!
BEN
Probably not at the same time.
KEIRA
Probably not. He graduated in 2009.
BEN
-- Class of ‘65.
KEIRA
Whoa. What was your major?
remember?
BEN BEING INTERVIEWED

Do you

13.
By a more Senior Exec.

SAMANTHA is 25.

SAMANTHA
And after Northwestern you went on
to..?
BEN
I went to work for Dex One. Became
the Vice President of print
publishing.
SAMANTHA
Okay, and they made..?
BEN
Phone books.
(Samantha goes a bit
blank)
I was in charge of overseeing the
printing of the physical phone
book. I did that for the last 20
years and before that, I was their
VP of Sales and Advertising.
SAMANTHA
Of the phone book thing?
(Ben nods)
So do they still make phone books?
I mean, doesn’t everyone just
Google numbers?
BEN
-- I believe they do. But before
google, it was how you...
SAMANTHA
No, yeah, I get it.
INTERVIEWER #3 - JUSTIN
Sweet faced, wishes he could grow a beard, reads from an
iPad.
JUSTIN
-- So, 40 years at the phone book
company. That’s amazing.
Seriously. So, Benjamin, this is
one of our more telling questions
for all of our Interns, so I want
you to think about this one. Take
your time -- Where do you see
yourself in 10 years?
BEN
(amused)
When I’m 80?

14.
JUSTIN
Sure. Whatever.
(checks application in
front of him)
Wow. Did not realize you were 70.
That’s just not a good question for
you. Should we just scratch that
one and not--?
BEN
Your call, Justin.
JUSTIN
Thanks. Okay. It’s gone.
(then)
You look great by the way. And
you’re clearly more than qualified
for the job. You’re super over
qualified. What can I say -- great
video, great interviews -- Ben,
you’re in it to win it! You got it,
man. Congrats. You’re an intern.
INT. JULES'S CUBICLE

- LATER THAT DAY

Jules is behind her desk, talking to Eli from the Tech Team.
Several other tech guys stand behind him, all looking weary.
JULES
So you’re saying by speeding up
check out....
ELI
-- eighty percent of the addresses
in the last 24 hours got screwed
up.
JULES
Oh, God...
(Zoe passes by)
Zoe, how’s that red shirt doing?
ZOE
Sold out. We just ordered two
hundred more.
JULES
See if you can cancel that. Just
say “Sold Out”.
(Zoe looks confused)
It’s more exciting.
BECKY
Jules, the Photo Studio really
really needs you.

15.
JULES
(rising, then to Eli)
Two really’s. I gotta go.
ELI
Jules, we need to deal with this.
JULES
I know. Okay, just go back to the
way it was but then can you do a
deep dive on this? We have to
eliminate a button. Think One Click
at Amazon. We need our version of
that. Gotta make it faster.
CANDICE COOK, the Number Two person at CTF joins Jules.
CANDICE
I need you for two minutes -uninterrupted.
Candice is the Ying to Jules's Yang. She came to CTF via
eBay and to eBay via Harvard. Candice is the accessible,
straight-forward, go-to-person for everyone at the company.
Jules, washing her hands with Purell, joins Candice. Candice
opens her palm and Jules squirts some Purell in as they zig
zag around desks.
CANDICE (cont’d)
Remember when we talked a few weeks
ago about the Senior Intern
Program?
JULES
(reading her phone)
No...
CANDICE
Seriously? We had a big
conversation about it.
JULES
We did? Remind me. Seniors in high
school or in college?
CANDICE
Seniors in life. Older people.
JULES
(looks up)
Hold on. What?
CANDICE
I told you I felt we needed to do
an outreach program. You seemed to
(MORE)

16.
CANDICE (cont'd)
be liking the idea so I put it in
motion. It’s gonna be great.
JULES
Hold please. You’re hiring Senior
Citizen interns? What does that
even mean?
CANDICE
There’s been a ton of research on
this. The results are, without
fail, fantastic. Imagine an intern
with a lifetime of experience as
opposed to someone who has spent
the last four years of their life
playing beer pong.
JULES
Do they eventually want jobs here?
CANDICE
No, they’re all retired. They just
want the experience. And I want one
to work directly with you.
JULES
Candice, c’mon. First of all, I’m
not great with older people... you
know how I am with my parents. Why
do I have to have one?
CANDICE
Because you have to set the tone.
JULES
Isn’t that your job?
It’s my job to make it your job.
You’re the founder, everyone looks
to you. Now, would you prefer a man
or a woman? There’s a great 70
year old woman.
JULES
That’s like the same age as my
mother. That’s too weird.
CANDICE
Fine. There’s a man everyone loves.
I saw his video. He seems amazing.
They arrive at the PHOTO STUDIO where all the photos for the
site are taken. Models, racks of clothes, hair dressers and
make-up artists swarm about. As Jules joins the commotion...

17.
JULES
This is not going to work in my
opinion, but how long do I have to
do it for? Minimum.
CANDICE
(taking off)
Six weeks or we’ll be sued.
JULES
I know we never talked about this.
CANDICE
Yeah, we did. He starts tomorrow!
INT. BEN’S BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT
Ben, excited for his first day of work, sits in his pj’s, on
the side of his bed, setting his alarm. He then sets a back
up alarm on another clock, placing the two clocks next to one
another.
Ben crosses to his dresser and reviews his wardrobe selection
for tomorrow. Hanging on the knobs of the dresser are his
suit, shirt, tie. Ben opens a new shoe box, digs through the
tissue, checks to make sure they are both the same size.
Satisfied, he heads for bed...
BEN
Back in action.

Thank God.

INT CTF OFFICES - THE NEXT MORNING - JAY Z PLAYS OVER
VARIOUS ANGLES: Rows of Young Employees at their computers,
wearing headsets. Huge flat screens flash images of models.
Young faces - everywhere. We’re seeing all these details
THROUGH BEN’S EYES as he TAKES A TOUR of the OFFICES.
JASON, tall, off-beat-cute, mid-twenties leads FOUR NEW
INTERNS through the massive space.
The New Interns are: Ben, DORIS, early 70’s, 4’11”, VICTOR,
Black, professorial-looking and a new Young Intern -- DAVIS,
in his twenties and thrilled to be here.
JASON
-- So, Interns, all of CTF, is on
this one floor and that’s because
we’re all about communication and
teamwork. Everyone works in cubes.
No one has an office, not even our
founder and CEO, Jules Ostin. Who
is actually right over there.

18.
Jason points across the office to Jules sitting stationary on
her bike, talking on her iPhone.
JASON (cont’d)
She loves to ride her bike through
the office. That woman does not
like to waste time plus she counts
it as exercise.
DORIS
That’s adorable.
JASON
(biting his tongue)
Yes it is.
Ben looks over at Jules just as she notices the Senior
Interns and just as quickly turns away from them.
DAVIS
(to Ben)
How ya doin’?
(extends his hand)
I’m Davis.
BEN
(shakes his hand)
Hey Davis. Ben Whittaker.
place, huh?

Exciting

DAVIS
Oh my God, they had one opening for
a regular age intern -- no offense,
and I got it. I’m so psyched.
BEN
I’m pretty psyched myself.
Some of the Young Employees pass by, checking out our group.
JASON
New interns.
(the Kids laugh)
Hey, gray is the new green.
(walking backwards)
A few words about Jules. No, wait,
I’ll let her talk for herself.
Jason POINTS A REMOTE at A FLAT SCREEN.
featuring Jules in the CTF offices.

A VIDEO begins

JULES
I’m Jules Ostin and I started
clothesthatfit in 2011 after I
worked for another on-line shopping
site and couldn’t help but notice
that almost 50% of all dresses and
(MORE)

19.
JULES (cont'd)
pants were returned with one common
comment. It didn’t fit! I read the
words “It didn’t fit” in at least
15 different languages.
The words “It didn’t fit” pop on the screen in 15 different
languages -- all handwritten.
JULES (cont’d)
It’s pretty impossible to know from
a photo if something’s right for
you, especially when the models are
all 5’10 and 100 pounds...
(A Photo of a tall, slinky
model pops up with an X
over her)
So I started CTF to let women know
how something’s really going to fit
before you buy it. Buying clothes
on-line should be about more than
making the return easy -- it should
be all about being thrilled with
your purchase.
A PHOTO of JULES SITTING AT HER KITCHEN TABLE in front of her
laptop, surrounded by racks of clothes.
JULES (cont’d)
I started CTF in my kitchen
eighteen months ago. It was just
me, a model and a photographer, we
were all women and we tried on
everything we sold.
(QUICK PHOTOS of all 3
trying on clothes, then
sitting at computers)
Then we described the fit to save
you the hassle.
We see WHAT THEY’VE TYPED: “Got boobs? This dress is for
you!” “Snug fit but super-cool!” “This dress fits everyone!
We all just bought one!”
JULES (cont’d)
We called it human curation, then
we mixed that with technology
and four months later we were
launched and now we have 250 people
working with us here in Brooklyn
and we’re still growing!
BEN
(to himself)
Wow...

20.
JASON
(clicks off the video)
Okay, a quick who’s who around
here.
DAVIS
So, Ben, you gonna wear a suit
everyday?
You bet.

BEN

DAVIS
Like that confidence. Plus you got
the gangsta thing goin’. Very cool.
JASON
(continuing the tour)
-- These 3 rows are our Marketing
Team, they do everything from online marketing to Google search
engine optimizaton, followed by
Creative - they work on how the
site looks and feels then our
Merchandisers, Copy and Copy
Editing...
DORIS
(to Victor)
-- So far, I’ve understood nothing.
JASON
And these four rows are our
resident rock stars -(rows of exhausted Geeks)
Our Tech Team. They keep us up and
running 24/7 ‘cause those are our
store hours. And this corner of
prime real estate is the
illustrious Intern Team. Guys, meet
the new Interns.
Six or so scruffy, overworked, very young Interns in dopey Tshirts stop what they’re doing and look at the new, well
dressed Interns. Neither gets the group they’re about to
become part of. Ben shakes hands with the Intern closest to
him and that begins everyone shaking hands.
JASON (cont’d)
Okay, very nice. Last thing. Our
perks. We have a free lunch every
day, an in-house massage therapist
and a world class gym one floor
below. New interns, grab a desk,
check your e-mail, you may find
you’ve been assigned to one
particular person or one team or
you may just be a floater. It’s

JASON (cont’d)
all good. And remember, with great
power, comes great responsibility
and that’s why we love being
interns.
Davis sits at a desk, takes out his iPhone, an iPad mini, a
flash drive, opens up his computer
Ben finds an empty desk, sits at it and although the
atmosphere is foreign, he takes enormous pleasure in once
again, sitting behind a desk. Ben opens his well worn
briefcase, takes out a new Pen and Pencil set, a small
leather-bound pad, a flip phone, a travel clock.
LEWIS, a scrawny sleepy-looking Intern with big hair, sits
across from Ben -- watching him.
Ben takes out his lucky Pocket Calculator, then an Eyeglass
Case, then another eyeglass case. He slips on his bifocals,
raises his neck and looks down at the CTF Screen Saver.
Ben stares at the keyboard, not sure what to do when he
becomes aware he’s being watched. He looks over, sees Lewis
eyeing him. Lewis decides to help him out by showing him to
hit the space bar on his key board.
BEN follows, hits his space bar. The computer turns on and a
lot of icons pop up that don’t look familiar. Lewis helps
out again by moving his mouse to the Mail Icon, Clicks. Ben
catches on and does the same.
BEN
Oh. Got one.
AN E-MAIL - FROM CANDICE COOK - SUBJECT:

WELCOME BEN!

Congratulations. You’re internship will be directly with our
Founder, Jules Ostin. Becky Scott will contact you with a
time to meet Jules. Look forward to meeting you!
Just as Ben computes this he HEARS:
DORIS
I’m in the Photo Studio!
VICTOR
Business Analytics. Perfect.
DAVIS
Floater. Love!!!
All eyes turn to Ben.
BEN
Looks like I’m a personal intern.

22.

Nice.

JASON
To...?

BEN
Jules... Ostin.
LEWIS
(shakes his head, then to
himself)
Unfortunate.
Jason crosses to Ben, leans over, hugs him, goes back to his
desk.
PING.

Ben gets another email.

Hi Ben. I have secured an appointment for you to meet Jules
Ostin today at 3:55 pm. Please be prompt as Jules has
another meeting at 4 pm. Thanks! Becky Scott.
BEN reacts to that.

A five minute meeting. Wow.

DAVIS
(rises)
Goin’ to Merchandising.
Beautiful.

BEN

Davis offers Ben his fist. Ben pounds it. Awkwardly. Ben
notices a Young Woman has come to get Doris. Ben glances
around the office, no one is idle. He spots Jules in her
Conference Room talking to a large group.
Ben’s eyes go to his CLOCK. It’s 10:02. It’s a long time
‘til 3:55. As CAMERA PULLS UP AND AWAY, we see everyone on
the floor is busy while Ben waits patiently to meet the Boss.
CLOSE - BECKY - 3:54 P.M.
Becky’s desk is overloaded with work, her half eaten lunch
still sits on her desk.
BECKY
(frazzled, into headset)
- I’ll try to have her there at
five. Oh, wait, I booked her with a
Vendor at 4:45. Let me work on
this.
(takes an Advil, chokes on
it)
Call you back.
(looks up to Ben)
Yes? Hello.

23.
BEN
Hi. I’m Ben.
(doesn’t ring a bell)
Whittaker. I have a 3:55
appointment with Miss Ostin.
BECKY
(scans computer)
3:55? I thought she was meeting
with her new intern.
BEN
That’s me.
(Becky turns to him)
How ya doin’?
BECKY
I’m sorry, but how are you an
intern?
BEN
It’s a Senior Intern Program. Just
started today.
BECKY
Oh my God. How’s that going to
work?
(whispers)
How old are you?
Seventy.

BEN
You?

BECKY
Twenty four. I know I look older.
It’s the job. It ages you, which
won’t be great in your case. Sorry.
BEN
I actually thought you looked
younger.
BECKY
Yeah, right.
BEN
Any tips before I go in?
BECKY
-- Just talk fast, she hates slow
talkers. Or maybe that’s just when
I talk slow. Just don’t dawdle, in
any way. Keep it moving and don’t
forget to blink.
(Ben reacts. Blink?)
She hates when people don’t blink.
It weirds her out. It’s 3:57, this

your five-The Conference Room DOOR OPENS and Ben watches a group exit.
BECKY (cont’d)
You’re up! Go!
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM
Jules is typing on her laptop, her hair thrown up in a pony
tail. Ben arrives in the doorway, waits for her to
acknowledge him. She doesn’t.
BEN
Hi Jules... I’m Ben.
(Jules looks up)
Your new “intern”.
JULES
I’m glad you also see the humor in
this.
BEN
Be hard not to.
(BLINKS!)
JULES
So, Ben I was going to say what’s a
nice guy like you doing in a place
like this but Candice gave me the
drill so can I just be honest with
you?
Please.

BEN

JULES
I’m not going to have a lot for you
to do.
(Ben’s surprised)
That’s the truth. And, you being
assigned to me is kind of just for
me to, you know, set an example for
the rest of the team. If you ask
me, I think you’d probably be much
better off working in creative or
marketing. It’s a little slower
pace. Maybe a little easier to
grasp. If you requested a transfer,
we could make that happen. Okay?
BEN
If that’s what you prefer.

25.
JULES
You’ll be happier, believe me.
not so fun to work for.

I’m

BEN
That’s what I gather.
(Jules looks up)
But I can get along with anybody
and I’m here to learn about your
world, be of help where I can so...
JULES
-- You’re saying you don’t want to
be transferred?
BEN
Not really, Sir.
(mortified)
Excuse me. Terribly sorry.
(big blink)
JULES
(kind of laughs)
It’s not like that’s the first time
that’s happened. Okay then. Well,
looks like you’re stuck with me.
(returns to her laptop)
BEN
Great. I’m excited.
His smile and enthusiasm throws Jules.
JULES
I’ll e-mail you when I have
something for you to do.
BEN
Or I could just stop by a few times
a day, check in.
JULES
I’ll e-mail you. And don’t think
you need to dress up, we’re super
informal here.
BEN
I’m comfortable in a suit, so if
it’s okay.
JULES
No, sure, it’s fine.

Old school.

BEN
Exactly. At least I’ll stand out.

26.
JULES
I don’t think you’ll need a suit to
do that.
BEN
True. Well, I think we did it in
under two minutes. I’ll wait to
hear from you.
(crosses to the door)
Would you like the door open or
closed?
JULES
Doesn’t matter.
Ben exits, CLOSING the door behind him.
JULES (cont’d)
Open. Actually.
Ben opens it back up, slips a last look at Jules.
JULES (CONT’D) (cont’d)
You’ll get used to me.
BEN
Look forward to it.
INT. BEN’S BATHROOM - THAT NIGHT
Ben, in his pj’s, stands in front of the mirror and dumps out
all the pills in the “Monday” compartment of his 7 Day Pill
Organizer. He catches his reflection and practices blinking.
INT. CTF OFFICES - THE NEXT MORNING
Ben sits at his desk, reading The Times. Everyone around him
is crazy-busy. The tech-talk is so intense, Ben literally
can’t understand a word of it. Jason passes, speed typing on
his phone.
JASON
Ben! You good?
BEN
(gives OK sign)
Perf.
Jason laughs. Ben checks his e-mail.

Doesn’t have any.

27.
A ROW OF VENDING MACHINES
Ben is trying to figure out where to put his money in the ecofriendly interactive vending machine. A Young Guy comes
along, taps on the panel, takes out an apple.
It’s free.

GUY

Ben tries touching the screen. Nothing happens. Tries again.
IN THE AFTERNOON
Ben is at his computer, getting familiar with the CTF site.
He looks over his bifocals and sees the ELEVATOR DOORS
CLOSING with Jules inside. He rolls his chair back, looks
out the window and sees A DRIVER standing next to an SUV,
stomp out a cigarette. Jules EXITS THE BUILDING and heads
toward the car.
SEVEN P.M.
The office is emptying for the night. Davis, slips on his
jacket, heading out.
DAVIS
You’re staying?
BEN
(indicates Jules at her
desk)
Can’t leave before the boss leaves,
Davis.
Davis gives Ben a gangsta handshake that Ben stumbles
through.
DAVIS
We’ll work on that.
Ben clicks on his e-mail one last time.

Still nothing.

INT. BEN’S HOUSE - THE NEXT A.M.
Ben’s TWO ALARM CLOCKS go off within a second of one another.
We find Ben sitting in a chair, fully dressed, ready to go.
BEN
(rises)
Let’s make it happen!
INT. OFFICES - THE NEXT MORNING
Kiko, the one Young Female Intern, PULLS A HUGE DOLLY stacked
with reams of printer paper down a row of cubicles. She’s
delivering the paper to each desk. Guys in the office scoot

28.
past her as she lugs the dolly forward, Ben arrives to help,
pushing the dolly for her.
BEN (cont’d)
I’ll push, you deliver.
KIKO
Thank you!!!
JULES - ON THE PHONE AT HER DESK
notices Ben pushing the dolly as he and Kiko quickly deliver
the paper. She also notices Ben is getting smiles and thanks
from many of the Young Women he passes.
LATER - AT DAVIS’ DESK
Ben and Davis look at data on Davis’s screen.
BEN
Okay, so they want to know what
customers bought who didn’t come
back - so they can spot the
problem, if there is one, right?
DAVIS
Yeah, but I don’t get how to...
BEN
-- Alright, here’s how I think we
should do this.
JASON
(joining them)
-- Okay, Ben, here she comes, watch
how she won’t...
(Becky heads in their
direction)
-- Hey, Beck, what’s up? You look
really nice tod-Becky walks right past, ignoring him. Jason turns to Ben.
JASON (CONT’D) (cont’d)
How long can a woman be mad at you
for?
BEN
Kind of depends on what you did.
JASON
First of all, nothing on purpose.
We were going out for a minute, she
was cool...I really liked her...
(confidentially)
-- then I... like sort of had sex

JASON (cont'd)
with her roommate.
(Ben winces)
I had no idea she was her roommate.
Met her out. How would I know?
Ben notices A STRIKING WOMAN, late fifties or sixty, crossing
through the office. She has a natural look, soft clothes,
soft hair, and a warm comfortable confidence.
JASON (CONT’D) (cont’d)
Ben, you have a lot of experience,
how long will she be mad at me for?
DAVIS
Jay, I have zero experience and I
can tell you there’s no coming back
from this one.
BEN
I assume you’ve talked to her,
apologized, told her what she means
to you.
(Jason stalls...)
You didn’t talk to her? What did
you do? Send her a tweet?
JASON
No. Of course not. I texted her,
like a billion times, she didn’t
answer, then I e-mailed her, but
you know, like a nice e-mail, a
long one.
(Ben looks at Jason over
his bifocals. That’s all
it takes)
I should probably just actually
speak to her.
(to himself)
Obviously.
BEN
Can’t imagine it would hurt.
Jason nervously nods, pats Ben on the back. Ben tries to
find the Pretty Woman again, but she’s nowhere to be found.
LATER - JULES AND CANDICE CROSS THROUGH THE OFFICE
JULES
Did yesterday’s numbers come in?
Candice looks through a stack of papers she’s holding as
Jules washes her hands with Purell. Jules SQUINTS across the
room SPOTTING BEN pitching with a Young Copy Writer. She
types as he talks.

30.
JULES (cont’d)
My intern sure keeps busy.
CANDICE
Mr. Congeniality. Big hit. Everyone
loves him.
Jules washes her hands again with Purell.
CANDICE (cont’d)
You just did that. You’re going to
wash the skin off your hands.
Candice hands Jules a print out as Jules pauses at the
cubicle that’s been turned into the community junk pile. It
so clearly annoys her, and to make things worse, someone
drops a case of water on the chair.
JULES
Okay? Seriously?
LATER - BEN TAKES A SEAT IN HIS CUBICLE
clicks on his e-mail, leans forward - shocked.
has one. Subject -- NEED YOU!

He actually

BECKY’S DESK
Ben awaits his orders. As always, Becky is on her headset,
overwhelmed, juggling a zillion things.
BECKY
(to Ben)
-- Jules spilled soy sauce on her
Stella McCartney jacket, can you
take it to the photo studio, they
have all kinds of cleaners and
stuff in there.
Sure.

BEN
Where’s the jacket?

BECKY
(duh?)
She’s wearing it!
(Ben hesitates)
Go in and get it!
(into headset)
I’m sorry. You need the proofs back
by when?

31.
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM
Candice and Jules are clearly in the middle of something
important. Leftover sushi sits between them.
JULES
Wow. I did not see this coming. But
I should have.... They want me to
bring in a CEO? Why? Because they
think I’m... what? Too
inexperienced at running a
business...
(Candice almost nods)
Didn’t go to Harvard...?
(Candice tries not to nod)
My work habits aren’t by the
book..? I mean, isn’t that how we
got here? Really? I need adult
supervision? Jesus, I’m the oldest
one in the whole office! How do you
feel about this? Tell me the truth.
CANDICE
I think it’s worth exploring.
JULES
Why? Could we be doing better?
hit our five year goal in nine
months.

We

CANDICE
Exactly. Jules, we can’t keep up
with our own success. You know
that. You’re an hour late to every
meeting. We have a name for it.
Jules Standard Time. And I get it,
there’s just so many hours in the
day. We’re all playing catch-up.
Our tech guys are working ‘til two,
three in the morning. Customer
Service is swamped. We’re running
out of inventory. We have shipping
issues, programming problems. And
the bigger we get, the more
complicated it’s gonna get. And
honestly, your time can be better
spent than worrying about so much
minutia. How much time did we
spend last week setting up the L.A.
warehouse? And because you were
doing that, we never met all week
with engineering...
JULES
Isn’t this what a start up is?
(sees Candice is about to
say something)
(MORE)

32.
JULES (cont'd)
-- What? Say it. What’s everyone
worried about?
CANDICE
That it’s all going so fast, it can
get away from us. The VC’s think a
seasoned CEO will take things off
your plate -- that’s all -- free
you up to do what you do great. You
come up with the ideas and let
someone else make the trains run on
time.
(Jules hates this)
They’re not only our investors,
Jules, they’re our partners -- they
do want what’s best for us. They
want us to make it.
JULES
But Candice, that new person is
going to run things their way.
Technically be my boss. How can I
do what I do and have to report to
someone else, run every idea I have
by this person? Can you see that
working?
CANDICE
Gilt Groupe brought in a CEO, how
are they doing?
JULES
I know, but, for me this is...
I mean get me CEO lessons, but
don’t...
(her eyes fill up with
tears)
BEN O.S.
-- Excuse me.
Candice and Jules turn to see Ben standing in the doorway.
Jules quickly recovers.
BEN
I apologize but Becky said you
needed something taken care of...on
your jacket...
JULES
Oh, right-Keeping her face turned away, Jules takes off her jacket,
slides it down the table, then quickly dabs at her eyes. Ben
catches the jacket, pretends not to see her tears.

33.
CANDICE
Thanks Ben.
(Ben nods, EXITS)
The VC’s made up a list of
potential CEO’s. Let’s look at the
list, explore it, then decide. Baby
steps.
Jules struggles with how to respond.
BECKY’S DESK
Ben passes by with Jules's jacket.

Becky stops typing.

BECKY
Something big going on in there?
BEN
I couldn’t say.
BECKY
You were in there a long time.
BEN
(touches his left ear)
I can’t hear a thing.
Becky doesn’t believe him.
her typing.

He doesn’t give.

She returns to

Ben spots Jason nearby mouthing: “Say something about me to
her!!!” Ben gestures he should come over himself. Becky
looks up. Ben covers. Becky wonders why Ben is still
hanging around.
BEN (cont’d)
On my way, boss.
INT. OFFICES - END OF THE DAY
As Ben packs up his briefcase, he notices Jules sitting alone
in the Conference Room. She wipes the corner of her eye,
turns her back to the room.
LEWIS
Hey Ben. Ben?
(Ben turns)
How old’s that briefcase?
Ben looks down at his well worn, very loved briefcase.
BEN
It’s a 1973 Dunhill London Two
Buckle. They don’t make this one
anymore.

34.
LEWIS
(eyeing it)
I’m a little in love with it.
BEN
It’s a classic, Lewis. Unbeatable.
Ben turns his attention back to Jules and sees her leaving
the conference room, wearing her sunglasses. She heads for
the elevator, clearly in a funk.
Ben takes this in, snaps his briefcase shut.
EXT. CTF - THE FOLLOWING MORNING - ESTABLISHING
INT. OFFICES
Jules makes her way through the office, still in her
sunglasses, carrying her iPad, holding a Starbucks. As she
passes the desk usually piled high with everyone’s crap she
stops short. It is now a cleaned up perfectly empty cube.
Those around her watch her react.
JULES
Okay, this is thrilling.
A few people nearby laugh.

Jules takes off her sunglasses.

JULES (cont’d)
I swear I was going stay late and
do this myself.
ALI
Ben came in at 7 this morning and
did it.
Who?

JULES

A few others look up.
Ben.

She doesn’t know him?

ALI
Your intern.

Jules cranes her neck to find Ben, doesn’t even know where to
look. Candice watches from her desk and hits the P.A.
CANDICE
(over the P.A.)
Ben Whittaker!
WIDE - A SEA of CUBICLES
BEN’S HEAD RISES OUT OF HIS CUBE, wondering what’s up.

35.
JULES
(spots him - points to the
clean cubicle)
Brilliant! Thank you! Best thing
that’s happened around here all
week.
Ben raises two fingers to his forehead, saluting her from
across the room. The entire office applauds.
MOMENTS LATER
Ben is on-line at his desk when a LOVELY PAIR OF HANDS begin
massaging his shoulders.
WOMAN O.S.
This is your gift for a job well
done.
Ben turns, looks up and there she is -- The beautiful Woman
he spotted days ago, across the room. She speaks with an
English accent and smells like lavender. She rubs his
shoulders.
WOMAN
I’m Fiona -- the house masseuse.
This feel okay?
BEN
Feels great actually. Thank you.
FIONA
You’re a bit tight, Ben.
BEN
Haven’t sat at a desk for a while.
My body’s not used to it.
FIONA
I get it, plus they say “sitting”
is the new smoking. Let me see what
I can do.
Ben inhales deeply as she massages him. Feels good. Lewis
and Davis smile to one another. Ben’s a happy guy.
FIONA (cont’d)
I spotted you the other day, in the
lunch room.
(Ben can’t believe that)
Then someone told me you were an
intern. So clever of you to do
this.

36.
BEN
It’s a brave new world. Thought I’d
jump in, see what it’s all about.
FIONA
(pulls up a chair, reaches
under Ben’s jacket)
Absolutely. I’m constantly amazed
at what they do here. Love being
part of it.
As Fiona slides her hands down Ben’s back and toward his bum,
Ben’s eyes go wide.
Davis and Lewis sit on either side of Ben. Lewis’s eyes
widen, then he indicates Ben’s crotch. Davis checks it out.
Whoa. Big Ben. He definitely has an erection.
FIONA (cont’d)
Feeling better?
BEN
(barely able to speak)
Much.
Davis tosses a newspaper on Ben’s lap.
DAVIS
Here you go.
Ben nods appreciatively, nervously spreads out the paper.
Fiona straightens out Ben’s jacket, a final rub on the
shoulders.
FIONA
Great to meet you. Love that
there’s another oldie but goodie
here.
(hands him her card)
See you again?
Love to.

BEN

And with a final pat on Ben’s shoulders, she’s off. Ben
watches her go, then puts a fist out on either side and both
boys pound him.
BEN, DAVIS AND LEWIS WALKING THRU THE OFFICE
The Boys are returning from lunch.
LEWIS
So, wait, you’re saying you shave
every day of your life -- even on
Sundays and even if you know you’re

- LATER

37.
LEWIS (cont'd)
not going to see anyone you know...
(Ben rolls his eyes)
DAVIS
(reads his iPhone)
How is this possible? I’m on
cheapapartments.com and I literally
can’t afford a single apartment in
all of Brooklyn.
(scans the site)
My parents gave me two weeks to
find a place and that is just not
going to happen.
BEN
Getting evicted?
DAVIS
Hey, I’m in no rush but apparently
they are.
Something catches Ben’s attention OUT THE WINDOW. He moves
closer, sees JULES'S DRIVER, tucked in an alley, drinking
from a paper bag then stashing the bottle in his pocket. He
seems to have a slight balance problem when he tries to
answer his cell.
Ben turns, LOOKS FOR JULES - SEES her slipping on her jacket.
EXT. BUILDING
The Driver, MIKE, stands by the SUV, popping a couple of
Chiclets in his mouth. Ben approaches, a bit out of breath.
BEN
Hey, how’s it goin’?
Yeah.

Mike, right?

MIKE

BEN
I’m Ben, I work for Jules.
MIKE
(not much eye contact)
She’ll be down in a minute.
BEN
I know, look, I don’t want to make
you uncomfortable but I just
happened to have looked out the
window and it appeared you were
drinking something from a bag, so --

38.
MIKE
(heading for the car)
I don’t know what you’re talking
about Pops.
BEN
(sees Jules heading out)
Why don’t you tell Jules you can’t
drive her today or I’m gonna have
to.
Jules arrives, sees Mike and Ben.
JULES
(to Mike)
We all good?
Yeah.

MIKE

Mike opens the rear passenger door, Jules gets in. As Mike is
about to close the door, he looks up, sees Ben has moved
closer.
MIKE (cont’d)
-- Jules...
(She looks up at him)
Sorry to do this, but I’m actually
not feelin’ so hot -- not sure I
should be driving. Wouldn’t want to
give you anything.
JULES
Oh, sure, yeah. No, take the day
off and feel better, okay?
Mike thanks Jules and EXITS. Jules immediately washes her
hands with Purell, checks her watch.
BEN (O.S.)
I’m happy to cover for Mike..

at the open door, holding
the car keys)
That’s okay, Becky can drive me.
Really?

BEN
You want to give her more

INT. SUV - MOVING - DAY
Ben is now behind the wheel.

JULES
(typing on her iPad)
Hope you don’t mind if I don’t get
in the front. Not trying to be
rude but I think better in the
back. I mean, I could get in the
front but...
BEN
(stopping her)
-- This is perfect.
JULES
(reading her iPad)
Yeah.
(cell RINGS)
And everything you hear in the car
is strictly confidential, okay?
BEN
Goes without sayin’.
JULES
(answers cell)
Hi Mom...
She places the call on SPEAKERPHONE while typing on her iPad.
JULES'S MOM (O.S.)
I found you!
JULES
Yeah... What’s up? How’s
everything?
JULES'S MOM
Everything’s comin’ along. Your Dad
and I are finally putting together
all our research at the hospital.
JULES
(typing)
That great...
JULES'S MOM
I hear you typing...
(Jules types more softly)
We’ve been studying women under 40
who sleep less than six hours a
night...
JULES
(suddenly interested)
And? What’d you find out?

40.
JULES'S MOM
Seems they’re approximately 38%
more likely to experience major
weight gain and 11% more likely to
become obese compared with women
who slept 7 hours a night.
JULES
(looks down at herself)
Are you kidding me! You know I
haven’t slept in two years.
JULES'S MOM
I can’t change the facts, dear.
JULES
(typing)
Look, Mom, I’m rushing into the
city for a meeting and I need to
prepare. Can I call you when I get
home?
JULES'S MOM
You don’t have to.
Okay.

JULES
Love you.

Thank you.

JULES'S MOM

Ben can’t help but react to that. Jules looks into the rear
view mirror. Ben’s eyes are steady on the road.
PING. Jules clicks on Face Time on her iPad. It’s Candice.
CANDICE
How we doing? Did you look over
the material on Sheekey?
JULES
I did... CMO Travelocity,
Citigroup... I get it. He’s major.
CANDICE
He is. And the best thing about him
is he’s been watching us and he
loves what we’re doing. But he’s
only one of the names on the list,
so if you don’t like him, we move
on. But try to be open. He’s
supposed to be kind of brilliant
and the VC’s love him. A lot.

41.
JULES
Acchhh. Mark Zuckerberg never
brought in a CEO. And he was a
teenager.
Ben agrees.

Tries not to nod.

Jules notices.

CANDICE
Call me after!
BEN OPENS JULES'S CAR DOOR
We’re on PARK AVENUE.

Jules steps out of the car.

JULES
This shouldn’t take more than an
hour, if you can’t stay here, I’ll
call Becky and she’ll find you,
then just pull up and-BEN
--I’ll be here.
Oh.

JULES

(almost to herself)
I think I forgot to eat today.
BEN
Should I pick you up some sushi?
JULES
No, I eat too much mercury. I’ll be
fine. I’m good. I’m also kinda
nauseous, so...
Jules's eyes go up to the skyscraper in front of her, then
looks to Ben, a bit self-conscious. Ben gives her a “go get
‘em” kind of fist-move. She acknowledges it, nods.
INT. PLUSH OFFICE SUITE - MOMENTS LATER
Jules follows an Assistant down a long corridor. She’s
nervous, her palm hitting the side of her leg, heart
pounding. The Assistant shows her into a large office where
ERIC SHEEKEY stands with his back to the door. He hangs up
from a call and turns in Jules’s direction.
Jules catches Eric’s ready smile and dimples he’s a bit too
proud of. They shake hands but all Jules sees is:
ERIC’S HAIR. He uses a product that gives him a wet look. One
strand strategically falls on his forehead.

42.

Jules!

ERIC

Because of Jules’s state of mind, she catches only PIECES of
what Eric says. JUMP CUTS tell the story.
ERIC (cont’d)
Congratulations. You are a great
merchant and a passionate
visionary.
(Jules forces a smile)
But let’s look at where you are
from 30,000 feet, shall we?
(Jules is finding it hard
to swallow)
You’ve had your arms wrapped around
the business really well -- until
the last two quarters. But what
everyone wants is a long term
sustainable business and at this
point, we still need hyper-growth.
So what’s the plan to make that
happen for CTF?
Jules starts to answer but a cough comes out instead. Eric
pours water from a sleek water pitcher and holds the pitcher
up a little too high, the water flowing in slow mo, right
into the glass.
We both know 90% of all tech
companies fail so you’re going to
need me, or someone like me to get
you over this hump. We also know
mobile is the future... you need a
plan for that and you needed it six
months ago.
(hands Jules the glass of
water)
-- You have relentless
perseverance, Jules, I’ll give you
that, but that’s not enough to get
you where you need to be. My role
will be to keep my head out of the
cyclone, provide insight, direction
and stability. I’ve been right here
before.
(Jules shifts her
position)
Now I have some great people I’d
like to bring over with me -- very
smart, very pedigree’d. Different
level.
(Jules wipes her upper lip
- different level???)
I guarantee you by next quarter we
will do far more than make the
trains at CTF run on time.
(MORE)

43.
(cont'd)
(Jules drinks the water)
I’ve watched what you’re doing
Jules and it’s exciting. Your
obsessive focus on the customer
serves you well, I see it in all
the data, but the money’s never
there until it’s there. So, take
the next step, strengthen your
infrastructure and make some
changes -- and next year at this
time, you’ll be killing it and
right where you should be -hangin’ with the big boys. That’s a
promise.
As Eric ends his speech his eyes land on Jules's thigh -- her
skirt has hiked up a little too far. Jules catches his look.
He doesn’t have the decency to look away.
JULES - WALKING QUICKLY - EXT. BUILDING PLAZA
CAMERA rushes to keep up with her. She stops at the curb,
her eyes searching when the SUV pulls right up to her.
SLAM
Jules, safe in the backseat of the car, catches her breath.
BEN
That was fast.
JULES
Not fast enough.
Jules Purells her hands, notices a brown bag next to her
seat. Opens it.
BEN
I picked you up some soup from a
place I know.
JULES
Thanks, really, you didn’t...
(opens the bag)
-- Oh, it smells so good.
Jules opens the container, dips in the spoon, has some.
JULES (cont’d)
Highlight of my day.
Jules phone RINGS. She hits speaker.
JULES (cont’d)
Word travels fast.

44.
CANDICE (O.S.)
Pretty short meeting.
JULES
Yeah. I hated him.
Ben reacts.
CANDICE (O.S.)
Really? I heard he’s so wonderful.
JULES
He is -- in a loathsome sort of
way.
Ben tries not to smile.
CANDICE (O.S.)
What went wrong?
JULES
I thought he was a condescending
sexist know-it-all who did not seem
to get what we do, at all, and
honestly, I think he’d run our
company in a completely inorganic
way that would lose us all the
customers we’ve killed ourselves to
get. And I also think he’d replace
us as soon as he could. Swear to
God. And worst of all -- never
blinked. An Olympian non-blinker.
CANDICE (O.S.)
Okay, then.
JULES
Yeah...
(eats her soup, Candice
waits)
Did you hear my idea about putting
bows on the boxes, based on that
gift thing that customer said. That
would be good, right?
CANDICE (O.S.)
We have a dozen ribbons on your
desk to pick from.
JULES
Thanks...
(Jules softens)
See you in the a.m.?
CANDICE (O.S.)
Be there or be square.

45.

I’m sorry.
Don’t be.

JULES
CANDICE (O.S.)

Ben nods to himself. He looks in the rear view mirror. Jules
leans back, closing her eyes.
EXT. PARK SLOPE - SUNSET
The SUV pulls up in front of a beautiful but aging townhouse.
This 19th Century facade is lean and white with a tall black
door.
JULES
(as she gets out)
Thanks for helping out with Mike
today and getting me chicken soup -Oh, and cleaning up that
cubicle...that was awesome.
Seriously.
BEN
You’re very welcome.
Ben starts to say something, decides not to.
the passenger window, peers in.

Jules moves to

JULES
-- It’s okay. I really won’t bite.
BEN
You started this business a year
and a half ago by yourself and now
you have a staff of 250 people.
Remember who did that.
Who?

JULES
I’m kidding. Thank you.

BEN
And I hate to say it but -- try to
get some sleep.
Jules smiles in a very tired kind of way. Ben watches as
Jules climbs the stairs to her front door. The DOOR OPENS
and to Ben’s surprise Jules's FAMILY GREETS HER.
Newly energized, Jules runs to greet her 4 year old daughter,
PAIGE. Paige flies into Jules's arms. Ben watches, a bit
struck that Jules is a Mom. He had no idea.
Behind Paige is Jules's husband, MATT, in jeans, t-shirt,
open flannel shirt. Matt has an adorable smile and an
immediate feeling of authenticity about him.

46.
Jules turns back, waves good night to Ben.

Ben waves back.

BEN (cont’d)
(driving off)
Over the hump.
INT. JULES'S TOWNHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
The house is partially under construction. Jules carries
Paige into:
THE KITCHEN
The only room downstairs that’s been finished. Long open
shelves, an island, a farm table. Pots and pans are on the
stove. Play-doh spread across the island.
PAIGE
Guess what? Maddie said she didn’t
want to be my friend anymore.
JULES
Oh, I don’t think she means that,
she’d miss you too much.
(Paige nods, agreeing)
MATT
(hands Jules a glass of
wine)
I’m convinced Maddie is bipolar.
We go through this every other day.
How was your meeting? It was
today, right?
JULES
(sipping the wine)
Just had it.
PAIGE
(indicating play-doh)
Daddy, can we finish?
MATT
Let me talk to Mommy for a sec.
PAIGE
Mommy I think I’m winning, look!
Matt and Paige are in a Play-Doh Cake Challenge.
JULES
Which one is yours, let me guess.
(Paige smiles at Matt)
Well, I love the pink one so much --

47.
PAIGE
That’s mine! Are you happy at me?
JULES
So happy at you. Beyond happy at
you!
PAIGE
Daddy helped me with the icing.
JULES
Good job guys.
So, what’s for
din, it smells so good.
PAIGE
Turkey burgers. But we ate ours.
MATT
Sorry. We were starved.
PAIGE
We were. But we’ll sit with you,
don’t worry.
JULES
Thank you angel. How ‘bout I give
you your bath first.
MATT
(doing dishes)
-- Wait. Tell me, I was waiting for
you to call. Did you like the guy
or..?
JULES
Thought he wasn’t the right fit.
For me. Kinda scary actually.
(Matt looks disappointed)
There’s a lot more names on the
list, so...
Matt nods as Jules ponders why he’d want this.
INT. BEN’S KITCHEN - SAME TIME
Ben takes leftovers out of the fridge. A Django Reinhardt CD
plays while Anderson Cooper is on mute. Ben is clearly
feeling upbeat as he playfully hits his Voice Mail on his
phone.
Ben!

MILES (O.S.)
Haven’t seen you in days.

BEN
That’s right, homey, Ben’s got a
job!

48.
Next -- Patty, the woman Ben ran into at Trader Joe’s.
PATTY (O.S.)
Oh, you’re never home! What are y-Never mind! Oh. It’s Patty!
(CLICK)
Ben laughs, then digs in his pocket, brings out Fiona’s card.
He crosses to the phone, thinks for a sec, then dials,
quickly pouring himself a drink and taking a sip -- but she
answers too quickly.
BEN
(swallows fast, then)
Fiona, hi. This is Ben Whittaker
from -- Oh, good to hear your
voice too...
(Ben makes a victory fist)
INT. PAIGE’S BEDROOM - LATER THAT EVENING
Paige is still awake but under the covers. The light is dim.
Next to her, Jules is asleep, with one of Paige’s books open
against her chest. Matt steps in the doorway.
MATT
(softly)
Jules?
PAIGE
Sh-sh... let her sleep, Dad.
Matt sees that Jules is out cold then covers his
disappointment in front of Paige.
INT. MATT AND JULES'S BEDROOM - 11 PM
Jules ENTERS and finds Matt asleep. She feels badly she’s
missed their evening -- she clicks off Kimmel, crosses to her
side of the bed, gets under the covers. She lifts her laptop onto her lap, checks her e-mail.
MATT
I tried to stay up.
JULES
I know. I’m sorry I fell asleep in
there. I passed out.
(Matt doesn’t answer,
could be back asleep)
I know we had a plan to have a
grown-up conversation tonight.
(Matt opens one eye)
Do you understand what’s happening
in Yemen? I’m kidding... I mean, I
(MORE)

49.
JULES (cont'd)
don’t understand it, but...
(Matt shuts his eyes)
Want to Netflix something?
Silence. Disappointed, she resumes typing.
MATT
Sorry. Fell out for a sec. Paige
learned to say “humongous” today.
Cracks me up. But I think I’m ready
for her to start school full time.
I hate to sound like the other Moms
but I’m feeling I need a little
“me” time.
I know...

JULES

She waits. He doesn’t answer. Seems to be back asleep. He
turns on his side, AWAY FROM HER.
Jules moves her computer off her lap, sidles up behind Matt,
kisses his neck. No response.
JULES (cont’d)
Anybody home?
MATT
Can’t keep my eyes open, Jule.
We’ll do it tomorrow, k?
JULES
(moving back to her side)
How many nights in a row has one of
us said that?
Matt turns to Jules, takes her hand. She looks at him,
hopefully.
MATT
Can you turn out your light?
Jules turns out her light. The Screen goes BLACK.
INT. BEN’S BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING - STILL DARK
A RINGING PHONE wakes Ben from a dead sleep.
On his
nightstand, we see the book -- Twitter for Dummies.
Hello.

BEN

BECKY (O.S.)
Hey Ben, it’s Becky. From Jules'
office.

50.
BEN
(looks at his clock - it’s
5:30)
Hey, what’s up?
BECKY (O.S.)
Jules's driver is MIA. He’s not
answering any of my texts. I know
you drove Jules yesterday and I
didn’t hear any complaints, so can
you pick her up this morning?
Sure.

BEN

BECKY (O.S.)
You know where she lives?
BEN
(is she kidding?)
I was there yesterday.
BECKY (O.S.)
Okay, so you remember?
Yes.

BEN

BECKY (O.S.)
(loudly)
And you’re hearing me, right?
(Ben rolls his eyes)
Ben!!!
BEN
Loud and clear, boss.
BECKY (O.S.)
Okay, so be there at 7:45, ring the
bell and walk away. She’ll know
it’s you.
BEN
Ring bell, walk away. Got it.
BEN’S FINGER ON JULES'S DOOR BELL
He rings, waits a sec.
BEN
-- Oh. Walk away.
Just as Ben turns to walk away the door OPENS.
back, Matt is at the door.

Ben turns

MATT
Hi, you’re here for Jules?
Yes, hi.
car.

BEN
Sorry. I’ll wait in the

MATT
She’s on the phone... want to come
in? Just made some coffee.
(Ben hesitates)
Could be a while.
(offers his hand)
I’m Matt.
BEN
Ben Whittaker.
Daddy!

PAGIE (O.S.)

MATT
Come on in, watch your step.
Ben pauses in the ENTRY as he HEARS Jules's Voice upstairs.
INT. KITCHEN
Paige sits at the island, eating Oatmeal and playing a game
on an iPad.
MATT
Have a seat, Ben. Paige this is
Ben. He works with Mommy.
Ben takes a seat on the stool next to Paige. Matt hands Ben
a mug of coffee then starts packing Paige’s lunch box.
BEN
(to Paige)
Hi...
PAIGE
(showing him her iPad)
I’m playing Princess Memory Game.
BEN
Looks like you’re about to win.
PAIGE
(finishes with a touch)
I did!
He gives her a thumbs up.

52.
PAIGE (cont’d)
You want to play one time?
-- Sure.

BEN

Paige hands the iPad to Ben. He plays as they chat.
MATT
You’re Jules's new driver?
BEN
No, actually, I’m her intern.
Matt pauses from his sandwich making, tries not to react.
PAIGE
That’s hysterical.
MATT
You know what an intern is?
No.

PAIGE

BEN
That’s okay, everyone thinks it’s
hysterical.
Paige points out two matching tiarras on the iPad.
BEN (cont’d)
Oh, good one. Thanks.
With that, Jules ENTERS dressed for work, carrying a cup of
coffee, some clothes for dry cleaning and her heels.
She stops a bit short, surprised to see Ben sitting at the
island, drinking coffee and playing Princess Memory Game.
JULES
...‘Morning.
BEN
(feeling her unease)
Good morning.
MATT
More coffee, Ben?
BEN
No, I’m good, thank you, Matt.
Ben doesn’t know if he should stay or go. Jules drops her
dry cleaning on the counter as she slips on her heels.

53.
MATT
All dry cleaning?
JULES
(feeling exposed in front
of Ben)
Uh, these three are, these are
laundry and this button is loose,
if they could... thanks.
To keep busy, Ben continues playing the game which chimes as
he goes. Jules looks over -- really? Ben mutes it.
MATT
Jules, before you leave, gotta go
over a couple of things.
JULES
Okay.
(surprises Paige by
showing her a headband)
Found it! It was in your hamper!
(Paige is thrilled)
Matty, did a CTF box arrive for me?
MATT
On the table.
(Jules crosses to it,
opens it)
BEN
I think I’ll just...
PAIGE
(whispers)
Ben...
(Ben turns to her)
You want a raisin?
She hands him one. He eats it.
the contents of the CTF box.

Jules meanwhile is examining

MATT
Okay, tonight...
(Jules takes a photo of
the contents of the box)
Are you listening or did I lose
you? -- Ben, is she listening?
Ben doesn’t know what to say.
JULES
Totally listening. I ordered some
stuff to check on how it arrived.
Not great by the way. Go ahead.

54.
MATT
Okay, tonight you’re working so
Paige and I are going to my Mom’s
for dinner. After school is Ruby’s
birthday party...
Ben slips a look at his phone, sees an E-mail from Fiona Subject: Looking Fwd 2 Tonite! Ben is disappointed,
realizing he now has to work this evening.
MATT (cont’d)
And what about Monday? Do you know
yet if we can do dinner with Annie
and Robby?
JULES
I’m so slammed next week...
(sees Matt is exasperated)
I’m sorry. If you want to go, I’ll
be there. When is it?
MATT
See what men have become Ben?
We’re the new ball and chain.
BEN
(laughs to be polite then
rises)
Thank you for the coffee.
(to Paige)
Thanks for letting me play...
(to Jules)
Meet you in the car?
JULES
Actually I have to go...
(lifts Paige)
C’mon sweetie. Ben, we’re going to
drop Paige at school, okay?
Matt hands Ben Paige’s lunch box.
BEN
(taking it)
Let’s do it.
INT. SUV - MOVING - DAY
Paige sits in her car-seat looking at a book.
to her, on her iPad, answering e-mails.
BEN
Matt seems like a terrific guy.
(Jules looks up)
Sorry didn’t mean to interrupt.

Jules is next

55.
JULES
(back to her e-mails)
That’s okay. I agree. He is.
Who?

PAIGE
The Dad?

JULES
(laughs, then to Ben)
That’s what the other kids call him
because he’s the only Dad in a sea
of Moms.
BEN
I’ve read about these househusbands. Interesting, how that
all worked just now.
JULES
They actually prefer to be called
Stay-at-Home Dads.
BEN
Oh, sorry. Did not know that. Well,
it’s very admirable. He’s a real
21st century father.
JULES
Yes, he is, which beats my 20th
Century father, by a long shot.
(stops typing)
Matt had a really good job in
marketing but when CTF took off, he
left to be a full-time Dad. Saved
our butts.
Jules and Ben’s eyes meet in the rear view mirror. Ben nods,
not wanting to go on too much about this.
Jules returns to her iPad.

Writes an EMAIL TO CANDICE.

JULES EMAIL
C - Love if you would transfer Ben
to another team. K?
(looks outside)
Oh. We’re here big girl!
EXT. PRE-SCHOOL - FOLLOWING
Jules walks Paige toward the other Kids and Moms at the gate.
The other Moms notice Jules was “driven” to school, eye each
other about that, then turn away. Ben notices their chilly
behavior as Jules approaches them.

56.
MOM #1
Jules, nice to see you here.
(Jules doesn’t react to
her lack of subtlety)
Not sure if you saw our e-mail, but
we’re doing a Fiesta lunch next
Friday and we thought you could
bring the guacamole but you
probably won’t have time to make
it, so you can buy it -- which will
be fine. Enough for 18.
JULES
I can make it. Not a problem.
Great.

MOM #2
Matt can bring it.

JULES
(keeping a lid on it)
Totally...
Jules looks to Paige who has missed none of this. She kneels
next to her, hands her a little stuffed dog and her lunch.
JULES (cont’d)
Have a great day, honey and have
fun at Ruby’s party, okay?
PAIGE
Mommy do you know how to make
guacamole? You can tell me the
truth.
JULES
Yes, I do. Really well! We’ll make
it together, okay? Followed by a
mother-daughter dance party...
Paige nods with a big smile. A worried-looking little girl
in braids watches them standing behind one of the Moms.
JULES (cont’d)
(to the girl)
Hey Maddie, what’s up?
(Maddie ducks behind her
Mom)
Bipolar.

PAIGE

JULES
OhmyGod..
(hugs Paige.)
I love you big girl.

57.
THE CAR DOOR SLAMS
Jules hits the backseat hard.
JULES
God! Taking the high road is
exhausting! It’s 2013, are we
really still critical of working
Moms?! Seriously? Still?
(to Ben)
I’m sorry. That was all rhetorical.
No need to respond.
BEN
Wasn’t going to.
As Ben pulls into traffic. Jules notices Candice has written
her back.
CANDICE’S EMAIL
Transfer Ben? Really? Why?
JULES TYPES
I don’t know. Too observant.
Jules rubs her temples then turns her attention to the CTF
BOX next to her.
JULES
Oh! Ben, I want to stop at the
warehouse. 480 Greenpoint.
Ben moves into the LEFT LANE.
JULES (cont’d)
No, no, make a right. 9th to
Hamilton to the Expressway.
BEN
I think we should take 4th to
Flatbush. Much faster.
JULES
It won’t be.
BEN
By 12 minutes. At least.
(sees her in the rearview)
Can I try?
EXT. CTF WAREHOUSE - GREENPOINT - DAY
The SUV sits in front of a block long warehouse with the
letters CTF on the outside.

58.
INT. SUV
JULES
I apologize.
No need.

BEN

They both open their car doors at the same time.
INT. WAREHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
Endless rows of shelving units. Workers on golf carts. An
enormous table in the center where mostly Latina Female
Workers fold the clothes, toss them in plastic bags and box
them.
Ben stands near the door, shaking hands with the Foreman,
then catches Jules showing the Workers the photo on her
iPhone. She then demonstrates what she wants by carefully
folding the clothes herself and neatly placing them in bags.
She makes a joke and the women around the table laugh. Ben
can’t help but be impressed. SAMBA MUSIC BEGINS.
EXT. CTF - A LITTLE LATER - ESTABLISHING - MUSIC CONTINUES
INT. CTF’S MASSAGE ROOM - MUSIC CONTINUES
The walls are covered in ethnic fabrics. The room is dimly
lit. Fiona lights a candle when there’s a KNOCK on the door.
It’s open.

FIONA

The DOOR OPENS, Ben stands tentatively in the hallway.
FIONA (cont’d)
Ben! Come on in.
BEN
(entering)
Wow, didn’t expect this.
FIONA
I like to think of it as a little
bit of paradise. Can I interest you
in a back rub?
BEN
Oh, no, no thanks. I came by
because I just found out I have to
work late --

59.
FIONA
Awww... Then, no dinner tonight?
BEN
Sorry. I was really looking forward
to it. Was hoping we could pick
another night.
FIONA
Of course. Come sit down.
Ben checks his watch, then sits in a comfy chair as Fiona
lights another candle then sits on a stool at Ben’s feet.
FIONA (cont’d)
What about a foot massage?
BEN
(giggles, tries to resist)
During office hours?
FIONA
That’s kinda the point.
(points to Ben’s feet)
May I?
Ben nods as Fiona slips off his shoes, then gently rolls his
socks down and off. Ben slides down a bit in his chair.
BEN
It’s already pretty good.
FIONA
All I’ve done is take off your
socks.
BEN
Yeah, well, no one’s ever done that
better.
(then, as she begins)
Whoa!
Fiona has placed oil in her hands and has taken Ben’s right
foot between her palms and massages it deeply. Ben’s dying.
FIONA
Try to relax. You can shut your
eyes if you want.
Ben nods, shuts his eyes as the massaging continues, the
candles flicker and the Samba slows down. Wow...
FIONA (cont’d)
So when would you like to
reschedule?

60.

Tomorrow?

BEN

FIONA
Can’t tomorrow. What about
Saturday?
BEN
Good. Oh, God, this is
enormously....satisfying.
(opens one eye)
What time should I pick you up?
FIONA
How’s noon? I love daytime dates.
Lunch.

BEN
Perfect. It’s sooner.

FIONA
(laughs, then)
So how’s it going?

How’s Jules?

BEN
Her world’s a fascinating one to
fall into. Hope I can help her.
Help her?

FIONA

BEN
She works on all cylinders all the
time. Doesn’t stop, doesn’t
sleep...never see her eat. Maybe
it’s good that I’m here, you
know...
FIONA
(stops massaging for a
sec)
I knew you were gonna be a good
guy. I knew it!
Ben looks at Fiona, smiles.

She massages him deeply. Oh boy.

BEN
This can’t be okay to do at work.
He rests his head back, closes his eyes. The massaging just
gets better and better. Ben almost loses it - big moan.
Just then, Davis opens the door, sees candlelight, hears Ben
moaning and Fiona hunched over him. Ben and Fiona both turn,
looking caught.
DAVIS
Ohmygod! I’m sorry! Oh, jeez. Okay
don’t stop. I’m leaving!

61.
He can’t get out the door fast enough.
INT. OFFICES - END OF THE DAY
Most of the Interns have left for the day. Ben sits at his
desk, reviewing an apartment lease for Davis.
BEN
I don’t know, kid, this lease
doesn’t look so hot to me.
Three months security deposit?
must love the place.

You

DAVIS
No, it’s horrible but I can get in
this week.
BEN
If you can keep looking I would.
(looks up, notices a
jittery Lewis)
What’s up Lewis? I’ve never seen
you so awake.
LEWIS
I was just asked to deliver this
huge order to Tribeca and I think
it’s to Jay Z’s apartment. I’m not
kidding. Look -- it says, S.
Carter, I’m a little freaked out.
BEN
I don’t know who that is but is
this someone you’d like to impress?
LEWIS
This is a genius, Ben and he’s got
the hottest chick in the game -Beyonce could potentially answer
the door.
BEN
Okay, I know who she is. Maybe you
should put on a proper shirt, with
a collar.
LEWIS
Why, do I look bad?
BEN
-- Dress to impress Lewis. Go in
the closet, find a “boyfriend
shirt” that fits. And try to bring
the hair down.

62.
JASON
(joining)
Benjamin, I made some progress.
BEN
Very big day for the intern team.
JASON
It was great, she yelled at me butBEN
-- She yells at me all the time
too.
JASON
Hey, it was communication.
The guys high five. Lewis re-enters, wearing a girl’s
“boyfriend shirt” -- shows himself to Ben.
LEWIS
I’m possibly meeting Jay Z and or
Beyonce and I’m in a blouse.
BEN
Wear it dude. It’s an improvement.
JASON
(shocked at how good he
looks)
Whoa. Big one.
EXT. CTF BUILDING - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING
INT. OFFICES - SAME TIME
The place is nearly empty. Jules is working alone in her
Conference Room, takes a bite of a slice of pizza. She
notices Ben, way across the field of desks, also eating.
ANGLE - BEN
Typing slowly at his computer and eating a Subway. He notices
Jules approaching, carrying a pizza box and two bottles of
beer. He wonders where she’s headed.
JULES
(arrives at his desk)
I hate eating alone.
So do I.

BEN

Jules offers Ben a beer, pulls up a chair.

63.
JULES
I swiped these from the tech
fridge.
BEN
Nice goin’.
(toasts her)
Cheers.
JULES
Want a slice?
BEN
Sure. Thanks.
(treading lightly)
I noticed a couple of hours ago you
had a meeting with another possible
CEO. Saw him arrive. How’d that go?
JULES
Was going well until he called us,
I believe the term he used was a
“chick site.” Then I didn’t hear
anything he said after that.
Nooo.

BEN

JULES
Apparently selling “clothes” makes
us a chick site. I mean, really?
How is this not legit?
BEN
Couldn’t agree more. I find that...
surprising.
JULES
Sexism in business? Really?
(takes a swig of her beer)
What did you do for work Ben,
before you retired?
BEN
I was a VP for Dex One.
JULES
... Phone books?
BEN
I was in charge of printing, before
that ran sales and advertising.
JULES
So big jobs...
(Ben nods)
Wait, wasn’t this a factory that

64.
JULES (cont'd)
made phone books..?
(Ben smiles...)
No! What? This is where you worked?
BEN
For almost forty years.
(Jules can’t believe it)
For twenty-some years I sat right
by that window. That was my
office. It was up a few steps back
then. I could look out over the
whole factory. Our printing
presses were in that corner. That’s
why the floor dips back there.
Nooooo....

JULES

BEN
I know everything about this
building. Or used to. You know the
Sycamores out front?
JULES
Yeah, I love them.
BEN
I remember the day they were
planted.
JULES
(wipes a tear)
Is it totally weird being back
here?
BEN
No, feels like home. Remodeled but
home.
JULES
(takes a sip of beer,
notices Ben’s screen)
So you’re on Facebook, huh?
BEN
Well, I’m trying to figure it out.
I joined ten minutes ago.
JULES
Better late than never. Want some
help?
BEN
I’d love some but, really, you
don’t have to waste your time.

JULES
-- I need a diversion.
photo of yourself?

You have a

BEN
No, do I need one?
JULES
(takes out her phone)
If you want to find all those
hotties from high school. Hold on.
(takes Ben’s photo, looks
at it)
Cute. I’ll send it to you. Okay,
now there’s these questions for
your profile that you can answer if
you want or not.
(scans them)
Religious beliefs, political
beliefs, people who inspire you...
BEN
Jules Ostin.
(Jules shoots him a look)
I’m not trying to brown-nose you,
but I’ve been in business a long
time and have never run across
anyone quite like you. You do
inspire, Jules.
JULES
You know what? I just knew a woman
at the end of the day with a glass
of wine and a laptop had real
shopping potential. And if we
actually promise her things would
fit...
BEN
See -- that’s what I mean.
JULES
(changing subject, reads
his screen)
Okay do you have a favorite quote?
BEN
I do. You’re never wrong to do the
right thing.
JULES
Who said that -- you?
BEN
Yes, but Mark Twain said it first.
Jules laughs as she types the quote into Ben’s profile.

66.
JULES
Favorite music?
BEN
Oh, jeez. Sam Cooke -- one my all
time faves. Love Miles Davis,
Billie Holiday...
JULES
She was great, huh? Hold on...
(goes on iTunes)
What’s your favorite song of hers?
BEN
These Foolish Things.
Jules buys the song and it BEGINS.
JULES
Transports you, doesn’t it?
BEN
Every time.
JULES
Okay. Books?
BEN
Love Clancy. Ludlum. Crazy about
Harry Potter.
JULES
(types those in)
Matt loves Harry Potter too.
JULES (cont’d)
What about your status? Married,
single...?
Widower.

BEN

JULES
Oh, I’m sorry. I think we should
say single then... Okay, now you
know what you need?
(Ben looks to her)
Someone to friend.
BEN
I’ll be friends with the other
interns. They’ll show me how to do
it the morning.
JULES
You can friend me.

67.

Thank you.

BEN

Jules types in her name and confirms.
JULES
Okay, congrats -- you’re now part
of the Facebook generation.
(finishes her beer, rises)
I’ve got about another hour of
work. You good with that?
Of course.

BEN
This was great, Jules.

JULES
Yeah, nice to have an adult
conversation with an adult man. You
know what I mean, not about work
and not about...
BEN
I know what you mean.
Jules nods and awkwardly waves, heading back.
EXT. JULES'S HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT
The SUV pulls quietly in front of the house.
INT. SUV - SAME TIME
Jules is out cold in the backseat and making a racket -snoring. Ben doesn’t know if he should wake her. He sits,
waits, tries not to listen but it’s SO LOUD.
Another car
passes and Jules startles awake.
JULES
Oh. We’re here. Oh...
(straightens up)
Sorry. Was I snoring?
BEN
No, no, just sleeping.
JULES
Oh, then I was snoring. Sorry about
that. You know my parents are
sleep researchers and they’ve
studied my sleep my whole life.
(gathering her things)
Apparently my REM is all screwed up
or the ratio of my flow-volume
curve and my...

It is.
there?

BEN
You need some help back

JULES
No, I’m good.
(Ben Exits, Jules lets
herself out - they meet
on the curb, she loses
her balance, he catches
her)
Thank you. I never fall asleep in
the car so that was actually
amazing. Apologize about the
racket.
BEN
Barely noticed.
JULES
I’ll pretend I believe you.
(looks up at her house)
I love this house. It’s gonna be
great when we’re done. It just
looks happy to me. Like if it was
in a kid’s book, it would make you
feel good when you turned the page
and saw it. Know what I mean?
I do.

BEN

JULES
Well.
(salutes)
Sayonara.
Sayonara.

BEN

Ben watches until Jules is safely inside the house.
INT. JULES BEDROOM - LATER
Jules EXITS her bathroom in her pj’s,and slides into bed next
to Matt who is asleep. She turns toward Matt. He stirs.
MATT
Didn’t hear you come in.

69.
JULES
You know... I was thinking...
(Matt opens his eyes)
We need some awake time together.
Matt nods, kisses her. Just what she needed.
JULES (cont’d)
Yeah...and that too.
Matt kisses her more deeply. Her eyes fill up as she kisses
him back and they begin to make love.
EXT. JULES'S HOUSE - THE NEXT MORNING
Jules EXITS her front door and sees the SUV waiting at the
curb. She squints at Ben, wondering why he didn’t ring the
bell.
INT. BACKSEAT
Jules get in, cheerier than we’ve seen her before.
‘Morning.

JULES

Doris, one of the other new Senior Interns, sits behind the
wheel and turns to Jules.
DORIS
Good morning. I’m Doris. They
asked me to drive you today. All
set back there? Seat belt
fastened?
JULES
Where’s Ben?
DORIS
Somebody said he got transferred.
You know the best way to get to
headquarters?
Without looking, Doris PULLS INTO THE STREET, a car swerves
around her HONKING.
DORIS (cont’d)
Hold your horses, maniac!
(turns back to Jules)
Which way, hon? I’m all turned
around here.
HONNNKKKKK.

70.
CLOSE - CANDICE
Walking through the office on her cell.
CANDICE
You told me to transfer him!
JULES - DRIVING THE SUV
Doris is in the backseat.
JULES
(into her phone)
-- That was 2 days ago! Why didn’t
you check with me?
CANDICE
First of all, it was yesterday...
JULES
Where is he, do you know?
INT. STARBUCKS - BROOKLYN - SAME TIME
Ben is waiting at the “pick up” end of the counter, standing
between two other office-schleppers. This recent turn of
events has left him looking and feeling uncomfortable.
His name is called and he’s handed two take out trays of
coffee. Just as he takes them, he looks across the crowded
shop and spots Jules rushing through the door.
JULES
(sees Ben, crosses to him)
You must think I’m demented.
BEN
Not the word I’d use, but I was a
little surprised when I got the
call. Jules, I apologize if I
overstepped in some way...
JULES
-- No, no, no. No, don’t apologize.
You did nothing wrong. Look, I have
a lot going on, and I’m a really
private person and at first, I
don’t know, I thought maybe this
wasn’t going to work but I was
wrong. Let me take one of those.
(takes one of the trays)
BEN
Jules, no explanation necessary.

71.
JULES
No, actually one is, Ben, ‘cause
I’m usually better than this. The
truth is, something about you makes
me feel calm or more centered or
Zen, and I can use that. Obviously.
I hope you’ll accept my apology and
come back to work. For me. If you
would....
(Ben almost hesitates)
And I’m not just saying this
because I screwed up but I was
thinking this morning, I’d like to
move you up to my area, next to
Becky. I know you can handle more
work, if you’d like more. God, I
really hate that I jumped the gun
and made you feel-BEN
I’m happy to come back.
JULES
Thank you.
(catches her breath)
That’s great. Can I give you a lift
back to the office?
Sure.

BEN

JULES
(as they walk away
together)
You mind driving? I don’t actually
have a license.
INT. OFFICES - LATER THAT DAY
Jason and Kiko are adding a new DESK right next to Becky who
is freaking out. Ben ARRIVES holding his briefcase, keyboard,
a few files and things.
BECKY
-- This is crazy Ben. Two desks
are not going to fit in here.
BEN
I promise to stay out of your way.
BECKY
That’s impossible, I have no room
to-(shuts up when Jules
ARRIVES)

72.
JULES
Hi. This is good, right? I like
this arrangement. Becky, I want
you to let Ben give you a hand,
okay? And cc him on all my e-mails.
(Becky nods)
Did we get yesterday’s numbers?
BECKY
Yes. We did. I saw them here.
Becky looks all over her messy desk. Can’t find them. Ben
spots the sheet with the numbers and indicates to Becky where
it is with his eyes. Becky follows, hands them to Jules.
BECKY (cont’d)
Here you go.
JULES
Thanks. Also, I need to go over the
data on the customer purchase
patterns. Let Ben take a look at
that too. Actually let Ben take a
look at it first.
(This throws Becky)
Don’t worry Beck. Back up’s good.
Ping me when Candice gets in.
Jules heads off. As soon as she’s out of sight, Becky breaks
down in tears. Ben motions for Jason to go to her. Jason
nervously walks to Becky and she collapses into him. He puts
his arms around her, thrilled but not sure what to say.
Becky..?

BEN

BECKY
(turning to Ben)
I’ve been here 9 months, Ben, and
she’s never asked me to take a look
at anything for her. Ever. Okay?
I hear ya.

BEN
That’s frustrating.

BECKY
Totally! I went to Penn, I have a
business degree but I never seem to
do anything right around here and
you’re like 50 years older than me
and deaf and...
(collapses into Jason he’s so happy)
BEN
(sneaks Jason his hanky)
I happen to think you do a lot of
things right.

73.
JASON
(offering Becky the hanky)
You do. So much.
BECKY
(using the hanky)
I know that, but she doesn’t. I
bust my ass for her 14 hours a day.
She never notices. Ohmygod, I hate
girls that cry at work.
(backs away from Jason)
Breaking news... my life sucks!
BEN
How about if you, just as an
experiment, try letting me help
you. A lot of your stress is going
to be lifted once you’re out from
under this mountain of work.
(She starts to say
something)
And maybe you should consider
leaving here at a normal hour once
in a while, see your friends, have
a little fun.
JASON
I can offer my assistance in this
area. Would love to actually.
BECKY
I just don’t want her to think I
can’t do my job and need an
“intern” to help me.
BEN
Okay... you’re not going to want to
hear this, but I heard women who
sleep less than 7 hours a night
gain 38% more weight than women who
sleep more than 7 hours a night.
BECKY
(sobbing now)
What?! I leave here every night at
11, I’m back at 7, I sleep like 5
hours a night. Now I’m going to get
fat?!!
BEN
(indicating her stack of
work)
Let’s get through this stuff. Let’s
do it together. Let’s clean slate
it.
Jason pats her arm just to punctuate.

74.
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER
Jules, Candice and a small group are intently huddled around
a LAP TOP. They’re watching a live CTF MAP of the U.S. that
shows purchases as they happen. Icons of Shopping Bags pop up
in Miami, Tuscon, Chicago, etc.
CANDICE
(watching a sale)
Thank you St. Louis.
JULES
Okay, look at Chicago, she put the
same boots in her cart as the woman
in Houston. Let’s see what she
does at check out. What?! She’s not
buying them either. Check the
delivery costs on those boots, will
you? Why aren’t they selling?
Ben gently knocks on the open door. Jules turns to him.
BEN
I took a look at the data purchase
patterns... Shall I come back?
JULES
No, no, come on in. That was fast.
BEN
Well, I enlisted Becky’s help.
Seems the most expensive place
you’re advertising is actually
bringing you the customers who are
spending the least and the channels
you’re least investing in are
adding enormous value in segments
that currently appear to have low
value but actually have the highest
spending potential...
(everyone stares in awe)
That’s what I could tell. So far.
JULES
Whoa. Ben! Could you like deal
with all that for me? Maybe come
up with a better plan? I mean, if
you have the time.
Happy to.

BEN

Candice loves that Jules is delegating. She smiles at Jules.
JULES
The man spent 40 years in business.

75.

I get it.

CANDICE

BEN
And Jules. Becky was a huge help in
this. You know she has a business
degree from Penn.
JULES
I know. I mean, I forgot, but I
know.
(Ben doesn’t let her off
the the hook)
I’ll say something to her.
BEN
That’ll be major.
(Ben exits)
The Women in the room, just watch after him. Loving him.
A LARGE DUFFEL LANDS NEAR BEN’S DESK - LATER
DAVIS O.S.
How’s it goin’ up here in first
class?
BEN
(sending off an e-mail)
Busy. I see you found an apartment.
DAVIS
Nope. My two weeks were up. I’m
moving in with my cousin.
Excellent.

BEN

DAVIS
In Philadelphia.
Davis!

BEN

DAVIS
What? It’s only for a few weeks.
I’ll get there by eleven, leave at
five. That’s cool. I can do it.
BEN
I feel like everybody’s uncle
around here...
Why?

DAVIS

76.
BEN
Because I’m going to save your ass,
and put you up for a few
weeks...obviously.
Davis grabs Ben, hugs him, kisses him on the cheek. Then
kisses him again.
BEN (cont’d)
Okay, okay... Easy fella...
INT. BEN’S DEN - THAT NIGHT
Ben is in a recliner, wearing pjs and a robe and Davis is on
the couch in sweats. They’re watching Sports Center.
DAVIS
You got the life here, dude. You’re
a great cook. You got a dream
house. Big TV’s in every room. A
backyard. You got it made.
(Ben doesn’t answer)
Ben?
Still no answer. Davis sits up, stares at Ben. He can only
see him from the side.
DAVIS (cont’d)
You okay?
(stands)
Ben! Yo!
(no response from Ben)
Hey, look! Fiona’s here! She’s
totally naked! She’s....
Still nothing. Davis looks at Ben’s hand, which has fallen
limply at his side.
Ohmygod.

DAVIS (cont’d)

Davis nervously steps away from the couch, moves closer to
Ben -- runs his hand in front of Ben’s nose and mouth.
Doesn’t feel a thing.
DAVIS (cont’d)
(screams)
BEN!!!!!
Ben jerks awake.

Davis leaps back, grabbing his heart.

Oh, fu--!

DAVIS (cont’d)
Thank God! You’re alive!

BEN
-- What is wrong with you?

77.
DAVIS
You scared me. We were talking,
drinking beers and then suddenly
radio silence. And your hand looked
so out of it.
BEN
Jesus Christ, Davis. I dozed off.
If I die, you’ll know.
DAVIS
Very funny. And obviously I won’t,
but... Oh, man, am I relieved. I am
not the right person to find a dead
body.
BEN
I’m starting to understand why your
parents kicked you out. I’m going
to hit the hay. Do not check on me.
DAVIS
I won’t, I promise, but can I sit
in the recliner or is that like off
limits for anyone but..
BEN
-- Be my guest.
(rises, notices something
on the table)
Why would you put your beer next to
the coaster?
DAVIS
(moving it onto the
coaster)
You’re right. I’m sorry. So where
are the master quarters? Just so I
know in case of any...
(off Ben’s look)
It wasn’t on the tour. I’m curious.
INT. BEN’S BEDROOM
The Boys admire the well made bed.
DAVIS
I like that you do the throw pillow
thing.
BEN
I was married for a very long time.
DAVIS
Whoa! Is that your closet?

78.
The Boys ENTER BEN’S CLOSET.
and bigger than you’d think.

Organized, color coordinated,

DAVIS (cont’d)
Busy man about town! What is in
all these drawers?
BEN
Boxers, t-shirts, pocket squares,
handkerchiefs...
DAVIS
Okay, what’s the deal with the
handkerchief? That one I just don’t
get, at all.
BEN
It’s essential. That your
generation doesn’t know that is
criminal. The best reason to carry
a handkerchief is to lend it. Ask
Jason about this. Women cry, Davis.
We carry it for them. One of the
last vestiges of the chivalrous
gent.
(Davis is enamoured)
I know you want to hang, but I have
to go to sleep, kid. I’m pooped.
(pats Davis shoulder)
‘Sleep tight.
DAVIS
Night Ben. Thank you!
(hugs him hard)
Will you wake me in the morning or
is that asking too much? My
parents always-Too much.

BEN

The Boys EXIT IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS as Ben turns out the
lights. We stay in the dark..
DAVIS (O.S.)
Understood. I’ll set the alarm on
my phone... I just hope I hear it.
I’m a deep...
--OhmyGod.

BEN (O.S.)
I’ll wake you!

DAVIS (O.S.)
Thank you. Love you! Not kidding.

79.
INT. JULES & MATT’S KITCHEN - THE NEXT A.M.
Matt is packing Paige’s lunch. Paige and Ben sit side-byside at the island, eating pancakes. A few work folders sit
by Ben’s plate.
PAIGE
(to Ben)
Can you pour me more syrup please?
(Ben pours)
Perfect. Good job.
Ben and Matt laugh as Jules ENTERS.
JULES (O.S.)
Oh, boy!
(fixing herself coffee)
Okay, so this really big CEO named
Townsend, the one everyone said
would never be interested in us,
because we weren’t big enough for
him...
MATT/BEN
(at the same time)
-- Yeah?
MATT
We’re like your sister-wives.
JULES
(laughs, then)
Well, we just found out -- he’s
beyond interested.
Exciting.

MATT

Ben looks from Matt to Jules.

Jules and Ben connect for a

JULES
Yeah, maybe. Everyone’s flipping
out, but you know I’m still on the
fence at best, but anyway, only
thing is, I have to go to San
Francisco to meet him. He can’t
get here.
MATT
(handing her pancakes)
When do you have to go?
JULES
The only day he could meet is next
Thursday. Want to come? Maybe we
could stay for the weekend?

80.
MATT
(looks at fridge calendar)
Sounds good but... I can’t. Paige
is snack leader on Thursday and I’m
supposed to be in the class with
her. It’s kind of a big deal.
JULES
Right. No, I forgot.
MATT
Maybe Ben could go with you.
PAIGE
Yeah. Dat’s a good idea.
JULES
Guys, Ben has a life.
BEN
-- Not really.
(Jules looks over at him)
Not one that takes me to San
Francisco. If you want the company,
I’d love to go.
Really?

JULES

BEN
Definitely.
PAIGE
Guess what Ben? Today my Dad is
going to be Ariel, it’s his turn.
BEN
That’s good, right?
MATT
You think finding a CEO is a big
deal? Here the big negotiation is
about who gets to be Ariel when we
play Little Mermaid and, just for
the record, it’s never been my
turn.
This is huge. I get to comb
my hair with a fork... play with
gadgets and gizmos a-plenty...
Paige giggles as Jules looks lovingly at Matt, almost tearyeyed. Ben picks up on this, smiles to himself when Jules’s
phone RINGS and breaks the moment.
INT. SUV - MOVING QUCKLY - SHORTLY AFTER
Ben, behind the wheel. Jules on SPEAKER PHONE with Candice.

81.
JULES
-- So guys how long ‘til we get it
fixed? I mean, if you can’t zoom
in, you probably won’t buy.
Ben nods, agreeing.

They exchange looks in the rear view.

CANDICE O.S.
First couple of hours are already
down 23%.
Oh, boy.

BEN

JULES
I’ll be there in like...
BEN
-- Six minutes.
CANDICE
We’re on it.

O.S.

JULES
Ben, do you have the info on the
friends shopping together...
Ben hands Jules a folder as her 2nd CELL RINGS. She quickly
answers as she peruses the folder.
JULES (cont’d)
This is Jules.
JULES'S MOM
(on Speaker)
What’s wrong?
JULES
Oh, Mom. Hi. Oh, I just found out
the zoom link...the button you
click on to zoom in on a photo
isn’t working.
JULES'S MOM
That doesn’t sound like a big deal.
JULES
Actually it is... it’s how people
get a closer look at what they’re
buying. Everyone zooms in.
JULES'S MOM
-- Oh, I guess I don’t go to your
website enough to know that.
Jules makes an incredulous face at the phone, then starts
typing an e-mail to Matt as her other phone RINGS

82.
CLOSE - E-MAIL TO MATT
JULES'S EMAIL
Matt -- Question. Why is my mother
always such a raging bitch?
JULES'S MOM
Typing and ringing....
JULES
(looking at 2nd phone)
Yeah, sorry.
It’s the warehouse.
Can I call you back Mom?
No need.

JULES'S MOM

JULES
Okay. Love you.
Yep.
CLICK.

JULES'S MOM

Ben’s eyes widen.
JULES
(to herself)
Who says yep to I love you?

Ben can’t disagree on that one. Jules continues her e-mail.
JULES'S E-MAIL
She’s seriously f-ed up. How did I
turn out so normal?
(she adds an - “ish” to
normal, answers phone)
JULES
Hey Alonzo.
LATINO VOICE
Jules, I have not good news.
JULES
Lay it on me.
LATINO VOICE
In a routine check by the
sanitation department, they found
one bed bug in the warehouse.
Noooo!

JULES

ALONZO
Unfortunately, yes. We sent out
4800 boxes yesterday. We have to

83.
ALONZO (cont'd)
get them all back, shut down the
warehouse, spray for bedbugs, then
we can start shipping again.
Nightmare!

JULES/BEN

As Ben pulls up in front of CTF, Jules grabs her bag then
realizes she didn’t send Matt her e-mail about her Mom. She
types in M for the start of Matt’s name, looks out the window
at CTF and INSTEAD OF CLICKING on MATT’S E-MAIL ADDRESS,
accidentally, clicks on MOM’S E-MAIL ADDRESS. Distracted,
she PUSHES SEND.
INT. OFFICES - MOMENTS LATER
Jules, walking hyper-fast through the office. Ben is a few
paces behind her. Suddenly, she STOPS, senses she might have
done something awful.
JULES
No no no no no!
Jules looks at her phone, checks her last SENT E-mail and
SEES SHE ACCIDENTALLY SENT the “My mother’s such a bitch” email to her Mother. She GASPS, looks up as Ben joins her.
INT. BIG CONFERENCE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
At least 20 Techies are scrambling into the room for an
emergency meeting. Jules paces at the head of the room,
washing her hands with Purell. Ben stands to the side as
Candice and Becky join.
JULES
I know the Zoom’s broken and I
don’t mean to take anyone off of
that but... I need a favor. I,
accidentally sent an e-mail to the
wrong person and she’s at work
right now and I know she doesn’t
check her personal e-mail until she
gets home at 5:30, so I have until
then to figure out how to delete it
because if this person sees this email, it’ll be...horrible and on
top of that, she has a slight heart
condition and I think this could
possibly be not good for that, so,
I’m relying on your good graces and
brilliance to figure out how to
save my ass.
(a few laughs)
Please tell me there’s a way.

TECHIE #1
Are you two on the same server?
JULES
I’m on gmail she’s on Earthlink.
Mumbles from the crowd.

Earthlink??

JULES (cont’d)
Okay, whatever.
The Guys talk amongst themselves. Argue it out.
TECHIE #2
Truthfully Jules, it’s pretty
impossible to hack into a server.
(Jules sinks)
TECHIE #3
And you definitely don’t know her
password?
No idea.

JULES

Ben crosses to the front of the room, joins Jules, turning
her away from the crowd.
BEN
I think there’s only one thing you
can do.
JULES
What? Tell me. I’m dying.
BEN
I think me and the boys take off,
break into your Mom’s house and
steal her computer.
JULES
Break in and steal her computer?!!
Are you kidding me?!
(He’s not)
That’s fucking genius.
EXT. STREET - NEW HAVEN, CONN. - DAY
Jules's SUV makes its way into a suburban neighborhood.
GPS VOICE (O.S.)
Turn right in 300 yards.

INT. JULES'S SUV - MOVING - SAME TIME
Ben’s driving. Jason is next to him. In the backseat, Davis

JASON
Little does GPS Lady know she’s an
accomplice to a crime.
BEN
The woman has a heart condition,
think of it as a good deed.
DAVIS
I never thought you’d be a bad
influence on me, Whittaker.
BEN
Relax fellas, this is going to be
painless. The key is under a
flower pot, we go in, we delete, we
disappear.
LEWIS
She doesn’t have an alarm, right?
BEN
No she does not.
JASON
And what if we need a password to
get onto her e-mail. Then what?
BEN
Then we take the computer. Jules
said she’d buy her a new one so
it’s a win/win.
GPS VOICE
You have reached your destination
in 100 yards.
LEWIS
This is like an Oceans movie.
Ben’s the older guy in the big
glasses..
JASON
Elliot Gould. Come on...
LEWIS
Jason -- you’re Clooney.
Thank you.

JASON

LEWIS
I’m Matt Damon ‘cause I’m kind of
an outsider.
Who am I?

DAVIS

LEWIS
You’re Ben Affleck’s brother.
DAVIS
Why aren’t I Brad Pitt?
LEWIS
I think that’s self explanatory.
BEN
Okay, Clooney, you’re behind the
wheel. Keep the engine running and
your eyes open. Damon, Affleck’s
brother, you’re with me.
Three car doors open at the same time.

Davis

The KEY IS INSERTED into the LOCK. As soon as the Boys ENTER
THE KITCHEN, they hear a BEEPING SOUND. They look around,
SPOT AN ALARM KEYPAD on the wall.
DAVIS
Great plan so far. Fuck!
BEN
Davis, call Becky.
Davis quickly dials, hands his phone to Ben.
LEWIS
If we don’t know the code, this is
going to turn into an alarm in 60
seconds.
BEN
(into phone)
Becky, put Jules on, it’s-(can’t believe it)
-- She put me on hold. What is
wrong with that girl?
DAVIS
(starts to panic)
This is so not good. What are we
supposed to do?

87.
BEN
Start looking for the computer.
(they go off together)
Separately!
(into Phone)
-- Becky! Don’t screw around. Put
Jules on, it’s an emergency.
Interrupt her!
(wipes his brow)
Jules! Your mother has an alarm.
Yes she does, I’m in her kitchen
and it’s about to go off. What’s
the code?
ANGLE JULES
rushing outside of the Conference Room, on her cell
JULES
I have no idea. Ben, listen to me.
BACK AT THE HOUSE
Davis ENTERS THE KITCHEN, without the computer.
INTERCUT JULES AND BEN - JULES ON SPEAKERPHONE
JULES
-- I know this woman, trust me,
that’s a fake alarm she bought from
some infomercial or something.
It’s not connected. It’s just to
scare off burglars.
DAVIS
(freaking out)
It’s doing a good job.
JULES
My parents would never pay for a
burglar alarm,. They’re the
cheapest people in America.
BEN
(maybe believing her)
It hasn’t turned into an alarm
yet...still beeping.
JULES
-- That’s cause it’s a fake. Trust
me on this. Have you found the
computer?
Lewis re-enters, empty handed.

Shrugs.

88.
CAMERA FOLLOWS as they all RUSH UP THE STAIRS, in and out of
Bedrooms. Then:
Found it!
Got it!

LEWIS (O.S.)
DAVIS (O.S.)

Both guys ARRIVE in the UPSTAIRS HALLWAY, holding laptops.
BEN
(into phone)
We found two. Which one is hers?
The white one or the silver one?
JULES
(trying to remember)
White one or silver one? White one
or silver one? I don’t know.
BECKY
(joining)
Your Mom’s computer? It’s white.
(Jules hesitates)
I got it fixed for her once. I’m
positive.
JULES
The white one!
Lewis hands the white computer to Ben.
GOES OFF FULL BLAST.
Oh my God!

Just then the ALARM

JULES (cont’d)

DAVIS
I knew there was no such thing as a
fake alarm! We’re getting
arrested. That’s it. We’re dead.
Our fingerprints are all over this
place.
JULES
Ben, do you see the e-mail?
Ben is now in a chair, the computer on a table next to him.
BEN
(opening the computer)
Not yet.
DAVIS
Double time it dude!
Lewis takes over at the computer.

89.
LEWIS
Found it!
(reads)
Why is my mother always such a
raging bitch? Subject: She’s A
Terrorist.
Ben reacts to the e-mail.
Yes!

JULES
Delete it!

It’s gone.

LEWIS

JULES
Now from the trash.
As Lewis deletes from the trash, we hear a POLICE SIREN.
the Guys look up.
BEN
Davis, where’d you find this?
DAVIS
Under the bed. Right side.
Lewis takes off with the computer, comes right back.
LEWIS
Which right side?
DAVIS
Right side facing the bed.
(Lewis exits)
Oh, God, we’re so screwed. My life
is over. I’m going to be a felon
and I haven’t even committed a
crime. You’re old, Whittaker,
they’ll let out for good behavior,
but the rest of us-BEN
Davis! Pull it together. Can’t you
hear how far away that is. We’ve
got at least 30 seconds until
they’re here.
DAVIS
It takes you 30 seconds to stand
up! No offense, but fast is not
one of your speeds. How will I
explain this to my parents? They
will not get breaking and-BEN
Twenty seconds.

Davis FLIES OUT OF FRAME as Lewis returns.
down the stairs as fast as they can.

All three run

JASON - IN THE SUV
Is listening to Lil Wayne very LOUDLY. He’s looking out his
window away from the house oblivious to the siren.
BEHIND HIM WE SEE
Lewis, Davis and Ben, SPRINTING to the car.
When they reach the car, the doors are LOCKED. They bang on
the car doors. Jason doesn’t react. Davis THROWS HIMSELF on
the hood of the car.
DAVIS
Open the fucking doors!!!!!!
Jason LEAPS, flips the unlock door switch. The Guys jump in.
Davis has to slide off the hood and run to catch up.
CLOSE - 5 TEQUILA SHOTS
Five hands ENTER FRAME and lift them up.
INT. BAR - BROOKLYN - NIGHT
Jules and the Four Guys take the Tequila shots. It’s not easy
for any of them.
DAVIS
(to Ben)
You’re a crazy son-of-a-bitch, you
know that?
BEN
I didn’t actually. I’m sure my
blood pressure was through the
roof, but...
(sucks on his lime)
--it was worth it.
JULES
Guys, I can’t, literally can’t,
thank you enough for what you just
did. It was so above and beyond
and brave and loyal! I’m indebted
to you forever.
(to Bartender)
I’ll have another.
(to Guys)
Anybody else?

91.
Jason and Lewis nod.
DAVIS
Sure.
(to Bartender)
But can I just get a half this
time?
The Bartender shoots him a look and pours him a a half a
shot. Ben watches Jules throw hers back and then quickly bite
her lime wedge.
Jules!

BEN

JULES
I know. I can drink. It’s a thing
about me. So what are your names
again? I never want to not know
you.
JASON
I’m Jason. I’ve worked for you
about a year. I’ve delivered things
to your home. I’ve met Matt a
bunch of times. I tied your
daughter’s shoe once.
JULES
Of course I’ve seen you around, I
just didn’t know your name.
(to Davis)
And you’re new, right?
DAVIS
Yeah. I’m Davis, I started the same
day as Ben. We’re pretty much
besties and I’m also his mentee. He
gave me this tie for example. It
was his. It’s vintage.
Ben shakes his head, although amused.
JULES
I like it. Love men in ties. And
you’re Lewis. I could hear a little
over the phone. You were very cool
under pressure.
LEWIS
It was my first heist but I tried
to be chill. Thanks for noticing.
JULES
Boys, what can I say? Sorry, didn’t
mean to call you boys. No one calls
men “men” anymore. Have you

92.
JULES (cont'd)
noticed? Women went from Girls to
Women and men went from Men to
Boys. This is a problem. In the
big picture. Know what I mean?
(They don’t. She indicates
one more drink to
Bartender)
Another?

BEN
You sure about that?

JULES
Yup. Here’s my theory about this we all grew up during the “Take
your Daughter to Work Day” thing,
right?
(they nod, although
they’re not sure)
So we were always told we could do
anything, be anything. And I think
somehow the boys got, maybe not
left behind but not quite as
nurtured. We had Oprah, you know. I
wonder sometimes how guys fit
in...they seem to still be trying
to figure it all out. Still
dressing like little boys, still
playing video games.
(takes her next shot)
As she sucks on her lime, Ben wishes she’d slow down.
Oh, boy...

BEN

JULES
Here’s another thing. You ever
notice how the husband on every
commercial on TV is always such a
dope? Has it always been that way
or is the “husband” the new dumb
blonde? In one generation men went
from guys like Al Pacino and
Harrison Ford to...
She pauses as she indicates the Guys who wish they weren’t
standing there in T-shirt and hoodies.
JULES (cont’d)
Look at Ben here. A dying breed...
Look and learn ‘cause if you ask
me...
(points to Ben)
This is what cool is.
BEN
Thanks Ace. You’re not going to
drink anymore, right?

93.
JULES
I mean... calling me Ace... Supercool, right? Okay, I’m officially
a little dizzy, haven’t eaten. I
apologize for the tirade. I’m
gonna have to go but I’m forever in
your debt, gentlemen... another
word that’s never used anymore.
Let’s bring it back, shall we?
Ben, I’ll be Uber-ing home.
She starts to tip over.

Ben catches her.

JULES (cont’d)
And that is what a gentleman does
for a lady.
EXT. BAR - NIGHT
Jules is just finishing throwing up in a trash can as Ben
holds back her hair.
JULES
Achhh. I’m so sorry. I’m fine
now...
(throws up again)
Oh, God...
Ben hands Jules his handkerchief.

She wipes her mouth.

JULES (cont’d)
Haven’t done that since college.
Thank you... Oh, man...
(looks at Ben)
You know what you are...?
Uh, no.

BEN

JULES
You are an actual wonderful person.
And I don’t know many of those.
(Ben appreciates this but
seems more concerned with
how she is)
Very sorry you had to see this.
Humiliating.
BEN
It’s all good.
better?

You feelin’ any

JULES
Yeah. I’m good now. I’m fine.

94.
She cleans her hands with Purell then extends her hand to
Ben. He shakes it. Jules can’t help herself, she folds into
him, leans on him, resting her head on his chest. She
doesn’t move.
JULES (cont’d)
Leaving in a minute. Just working
on making this the worst night
possible for you...
(finally pulls away)
BEN
Not at all.
(she looks up to him...)
You’ve had a stressful day.
A Town Car pulls up.
How is it
the right
thing, be
uncanny.
(with
Thank you

JULES
you always manage to say

the right thing? It’s
a gentle salute)
and......

BEN
(salutes her)
Sayanora.
JULES
Absolutely.
Ben nods as Jules ducks into the cab and it takes off.
EXT. BROOKLYN STREET - SATURDAY AFTERNOON
Amongst the Saturday shoppers, we find Ben and Fiona. Ben’s
in a suit, Fiona, in a dress and heels. Ben’s walk is
noticeably more jaunty.
BEN
Really so nice of you to do this.
Most women would have just
rescheduled.
FIONA
Not to worry. I understand.
They stop at their destination.
BEN
It was unexpected.
Fiona nods as they turn and ENTER a FUNERAL HOME.

95.
INT. FUNERAL HOME - SAME TIME
Ben and Fiona make their way down the center aisle. There’s a
lot of elbowing going on so all can take a gander.
Ben and Fiona take seats next to Ben’s friend Miles.
checks out Fiona.

Miles

MILES
(tickled)
Benjie, you brought a date to a
funeral! Unreal.
BEN
We had plans. Who knew this was
going to -Miles leans over Ben and shakes Fiona’s hand.
MILES
How do you do? I’m Miles.
FIONA
Hello. Fiona. So sorry for your
loss.
MILES
(seeing only her cleavage)
Thank you dear.
(to Ben)
Wowza.
Fiona obviously heard this. Ben looks at her, embarrassed and
then is startled when he catches Patty Pomerantz directly
across the aisle staring him down.
Just then the REAR DOORS TO THE CHAPEL OPEN and the casket is
wheeled into the room, down the center aisle, and past the
mourners. Everyone stands. Ben lets out a sigh. Fiona takes
his hand. Ben looks back at Patty who hasn’t taken her eyes
off of him. He offers her a small “don’t hate me” smile. She
raises her middle finger and starts to say the Fu-- of Fuck
You as the casket moves past and blocks her words. Once the
casket passes, her finger comes down but we get the message.
EXT. STREET - BROOKLYN -DAY
Ben and Fiona turn a corner from a residential street onto a
street lined with shops. Fiona holds a pink bakery box.
Fiona
I never went to a shiva before. The
laughter was wonderful and I don’t
think I’ve ever eaten more... I’m
not even sure how I left with a box
of cookies.

96.
BEN
You were a big hit. Giving the
widow that back massage -- winning
move.
FIONA
She needed it.
BEN
I definitely think it’s a good idea
to take all first dates to a
funeral. Real ice breaker, don’t
you think?
FIONA
I know you’re kidding but honestly,
who needs the strain of the dinner
date and the “Why aren’t you
married” conversation. At our age
it’s not even possible to catch up.
Ben stops, letting others pass around them. Ben and Fiona
stand face to face.
BEN
I can do me in ten seconds. Ready?
Widower. One son. Two grand-kids.
Spent my life manufacturing phone
books which now no longer have a
function. I’m currently working as
an intern, havin’ a ball and best
news is, I have a crush on a girl I
met at work.
FIONA
(loves that, then)
I’m sorry you lost your wife...
Okay...
(points to herself)
Divorced. Three beautiful
daughters. One grandchild, a boy,
on the way. I was sick a few years
back. I’m not anymore. I’m an inhouse e-commerce masseuse. Love my
job and I finally met a man I
actually want to hang out with.
CAMERA RISES as Ben and Fiona continue talking and sharing a
laugh, walking off together. DISSOLVE TO DUSK where Ben and
Fiona cross a tree-lined residential street. Ben takes
Fiona’s hand, she smiles at him as they walk away from us and
down the street, chatting, completely at ease with one
another.

97.
EXT. JULES'S HOUSE - MORNING
The door OPENS to reveal Matt, in a robe, messy hair. He
looks awful. He routinely hands Ben a mug of coffee.
BEN
(taking the coffee)
Hey buddy, you don’t look so great.
MATT
Believe me, I look better than I
feel. Do I feel hot to you?
BEN
(ENTERS, feels Matt’s
forehead)
Not too bad.
MATT
Good. I don’t want the girls to get
this. You see the Knicks last
night?
BEN
They were on fire.
O.S., we HEAR Paige CRYING. They ENTER THE KITCHEN. Paige
sits on her regular counter stool, sobbing. Jules is trying
to get her to eat her oatmeal. Ben takes his seat next to
Paige.
BEN (cont’d)
What’s with the waterworks, Little
One?
JULES
I just told her the sitter’s going
to have to take her to Maddie’s
birthday party today ‘cause Matt’s
sick...
PAIGE
(tearfully)
-- But I don’t want to go with the
sitter. Ben, can you take me?
(between sobs)
Please...?
JULES
Awww, honey, I’m sorry, but Ben has
to go to work today.
Paige dramatically throws her head down on the counter,
sobbing. Her little shoulders shake. Ben can’t take it.

98.
BEN
Jules, come on, it’ll take an hour.
(whispers)
Lemme take her...
Matt indicates -- let him do it. Jules feels badly asking,
but...
INT. SUV - MOVING - DAY
BEN
(driving, mid-argument)
-- I can’t believe we’re still
going through this. I’m going the
right way. Please, have a little
trust.
ANGLE - THE BACK SEAT
Paige is in her car seat, looks up from her toy computer.
PAIGE
But the park where the party is-(looks outside)
Oh, actually this is it.
(returns to computer)
BEN
(shakes his head)
Like a clone.
EXT. PROSPECT PARK PLAY AREA - MOMENTS LATER
A dozen Moms and their 4 Year Olds. Ben arrives holding
Paige’s hand and carrying a gift. The Moms who gave Jules a
hard time at school are all here and silently comment to one
another about Paige’s escort.
BEN
(whispers to Paige)
Which one is Maddie?
PAIGE
(whispers)
The one in the pink.
Ben looks over at a group of kids and sees Ten Little Girls
huddled together all wearing pink.
PAIGE (cont’d)
You can sit with the other Moms,
okay?

99.
BEN
Okay. Want to give Maddie her
present?
Paige rushes off as Ben joins the Moms on the benches.
BEN (cont’d)
Hi. I’m Ben, I’m helping Matt and
Jules out today.
MOM #2
Oh, are you Matt’s Dad?
BEN
No, no, I work for Jules.
One of the Mom’s mumbles to another -- that can’t be fun.
BEN (cont’d)
(catching her drift)
Hmmm?
MOM #1
Oh, nothing, I’ve heard she’s, you
know, kind of “tough.”
(the Other Moms agree)
BEN
Tough? Jules? She’s a total bad
ass. Guess that’s how she became an
internet sensation.
(sees Women are
uncomfortable)
Must make you proud, huh? One of
your own out there every day
crashing the glass ceiling of the
tech world. So -- bravo! Good for
her. Right?
MOM #1
(eating shit)
Yeah...no...for sure.
Ben raises his fist in solidarity. Paige runs to Ben, cuddles
up next to him.
BEN
What’s up kiddo?
PAIGE
I don’t feel good.
BEN
Want to sit on my lap?
Paige nods.

Ben lifts her onto his lap, feels her forehead.

MOM #2
If she’s sick, she probably
shouldn’t be here.
MOM #2’s Daughter heads for Paige. Her Mom grabs her arm,
yanks her back.

Should we hit

PAIGE
Does that mean leave?
INT. SUV - MOVING - PARK SLOPE - SHORTLY AFTER
Paige now seems fine and energetic as they drive down Jules's
street.
PAIGE
I spy with my little
eye...something... blue!
BEN
Is it the car next to us?
No.

PAIGE

BEN
Is it that dog leash?
No!

PAIGE

BEN
Is it the sky?
Yes!

PAIGE
You got one! Your turn Ben.

As Ben nears the house, he SEES Matt, looking entirely better
and bounding down the front steps in a GREEN T-SHIRT.
BEN
Okay, I have a good one. I spy
with my little eye - something
green...
PAIGE
(looking the opposite way,
yawns)
Is it that tree?
Nope.

BEN

101.
PAIGE
Is it that front door? Well, that’s
kinda green.
Ben watches as Matt SMILES AND WAVES TO SOMEONE IN A WAITING
SUV. Curious, Ben gets a little closer and sees it’s a WOMAN
WITH DARK HAIR. Matt gets in the Woman’s car and they
immediately kiss and then kiss again and again.
ANGLE - BEN
Dumbstruck. He’s now dangerously close to the Woman’s car.
He slows down as Matt and the Woman separate, go back for one
more kiss, then drive off.
PAIGE
-- Is it Ben? Is it that front
door?
BEN
Yeah, it is. Good girl.
Ben can’t process what he just witnessed. He’s momentarily
frozen. A car honks at him. Snapping to, he turns at the
corner, looks in the rear view and sees Paige nodding off.
Ben pulls over, parks under a tree, tries to compute what he
just saw. Just then, a TEXT FROM JULES. He looks at his
phone:
TEXT
How’s it going?

Thank you! :)

Ben’s finger trembles but he manages to type back: A-OK.
Then, adds an exclamation point before shutting his eyes for
a quick sec.
His heart races, he can’t seem to focus. And then he hears
something familiar. He looks up at the rear view and sees
Paige is snoring. He looks at her sweet little face and
feels a new found pain just at the sight of her.
EXT. JULES'S HOUSE - AN HOUR LATER
Ben walks up the steps carrying a sleeping Paige.

Awww. Thanks so much Ben.
INT. PAIGE’S ROOM
Ben lies Paige on her bed then Matt pulls up her covers.
Matt turns toward Ben and finds Ben staring at him. Matt
wonders why.

INT. CENTER HALL
Ben crosses to the front door.
MATT
Can I get you something before you
go? Cup of coffee, bite of
something to-BEN
I’m good. Thanks.
MATT
How was she? Didn’t give you any
trouble?
BEN
She was perfect. She wasn’t
feeling so great at the party so
we... we left a little early then
she fell asleep so I just hung out
in the car and let her get in a
nap. She slept good...
MATT
So nice of you. Thank you.
Matt gets a text, takes out his phone, quickly looks at it,
returns the phone to his pocket. Looks up guiltily.
BEN
You seem like you’re feeling more
with it...
MATT
(hates lying)
Yeah. Just needed a little
downtime, I guess or maybe I wasn’t
that sick, I don’t know.
(Ben nods...)
Ben, I wanted to ask you, what’s
your take on this whole CEO thing?
You’re more on the inside than I
am.
BEN
I know Jules is trying to do right
by everybody - the investors, the
company... you... She’s got a lot
on her shoulders. The pressure’s
unreal.
MATT
Am I wrong to hope it happens? I
mean, I want what she wants but you
know what it’s like around here -(MORE)

103.
MATT (cont'd)
we don’t see her enough. Maybe this
will fix that.
BEN
A CEO’s going to fix... what’s
going on here, Matt?
(Matt stops cold)
Whatever she decides...
(wipes his eye...)
I just, I want it to be good for
her, I want her to be happy.
(eyes landing on Matt)
Of course.

MATT

Ben nods, his eyes steady on Matt.
INT. CTF - AFTERNOON
Ben wends his way through the office, pre-occupied, looking a
bit wan. He passes Lewis who is clean shaven, got a bit of a
hair cut and is wearing a tie and carrying a briefcase
exactly like Ben’s. Ben doesn’t notice.
LEWIS
Benjamin, dude, what do you think?
(Ben’s not sure what he
means)
Of my man look. I got so many
compliments, it’s crazy. And check
this out...
(holds up briefcase)
--found it on e-bay. You’re right,
total classic.
BEN
(half-hearted)
You look awesome, kid.
Across the office, Ben notices a small crowd has gathered to
sing “Happy Birthday.” He sees Jules is part of the crowd,
smiling, singing. He takes a deep breath at the sight of
her. Jules gives the Birthday Girl a hug, then spots Ben.
BEN CLICKS ON HIS E-MAIL
He has tons. His desk is now stacked with paperwork.
JULES (O.S.)
How’d it go?
Jules leans on Ben’s desk, eating a piece of cake and handing
Ben a piece.

BEN
You have a great kid, Jules.

She

JULES
Awww. Thank you so much for doing
that. So -- you excited about
going to San Francisco tomorrow?
(Ben wipes his brow with
his hankie, he’s having
trouble having eye
contact with Jules)
You okay?
Yeah.

BEN

JULES
Oh, man, I hope you don’t have what
Matt has.
I don’t.
You sure?

BEN
JULES

BEN
Positive.
(takes a small pill)
JULES
What’s that?
BEN
Blood pressure. Take it everyday.
JULES
You sure you’re okay ‘cause you
don’t look like you. You’re all
flushed. Why don’t you go see
Fiona, the masseuse, and just chill
for a little.
DAVIS
(walks by, notices Ben
mopping his brow)
What’s up? You okay Ben? You seem
to be slightly malfunctioning.
Ben rolls his eyes as Becky joins.
JULES (CONT’D)
Does he look right to you?

105.
BEN
Okay, thank you. I think we’re good
here. Got a lot of work to do.
BECKY
Is it his coloring?
BEN
Oh my God, you’re all nuts. I’m a
hundred percent. Let’s move on
kids. Big day, lots to do.
JULES
Ben, if I’m giving you too much to
do or wearing you out, please do
not think you have to go with me toBEN
-- Jules, people my age get tired
sometimes. That’s all this is.
JULES
You’re tired? That’s why you
haven’t looked at me once since I
walked over here.
BEN
(turns to her)
I’m looking at you.
She realizes he’s looking at her for the first time.
BECKY
Jules, Candice is on the phone.
JULES
If you don’t feel good later or
tonight or...
(Ben drops his head...)
I’m just sayin’...I can go by
myself tomorrow. I’m a big girl.
I’ll be fine.
INT. PLANE - IN THE AIR -

THE NEXT DAY

Ben and Jules in first class, both have work on their tray
tables. Jules is on her iPad. Ben is staring at her.
Bursting, but not talking.
JULES
(finally, turns to him)
Okay! Seriously. Ben! What - isit!?!

106.
BEN
(giving up)
You know, I’m a sensitive man. I
don’t look it, people don’t think
that about me. But I am. Under all
this man stuff that you so admire,
I’m just a big bowl of mush.
JULES
I know that.
BEN
Okay!
(calming himself down)
JULES
That’s it? That’s what 24 hours of
crazy comes to? That you’re a
sensitive bowl of mush.
BEN
Jules.
(almost tells her what he
knows, changes his mind)
Jules, what are we doin’ here? We
got the day off. We’re travelin’ in
first class.
(starts packing up his
papers)
Let’s at least have a little fun.
JULES
Okay! That I get.
She snaps her iPad case shut, calls for the Flight Attendant.
INT. PLANE - A LITTLE LATER
Jules and Ben are mid-meal and getting refills on their wine.
Jules is telling Ben a story and laughing so hard, she can’t
get the story out. Ben is dying laughing. Can’t catch his
breath. He laughs, wiping away tears as Jules continues.
LATER - READY TO LAND
Jules and Ben put their seats in the upright position.
takes a deep breath.
You okay?

BEN

JULES
Yeah. Just thinking, tomorrow I
meet the guy who may become my
boss. A lot of people have bosses
right? Most people have bosses!

Jules

BEN
Jules, it’s simple. If you think
Townsend is going to be good for
you and good for the company, then
do it and if not...
JULES
-- Exactly. Just because I came
here...
BEN
Right.. Doesn’t mean....
JULES
(nods)
I agree. Do you think I can take a
Xanex if I had two glasses of wine
an hour ago?
BEN
I’d wait another couple of hours.
Jules nods. As they prepare to land, Jules closes her eyes,
kisses her fingertips, touches her eyes, nods her head,
counts to four then mumbles something that ends in the word
Amen. Ben watches.
JULES
It’s a thing I do when I land.
We’re good now.
EXT. FOUR SEASONS SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT
INT. JULES HOTEL ROOM - SAME TIME
Jules has wet hair, she’s in the hotel robe and on her iPad.
TV is on in the b.g..
Suddenly there’s a LOUD SIREN-LIKE
BEEPING coming from the hallway. Jules looks up sharply.
INT. BEN’S ROOM - SAME TIME - THE BEEPING CONTINUES
Ben is asleep with an open book on his chest.
open.

His eyes pop

EXT. FOUR SEASONS HOTEL - NIGHT
A hundred or so Hotel Guests have gathered on the street
dressed in everything from bath towels to tuxedos. Jules, in
her robe and wet hair, pushes through the crowd, relieved to
spot Ben walking toward her in his pj’s and robe.

108.
JULES
This alarm going off is not a good
omen about this guy. It’s a sign,
Ben.
BEN
I’m pretty sure it’s not. You
haven’t taken the Xanax yet.
JULES
You told me to wait two hours. You
travel with your own robe?
HOTEL MANAGER
Ladies and Gentleman, a smoke alarm
went off in one of our rooms but
the problem has been taken care of.
Our sincerest apologies.
JULES
Yep. Two hundred people, 4
elevators. Definitely a sign.
Iceberg ahead.
INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
Ben walks Jules to her room.
JULES
Thanks for escorting me back. Want
to see my room?
(Jules OPENS her door. Ben
peeks in)
I mean do you actually want to come
in? I have a tea kettle, we could
have tea...
(then)
I’m ridiculously nervous about
tomorrow.
INT. JULES'S HOTEL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Jules is pouring hot water into two mugs.
JULES
You lie down, I know you’re tired
and I’ll sit in the chair.
Ben catches the reflection of Jules's bare legs in the mirror
and looks away. He lies on the edge of the bed, one foot
planted on the floor. Jules joins him on the bed.
BEN
I thought you were going to sit in
the chair.

109.
JULES
Please let me be here.
lay down too.

I need to

Ben shakes his head as Jules joins him on the bed. A bit
awkward as they lie next to one another.
JULES (cont’d)
We don’t have to talk about work or
anything...
Alright.
about?

BEN
What should we talk

JULES
Marriage?
(Ben gets nervous, looks
over at her)
Will you tell me about your wife?
She was great, right?
BEN
She was. Molly was her name. She
was a middle school principal.
Beloved.
JULES
So perfect. Long marriage?
BEN
Not long enough.
years.

Thirty-eight

JULES
Wow. What was that like?
BEN
You know when people say they want
to grow old together?
(Jules nods)
Well, we did it. We met when we
were 20. I was 20. She was 19. What
was amazing was that she never
really changed. That’s a hard thing
to pull off. She handled life like
it was easy. Always... even when it
wasn’t.
JULES
God, I envy that.
(Ben smiles, Jules crosses
to the Mini Bar)
You hungry? We’ve got Gummy bears.
Chocolate chip cookies. Pringles.
She grabs everything and takes it all back to the bed.

110.
BEN
You know those are like $15 each.
JULES
Benjamin, I run a very big internet
company. Let’s go crazy. So...
BEN
(laughs, eating gummy
bears)
So..?
JULES
I got a weird one for you.
cheating on me.

Matt is

BEN
(almost choking)
You know about this?
JULES
What does that mean?
about it?

You know

BEN
(hates saying this)
I saw them together.
JULES
Oh, God. When?
BEN
Yesterday. I’m sorry. It was an
accident that I saw them but I did.
JULES
Yesterday?! Oh, okay, so, it is
still going on.
(slinks down in bed)
I was thinking maybe it was winding
down. Fuck! Excuse me.
It’s okay.

BEN

JULES
Thanks. FUCK!!!
BEN
How long have you known?
JULES
For like 18 days. She’s a Mom at
Paige’s school. It’s still so hard
for me to grasp. I was in the
kitchen making sandwiches and his
phone was sitting there, he was
(MORE)

111.
JULES (cont'd)
upstairs with Paige and he kept
getting all these texts. I don’t
know why, but I read them.
(starts to cry)
It was not good. I thought my heart
was going to stop. They had little
nicknames for each other. She sent
him a photo which is now forever
implanted in my brain... I guess
cell phones are going to do in all
guys eventually.
BEN
Does he know you know?
JULES
No... because, honestly I’m not
really ready to deal with it. I
would like to be a little less
devastated if that’s possible. It’s
classic, though, isn’t it? The
successful wife’s husband feels
ignored, his manhood is threatened
so he acts out. The girlfriend I
guess makes him feel more like a
man. Sometimes I think maybe I
don’t know how to do the -- make
him feel like a man thing, you
know? And anyway, is that even
what I’m supposed to do? I mean,
that’s an exhausting endeavor.
BEN
Wait, wait wait. Hold on. You’re
not actually taking the rap for any
this, are you?
JULES
No. No! He’s doing something bad.
No! Monogom-ish is not what I’m
going for. I’m just trying to wait
it out for a sec. I’m hoping it’s
just a horrible lapse in judgment
and not like, love -- and once he
gets it out of his system, we’ll be
able to eventually be okay again.
What do you think of that?
(off Ben’s look)
Clearly you don’t think that’s a
possible thing.
BEN
It would be unusual.
JULES
I get not everybody could do that
but everybody’s not us. I have
hope for us ‘cause I believe he
(MORE)

112.
JULES (cont'd)
still loves me and we’re going
through a lot right now and...
God, I wish all of your expressions
weren’t so transparent. Some
couples do survive these things.
Anyway, there’s something to be
said for getting through it.
Putting value on us and not the
affair. Also, I know you want to
say something, here’s the last
thing -- I don’t want to give up on
him ‘cause I know him and I know he
knows better. But I’m only human,
so I’m obviously so mad at him...
(tries to pull it
together)
So much has happened to us so fast,
maybe I was somehow even expecting
this. You know he was the more
successful when we started out...
BEN
No, didn’t know that.
JULES
Yeah. He was. He was a rising
star... I’m sure this is why I’m
even entertaining this whole CEO
thing... thinking maybe it will let
me get my life back on track but-BEN
-- Oh, God, okay, that’s it!
(makes the Time Out sign)
I hate to be the feminist here,
between the two of us, but you
should be able to have a huge
career and be brilliant without
having to accept your husband is
having an affair as some kind of
payback.
Right on.
I mean it.

JULES
BEN

JULES
Me too. But such is life, my
friend.
BEN
No it isn’t. Not always. And I’m
really mad at him too. Except I’m
not so forgiving.

113.
JULES
I’m not so forgiving. I’m saying I
could potentially be forgiving. But
don’t think I don’t feel what’s
happening here. It’s crushing. And
when I think of Paige...
BEN
Oh, don’t...
JULES
Also, I know if we got a divorce,
he’d remarry, not necessarily to
this girl, but someone and we know
I’m not easy, so I could be like
single forever which means and
forgive me but I think about this
sometimes in the middle of the
night...
(covers her face...)
What??

BEN

JULES
-- That I don’t want to be buried
alone. Paige will be with her
husband, Matt will be with his new
family and I’ll be buried with
strangers. I’ll be in the single
strangers section of the cemetery.
Ahhhhhh. Not that that’s a reason
to stay together, that’s just a
scary side bar...
BEN
Okay, let’s take that one off your
plate. You can be buried with me
and Molly. I happen to have room.
Okay?
JULES
(so touched, tears
streaming)
Thank you. So much. And to think
I didn’t even want to hire you...
BEN
The one time I don’t have my hanky.
JULES
(wipes her eyes on the
belt of the robe)
I’m okay. You want to see what’s on
TV? Just for a few minutes?
Yeah.

BEN
I would...

114.
Jules picks up the remote, clicks around and is relieved to
land on Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds dancing to “You Were
Meant For Me” from Singin’ in the Rain. They watch in
silence at the optimism, innocence and youthful beauty on the
screen. Ben turns to Jules, sees her eyes are shutting. Ben
watches the movie alone, happy to be lost in another world.

Ben is getting a shave.

His eyes go to the clock on the

EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREET - LATE MORNING
Ben paces in front of a town car when he spots Jules, walking
quickly out of the building, wearing sunglasses. He opens
the back door of the car. She nods, gets in. Ben joins her
in the backseat.
INT. CAR - MOVING
DRIVER
To the airport?
JULES
The airport.
Silence.
BEN
Did we like him?
JULES
(pulls out Purell)
He said everything right. Said no
one knows CTF like me. Said he
doesn’t want to remove the soul of
the company.
(Ben opens his palm for a
squirt of Purell)
He said he doesn’t have a plan,
wants to watch us and see what
works. He was polite, he was
respectful, he was super smart and
I hired him.
Seriously?

BEN
You did it in the room?

JULES
He told me to sleep on it and we’ll
talk tomorrow but I told him the
job was his. We shook hands on it.
(then)
(MORE)

115.
JULES (cont'd)
You know if we disagree on
something... he’s the tie breaker.
BEN
Of course. He’s the CEO.
JULES
Matt’ll be happy.
Ben lowers his window a couple of inches, turns toward the
fresh air.
INT. JULES'S FOYER - THAT NIGHT
Matt bounds down the stairs as Jules ENTERS. He kisses her
hello.
Hey.

JULES
You smell minty.

MATT
I just made mint tea.
No?

So?

Yes?

JULES
I did it. I liked him a lot and I
offered him the job.
MATT
Wow. Really?
(Matt hugs her)
Congratulations.
JULES
Yeah. I think it’ll be good for us.
Do we have like any real booze?
Like vodka or something?
ON THE STAIRS - A MOMENT LATER
Jules sits on the stairs. Matt joins her with two glasses of
Vodka.
MATT
Did good for us mean CTF or us?
JULES
You and me us. If someone else can
call some of the shots at work,
then maybe we can get back to where
we were 18 months ago. They say
you can’t get the genie back in the
bottle, but we can try. Right?
Matt turns to her but neither says a word.

116.
INT. JULES BATHROOM - THAT NIGHT
Jules lies in the bathtub, wiped out. She looks over at the
sink, sees two toothbrushes in a cup, then to the back of the
door -- Matt’s robe hangs on the hook. She shuts her eyes
for a sec, rubs her chest, tries to calm her breathing.
A
few of Paige’s bath toys sit on the tub ledge. Jules picks
up a little frog, winds it up, places it in the tub and
watches it flip around. Her eyes fill with tears.
INT. BEDROOM - SAME TIME
Matt lies across the bottom of the bed, wishing his life
wasn’t crumbling. He sits up, faces the closed bathroom
door, wants to do the right thing, but can’t seem to get up
and go in there. His phone pings - he has a text. He
doesn’t look at it.
EXT. BEN’S HOUSE - EARLY A.M.
A Cab pulls up. Jules steps out and walks up the front path
just as Davis EXITS in a suit, carrying a brief case.
JULES
Wait, you live here?
DAVIS
Oh. Hi! Yeah, Ben’s been putting me
up ‘til I find a place. Should I
tell him you’re here?
JULES
That’s okay, I’ll knock.
Jules KNOCKS on the FRONT DOOR and in a sec, Fiona answers.
JULES (cont’d)
(stunned)
Fiona??
FIONA
(surprised)
Hi Jules. Come on in.
Fiona opens the door and we find Ben, clearing the breakfast
dishes.
FIONA (cont’d)
I’m just on my way to work, I’ll
let you two talk.
Fiona grabs her tote, crosses to Ben, gives him a kiss on the
cheek. Ben smiles softly as she heads out.

117.
Now alone with Ben, Jules remains in the Living Room, a
distance away.
Hi.

BEN

JULES
Wow. You and Fiona. Who knew?
BEN
She’s a great gal. She surprised
me last night. Brought over dinner.
It’s... brand new.
Congrats.

JULES
I love her.

Jules pauses, putting all that together, then rolls on.
JULES (cont’d)
So, I was ready kind of early
today. Since about four... and
Matt and Paige left an hour ago for
a field trip so thought I’d come
by, hope that’s okay. Just wanted
to say I slept on it, I haven’t
called Townsend yet but I still
think it’s the right thing to do.
BEN
I didn’t sleep so well myself.
Over this?

JULES

BEN
You remember the day I drove you to
the warehouse? You were giving me
the wrong directions and...
JULES
I remember.
BEN
Okay, well, I stood in the back and
watched you show the workers how to
fold and box the clothes. I knew
then, that was why CTF was a
success. No one else is ever going
to have that kind of commitment to
your company Jules. To me, it’s
pretty simple. CTF needs you and
if you don’t mind me saying - you
need it. Someone may come in with
more experience than you, but
they’re never going to know what
you know. I never had something
(MORE)

118.
BEN (cont'd)
like this in my career. Not many
people do. This big, beautiful,
intricate thing that you created -it’s a dream isn’t it? And you’re
going to give that up in the hopes
that your husband will stop having
an affair? I don’t see how that
adds up. You should feel nothing
but great about what you’ve done.
Don’t let anybody take that away
from you.
(Jules wipes a tear from
her cheek)
I guess you came over here ‘cause
you wanted to hear some of this...
JULES
Yeah, I did. And maybe also ‘cause
you’re my...
(she can’t quite say it)
Intern.

BEN

JULES
I was going to say...
(mumbles)
Intern/Slash/Best friend, but no
need to get all sentimental even
though we could potentially be
buried together. Can’t get closer
than that and I think it’s moments
like this when you need someone who
you know you can count on. So
thank you for that.
(Ben nods)
I like your house so much by the
way.
Thank you.

BEN

They both take the time to think about what was just said.
BEN (cont’d)
So. Shall we?
INT. CTF - FOLLOWING
Ben and Jules get off the elevator together. Just another
day for everyone else. Becky, looking fresh and relaxed
greets them, carrying an iPad.
BECKY
Welcome back you two. Jules, got
something cool to show you.
(clicks on a Photo)
(MORE)

119.
BECKY (cont'd)
Do you remember taking a customer
service call about a Bride whose
bridesmaids’ dresses all showed up
in grey and you had the Vendor
remake them overnight and we put
them on a plane and -JULES
-- Yeah, yeah...Rachel!
BECKY
Check this out.
Becky shows Jules a PHOTO of RACHEL and her BRIDESMAIDS lined
up in their Pink Dresses.
JULES
The silk chiffon Antoinette dress.
They look beautiful.
Jules and Ben arrive at their cubicles. There’s a huge
arrangement of Peonies on Jules's desk. She hopes they’re
from Matt.
BECKY
Also, these just arrived from Ted
Townsend. Here’s the card.
JULES
(reading the card)
Get me Townsend’s number will you?
Ben watches Jules then checks his watch. Jules's PHONE RINGS.
JULES (cont’d)
This is Jules. Hey Alonzo, what’s
up? Okay, uh-huh, do we need that
many?
Jules feels someone standing over her. Looks up.
He looks like he may have run to get here.
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM
Jules and Matt stand in the Conference Room.
MATT
Don’t do this for me, Jules.
Please. Do what feels right for
you.
JULES
Oh, God. I want to continue
running my company Matt -- you
gotta know that.

It’s Matt.

120.
MATT
Then do it. I don’t want you to be
unhappy.
JULES
I’m already unhappy.
That came out too fast to take back.
MATT
Because of me?
She looks at him in a way that reveals what she’s been going
through. His eyes fill with tears.
JULES
Is it almost over ‘cause I don’t
know how much longer I can -MATT
It is over. I love you Jules and I
don’t know how to say this any
better than to tell you how deeply
sorry I am. I’m so ashamed of
myself and what I did to us... I
will do so much better at this. If
you’ll let me.
Jules openly cries now.
sure what to do.

Matt waits for her response, not

If you

MATT
I’ll buy some.
A long look at one another. So much to say...
Okay...

JULES

And through her exhaustion and tears, the smallest of smiles
and a nod make their way through.
MATT
Thank you...
(wiping away his tears)
Have you called Townsend yet
because if I ever met anyone who
didn’t need a boss -- it was you.
JULES
-- I was just about to call him and
tell him I changed my mind. I
(MORE)

121.
JULES (cont'd)
mean, we’re good here. We’ll make
it. I’m gonna make sure we make it.
MATT
Good. And maybe you could offer him
the job of COO, under you... let
him make the trains run on time and
report to you.
JULES
He won’t take that.
MATT
But somebody will.
JULES
(wiping her tears)
Yeah...
MATT
I’m sorry, Jules, but I gotta get
back to the field trip. I’m in
charge of snacks and...
Jules nods and Matt hesitates then hugs her in a way that
finally relaxes them both.
INT. OFFICES - MOMENTS LATER
Jules quickly zigzags around the desks, arriving at Ben’s
desk. He’s not there.
JULES
Becky, where’s Ben?
BECKY
Not sure. Said he’s taking the day
off.
INT. FIONA’S ROOM - DIMLY LIT

The door opens, Jules

JULES
Fiona, do you know where Ben is?
EXT. PROSPECT PARK - DAY
Ben’s Tai Chi group, all in sync, move slowly toward the
right, arms raised. Ben is among them. Jules approaches.
Ben doesn’t see her at first. She joins the group, standing
awkwardly near Ben.

122.
JULES
(whispers)
Sorry to interrupt.
Ben motions for her to be silent, then to get next to him.
She does.
BEN
(whispers)
Extend your left arm, Jules. Bend
your knees, breathe and relax.
(Jules drops her shoulder
bag, tries it)
For inner balance...
JULES
(not quite getting it)
Am I doing it right?
Almost.

BEN

Jules tries harder.
JULES
I have something good to tell you.
BEN
Tell me when we’re done.
Okay.

JULES

BEN
Breathe deeply, Jules...
And as Jules follows Ben and tries her best to achieve inner
balance, CAMERA DRIFTS and slowly we:
FADE OUT.
