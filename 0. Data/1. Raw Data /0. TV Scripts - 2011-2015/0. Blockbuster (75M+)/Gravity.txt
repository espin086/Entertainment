Well, Medical doesn't agree, Doc.
Are you feeling nauseous?
RYAN (V.O.)

Not any more than usual, Houston.
Diagnostics are green. Link to
communications card ready for data
reception. If this works, when we
touch down tomorrow, I’m buying
all you guys a round of drinks.
MISSION CONTROL (V.O.)

That’s a date, Doctor. Just
remember, Houston’s partial to

MATT (V.O.) (CONT'D)
I’d been up here for forty-two
days. Every time I passed over
Texas, I looked down knowing that
Mrs. Kowalski was looking up,
thinking of me. Six weeks I’m
blowing kisses at that woman.
Then we land at Edwards and I find
out that she’s run off with this
lawyer. So, I packed my car, and
I headed to --

MISSION CONTROL (V.O.)
(over radio;
interrupting)
Tijuana. You’ve told this story,
Kowalski. As Houston recalls,
she, uh, took off in your seventyfour GTO. Engineering requests
fuel status on the jetpack
prototype.
MATT KOWALSKI, a veteran astronaut commander on his last
space mission, spacewalks behind the shuttle. He wears a
propulsion backpack.
MATT (V.O.)
(over radio)
Five hours off the reservation and
I show thirty percent drain. Give
my compliments to Engineering.
Except for a slight malfunction in
the nulling of the roll axis, this
jetpack is one prime piece of
thrust.
MISSION CONTROL (V.O.)
(over radio)
Engineering says thank you.
CAMERA TILTS UP WITH Matt.
MATT (V.O.)
(over radio)
Tell ‘em I still prefer my sixtyseven Corvette, though. Speaking
of which, did I ever tell you -MISSION CONTROL (V.O.)

We know the Corvette story, Matt.

Even Engineering?

Matt starts to play a country western song over the radio
speakers. He moves, circling around the space shuttle.
Over radio, Hank Williams, Jr. sings “Angels Are Hard To
Find.”
MISSION CONTROL (V.O.)

We’re going to miss you, Matt.
RYAN (V.O.)

DR. SHARIFF DASARI becomes visible, tethered to the
shuttle, as he makes repairs to it.
MISSION CONTROL (V.O.)

Shariff, what’s your status?
SHARIFF (V.O.)
(over radio)
Nearly there. Replacing battery
module A-one and C.
MISSION CONTROL (V.O.)
(over radio)
Uh, could you be a little more
specific? Indeterminate estimates
make Houston anxious.
SHARIFF (V.O.)
(over radio)
Oh, no, no, Houston. Don’t be
anxious. Anxiety’s not good for
the heart. System is ready to
reactivate.

Shariff starts dancing.
SHARIFF (V.O.)

Matt, do you have a visual on just
what Mission Specialist Shariff is
doing up there?
Matt moves around Shariff.
MATT (V.O.)
(over radio)
He appears to be doing some form
of the Macarena.
(off Shariff’s laugh)
But that would be just a bestguess scenario on my part.
CAMERA TILTS DOWN and DOLLIES IN ON DR. RYAN STONE, a
medical engineer on her first mission. She is on a cranelike robotic arm attached to the shuttle. She is focused
on a communication card panel on the Hubble.
MISSION CONTROL (V.O.)
(over radio)
Dr. Stone, Houston. Medical now
have you with a temperature drop
to thirty-five-point-nine and a
heart-rate rise to seventy. How
are you feeling?
RYAN (V.O.)
(over radio)
Houston, I’m fine. It’s just

is harder than it looks.

MISSION CONTROL (V.O.)
(over radio)
Uh, Dr. Stone, Medical is asking
if you want to return to Explorer.
RYAN (V.O.)

Negative. We’ve been here a week,
Houston. Let’s just finish this.
(clears throat)
Card is up.
MISSION CONTROL (V.O.)
(over radio)
Uh, no, that’s a negative. I’m
afraid we’re getting nothing on
this end, Doctor.
RYAN (V.O.)

No, still nothing.
RYAN (V.O.)

music off.
MISSION CONTROL (V.O.)

Not a problem.
Matt turns the music off.
RYAN (V.O.)
(over radio)
Thank you, Kowalski. Now,
Houston?
MISSION CONTROL (V.O.)
(over radio)
That’s a negative.
RYAN (V.O.)
(over radio)
Could Houston be misinterpreting
the data?

CONTINUED:

MISSION CONTROL (V.O.)
(over radio)
Well, we’re not receiving any
data. Engineering is recommending
a vis-check for component damage.
Ryan takes a card out and examines it.
RYAN (V.O.)
(over radio)
Let me see what’s going on. What
have we got?
(to Mission Control)
Visual examination doesn’t reveal
any damaged components. The
problem must be originating from
the comms panel.
MISSION CONTROL (V.O.)
(over radio)
Yeah, that seems to be the case.
Engineering admits that you warned
us that this could happen. That’s
as close to an apology as you’re
going to get from them. We should
have listened to you, Doc.
RYAN (V.O.)
(over radio)
Get working.
MISSION CONTROL (V.O.)
(over radio)
Well, looks like we’re going to
have to improvise.
Matt moves INTO FRAME.
RYAN (V.O.)

I’m on it.

know you don’t care about things
like this, but, uh, for your
information, this delay is not
gonna be long enough for you to
break Anatoly Solovyev’s

Like a Chihuahua that’s being

MATT
(chuckles softly)
Well, it’s been a rough week. If
it makes you feel any better, I
coughed up everything but my
kidneys on my first ride.
RYAN
Shit.
Ryan drops a bolt, which floats as Matt reaches out to
grab it. Matt moves to Ryan and gives the bolt to her.
They work together on removing the panel.
RYAN
Sorry. I’m used to a basement lab
in a hospital where things fall to
the floor.
(chuckles softly)
Thank you.
MATT
Well, you’re the genius up here.
I only drive the bus.
RYAN
Yeah, well, call me a genius if I
can get this board initialized in
the next hour.

The impact has created a cloud of
debris orbiting at twenty thousand

on any developments.
EXPLORER CAPTAIN (V.O.)

Copy that, Houston.

Should we -- Should we be worried?
MATT
No, let’s let the boys down there
worry for us.
RYAN
Explorer, engage arm and pivot to
cargo bay.
EXPLORER CAPTAIN (V.O.)

Stand by for arm maneuver.
The robotic arm begins to move very slowly, pulling Ryan
and Matt along.
MATT
So, doc, now that you work for
NASA, how do you like us?
SHARIFF
Kind of like winning the lottery,
huh?
Shariff chuckles.
RYAN

I was just happy that they didn’t
cut the funding to my research.

How long was your training?

Oh, six months.
SHARIFF
Including holidays?

Ryan moves.

Matt unclips a cable.

MATT
So, what is this scanning system?
SHARIFF
Oh, nothing Matt. It’s just a new
set of eyes to scan the edge of
the universe.
Matt holds the cable.
RYAN
It’s designed for hospital use,
but this one’s a prototype.
EXPLORER CAPTAIN (V.O.)
(over radio)
Stand by for locking.
Matt and Ryan begin to remove another panel.
MATT
Listen, they don’t bankroll
prototypes. Even for your pretty
blue eyes.
RYAN
Well, my eyes are brown.
MATT
Right now, your eyes are
bloodshot.
She chuckles.
SHARIFF
Kowalski! Is this great, or what?
Woo-hoo-hoo!
Matt and Ryan turn to see Shariff jump and float away
from the shuttle. His safety tether tenses and snaps him
back. Matt glances upward.
MATT
And to think he went to Harvard.
You gotta admit one thing: Can’t

You’re the expert, doctor. It’s
your call.
MATT
Houston, I have a bad feeling
about this mission.
MISSION CONTROL (V.O.)
(over radio)
Please elaborate.
MATT
It’s the same feeling I had about
Mardi Gras in 1987.
MISSION CONTROL (V.O.)
(over radio)
That is affirmative.
Surprisingly, Control hasn’t heard
the Mardi Gras story. Please
proceed.
Matt and Ryan work the panel.
MATT
Well, it’s day one, and I’m
bumping my way down Bourbon Street
looking for a sister of a friend
of mine. Streets are full of
people. I’m thinking there’s no

Matt flies back and forth as he tries to correct their

back and forth.
Where is he?

RYAN
Where is he?

Matt ignites the thrusters and speeds in b.g. toward the

stopping his trajectory. Ryan flies past him toward
