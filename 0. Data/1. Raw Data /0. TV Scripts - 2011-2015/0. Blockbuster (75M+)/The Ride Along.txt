Copyright (c) 2013 This screenplay may not be used or reproduced
without the express written permission of the author.

Fade In:

1. INT. BRIEFING ROOM- NIGHT.
A good sized room with a projector screen in front and a mix of
40 STUDENTS AND PARENTS. CARL BROMAN, late 50s with a very
serious demeanor, sits to the right of the projector screen.
There is a LAPTOP in front of him and a PowerPoint presentation
on the projector screen. This is a summer orientation for
upcoming high school seniors who are interested in becoming
Emergency Medical Technicians.
Carl Broman:
Make no mistake about it ladies and
gentleman. What you are now and how you
act now has a rapidly approaching
expiration date. This course is unlike
any you have ever taken before. It will
be your favorite and least favorite
class you ever take. You all are going
to be high school seniors! A very
relaxed and enjoyable year, right? If
you want easy than leave now and please
drop this class. If you want enjoyable
than look elsewhere because this will
be a grind that you can only hope
doesn’t leave you mentally, physically,
and socially exhausted by the time you
graduate next May.
Switch to POV of Mr. Broman. He glances around the room.
Carl Broman (cont’d):
This meeting tonight is the beginning
of the end of your teenage immaturity.

The minute you step into that classroom
in the fall you are no longer children.
You are adults, and will be treated
like it. Being an Emergency Medical
Technician is not something I, or any
person in need, wants a high school kid
for. Because this is not like your math
class where you make a mistake and get
a red “X” as a result. If you make a
mistake out there, in the field, people
could die. (A Pause) And parents if all
that scares you than you raised a good
kid.
2. INT. BRIEFING ROOM- NIGHT.
Cut to after the meeting. KEVIN STARR is an ordinary looking
high school senior. He is about 6 feet, short blonde hair, and
skinny.
He walks to CHLOE MCDAID, a very pretty girl with long
strawberry blonde hair and a smile that could make a person’s
day.
Kevin:
Are you enjoying your summer so far
Chloe?
Chloe:
Apparently not. Well at least not if
it’s my last summer I’m allowed to be a
kid for
Chloe glances towards Mr. Broman.
Kevin:
I wouldn’t worry too much about all of
that. An orientation meeting for a
class like this has a sole purpose to
scare the weak-minded enough so they
don’t waste anyone’s time. We had Mrs.
Cruise together last year, and if we
can survive that class I am pretty
confident that not even God could
strike us down if he wanted to.

Chloe:
Yeah, maybe, but doesn’t that stuff
about “making a mistake can kill
someone” not scare you? It terrifies
me.
Kevin:
I don’t let it. I mean, what’s the
worst that could happen?
Chloe:
Do you really want me to answer that?
Kevin:
Fear does no one good if you let it
change the way you think. (A pause)
Think about it. You get in your car
tomorrow but you don’t think if you
make a mistake you might kill someone.
Sure, you thought like that once, when
you first learned to drive, but with
instruction and experience your fear
was erased. For people, not knowing is
the scariest part. That is what will
always scare me if I let it, but I’m
sure going through the class will teach
me all I need to know for that fear to
be buried in the back of mind.

Chloe:
You’re not nearly as smart as you think
you are. Fear can sometimes be a good
thing, ya know. Without it you don’t
succeed. You don’t live, you don’t
reach your dreams and you don’t feel
alive. Without fear we’re mindless
creatures without a purpose or reality.
That fear that we’ll be feeling lets us
know that we’re human, and all humans

fear suffering. Even (air quotes)
‘tough guys’ like yourself.
Kevin:
This is too philosophical for the
summer. Try me again if three weeks.
Chloe:
A classic Kevin Starr deflection.
Anyways my parents are probably waiting
for me in the car. I’ll text you later.
(A pause) Oh, and enjoy the rest of
your last summer as a kid.
Chloe walks away smiling.
3.

INT. CAR- NIGHT.
We see Kevin and his mom, MRS. STARR, in the CAR. She is late
40s and clearly has hair that has been dyed blonde too many
times.
Mrs. Starr:
So Kevin, do you think you’re ready for
this? It sounds like some serious stuff
and I just want to know if you think
you can handle it. I mean, last week
when the cable went out you decided to
put pillows at the bottom of the stairs
and then jump from the top. Hardly EMTlike.
Kevin:
Haha, yeah… You know that helping
people has always been what I want to
do. Being an EMT is as helpful as
helpful gets, at least for a high
school senior.
Mom:
Just remember that this will be a lot
of time and work, and that graduating
high school comes first.

Kevin:
Yeah, yeah, it’ll be easy, don’t worry
about it. (A pause) Can we get pizza?
Mom:
No.
Kevin:
(Little kid voice) But mom I want
pizza. I want it, I want it, I want it!
Mrs. Starr sighs and says:
Mrs. Starr:
Fine…
4. EXT. HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT- DAY.
Kevin and Chloe both get out of Kevin’s CAR and shut the doors.
They both have their BACKPACKS and first day of schools clothes
on. They walk towards ELLICOTT CITY HIGH SCHOOL, an old, large,
brick building.
Chloe:
Oh, also we’re apparently allowed to
drive to the EMT class from school. We
don’t have to ride the bus to and from
it. That way we can just leave from the
class and don’t have to go back to
school.
Kevin:
Alright, that sounds great.
They stop in front of the entrance of the school and look up.
Chloe:
Three years down, one to go.
5. EXT. EMT ACADEMY PARKING LOT- DAY.
Cut to: Kevin and Chloe once again getting out of his car with
their backpacks, this time in the EMT Academy parking lot. The
building is rather new and artsy looking. Chloe and Kevin are
walking towards it.

Kevin:
Leadership will be a joke. We have like
two assignments all year and there both
vocal presentations about topics you’re
passionate about. So that and piano are
my two easy classes.

6. INT. EMT ACADEMY MAIN HALLWAY- DAY.
Kevin and Chloe enter the building. They make a left and head
down a hallway.
Chloe:
I hate you. All my teachers seem super
serious. My food teacher’s syllabus was
basically a “I was a head chef for ten
years, look how great I am,” and a list
of the exotic suburbia food that
probably doesn’t exist that we’ll have
to make. Bitch, if you were a head chef
for ten years you are not teaching high
school Food and Nutrition by choice.
7. INT. EMT CLASSROOM- DAY.
Chloe and Kevin walk in the classroom. It isn’t as big as you
might expect. The first half is of DESKS and CHAIRS, while the
second half is stacked with MANNEQUINS, BOXES of BANDAGES,
GAUZE, and GLOVES, LONG BACKBOARDS, strange looking gadgets and
machines, and lots of SPLINTS. It looked like a hurricane had
just hit. There was only a small sliver that connected the two
halves together that you could walk on. Kevin and Chloe were the
first two to arrive.
Mr. Broman:
Welcome to the class guys. If you would
please sign in over there and then grab
a textbook, a protocol manual, a
stethoscope and blood pressure cuff.
Then take a seat and we will await for
the others.

About 10 minutes passed before everyone had arrived. The date on
the front board reads September 1st. Mr. Broman is at the head of
the classroom and quiets everyone up.
Mr. Broman:
Welcome to Emergency Medical Technician
Basic class. This is my 10th year
teaching this class, and so far it has
been a success. There are 21 of you
guys and girls to start this year. That
number is going to drop, a lot, in the
coming weeks. Some of you won’t be able
to handle the work load. Some of you
won’t be physically handle the demands,
and some of you will have your
priorities in different places. Look at
what is in front of you, on your desk.
We will go through all of that, and
most of it will have to be memorized.
Now then, without further ado, let’s
begin.
8. INT. CHLOE’S BEDROOM- NIGHT.
Kevin and Chloe are in Chloe’s bedroom, not very teenage girllike, with their books and equipment from the day spread all
over the floor.
Kevin:
Jesus Christ! This is like 1500 pages
worth of material that we will have to
know for our state boards in May. Mr.
Broman wasn’t kidding at orientation
when he said say goodbye to your social
lives.
Chloe:
Now, I do believe that Kevin Starr is
stressed. This is a sight that we may
never see again.
Kevin:
Oh haha you smartass. We have to get
through 165 hours of in class

instruction, and we have 170 days to do
it. Plus we have our ride times that
start in December, and we need to go on
at least 10 calls. Then consider that
we have to pass 10 module tests, and if
we get lower than a 70 on any of them,
we cannot take the state boards. So how
would you like to get to April only to
fail our last module test before our
state boards? I would be pretty pissed
if that happens. So yes all this
material and all these conditions of
the class do stress me out a little.
Chloe:
Yeah. I’d say that I am a bit scared,
but I know how much that would set you
off.
Kevin glares at Chloe, only to see her smiling back. He then
looks less tense.
Chloe (cont’d):
We got this.
Kevin:
Haha alright. However if this doesn’t
work out I’ll blame you for filling my
head with false hope.

9. INT. EMT CLASS- DAY.
Two weeks have now passed: The date on the board reads September
16th. Mr. Broman is now having a serious discussion outside with
four students. Almost everyone was watching. Mr. Broman walks
in, and goes straight to his desk and sits. Without ever looking
up her says:
Mr. Broman:
Starting tomorrow we will be without
four students. I don’t know if they
misheard me when I said you actually

have to study, or just didn’t care, but
either way they will not be returning.
No one said a word.
10. INT. HIGH SCHOOL CAFETERIA- DAY.
Kevin, and Chloe are seated across from each other at a semicrowded table. Chloe is eating a sandwich. Kevin has a tray of
food in front of him from the school lunch line. Kevin looks
around the cafeteria.
Kevin:
Why are so many girls now only eating
salads for lunch? That can’t be good
for you.
Chloe:
They’re stupid girls. And it’s
incredibly bad for you to only eat a
salad. Bitches don’t realize that.
Kevin:
Seems really dumb.
Chloe:
And gross.
Chloe takes a huge bite out of her sandwich.
Chloe (cont’d):
Mmmmmm Carbs
Kevin smiles. He grabs a chicken nugget from his tray and takes
a bite. He stops chewing, stares at the chicken nugget, puts it
back on his tray and shivers in disgust.
Kevin:
So why do they call chicken nuggets
chicken nuggets? What is a nugget
anyway?

Chloe:
It’s like a piece of gold.

Kevin:
Huh. I guess that’s smart marketing.
Combine two of man’s favorite things:
money and food. These things on my tray
though are like chickens nugget’s third
cousin had a mutated baby that had a
lovechild with a pile of shit.
Chloe:
You’ve been going to this school three
years. How have you not realized by
now?
Kevin:
I just really like chicken nuggets. I
just get so hopeful every time.
Kevin sulks his head as he says that. Chloe puts her hand on
Kevin’s shoulder:
Chloe:
It’s going to be alright.
Kevin:
Thanks.
Chloe:
Anyway, you’re driving me to the park
on Saturday. I need to get in shape of
track.
Kevin:
Do I have a say in the matter?
Chloe:
No. I’m not going to be stuck in my
house all day while my brothers blast
college football on the surround sound
for twelve hours. So pick me up at
around noon.
Kevin:
Fine.

11. EXT. A PARK- DAY.
Kevin and Chloe just finished up a run around the PARK. It was
pretty empty for mid-day on a Saturday. Kevin has his headphones
in. Chloe says something but Kevin does not hear it. Chloe pulls
out his headphones.
Chloe:
I said, do you want any water?
Kevin grabs the WATER BOTTLE and takes a sip. Chloe grabs his
IPOD, and starts scrolling through it.
Chloe:
Holy shit, you actually have a playlist
titled “EMT motivation?”
Kevin:
Yes. It’s filled with songs that all
have to do with loss, and helplessness,
and some classic pump up songs.
Chloe:
Jesus Christ, you couldn’t sound any
nerdier right now. Plus you are
tempting fate with that playlist.
Kevin:
What’s the worst that will happen?
A bloodcurdling scream ripples through the park.
Girl:
Please, somebody help! Please help! My
dad. . . somebody help!
Chloe:
Call 911, Kevin!

Chloe sprints towards the hysterical screams to help.
Chloe:
What happened?
Girl:
I-I don’t know. One minute we were
jogging together. . . and the next he
collapsed. He won’t wake up.
Chloe:
Alright, my friend over there is
calling 911, I just need you to step
back and give your dad some room.
Chloe stares at the man’s face. She checks the man’s pulse.
After that she does nothing. You see fear start to emerge on her
face. She looks up towards Kevin, terror in her eyes.
11. Ext. Park-20 minutes later. Day
Cut to twenty minutes later. There is no evidence that anything
out of the ordinary occurred, other than a cop car near the
scene. Chloe is sitting on a bench staring into space.
Kevin:
You did great Chloe.
Chloe looked up at Kevin, but did not speak. She looked empty.
Kevin (cont’d):
You took action, took control of the
situation and then tried to save that
maChloe:
That dead man. (A pause)I know CPR.
We’ve reviewed it in class. I had to
learn it for lifeguarding last year.
And babysitting the year before that. I
know CPR. (A pause) And the look the
looks the EMTs gave me when they
arrived and saw I hadn’t done anything.
It was like ice. (A pause)I know CPR.

Kevin looked at Chloe, sadness in his eyes. He joined her on the
bench and hugged her.
12. INT. EMT CLASSROOM- DAY.
Chloe was not in class Monday. Her seat remained empty next to
him. An ordinary day.
Cut to: Tuesday. Chloe was not in class Tuesday. Her seat
remained empty.
Cut to: Kevin practicing CPR intensely on a mannequin.
13. INT. KEVIN’S CAR- DAY.
You see Kevin get in his car. He gets his phone out and dials a
number. Chloe picks up.
Intercut- Kevin’s car/Chloe’s bedroom.
Kevin:
Hey Chloe. Are you alright? You haven’t
been in class this week. I just want to
make sure what happened over the
weekend isn’t bothering you.

Chloe:
No, no. I’m fine, I promise. I really
have been sick the last couple days. I
feel like I’m getting better, so I’ll
probably be in school tomorrow.
Kevin:
Oh, really? Well that’s good.
Chloe:
Yeah, it’s so good that I’ve been sick!
Kevin:
You know what I meant. You want me to
swing buy and bring you anything?
Chloe:
No, I’m good. Thank you though. So I’ll
see you tomorrow.

Kevin:
Okay, see you then.
Kevin and Chloe hang up. Kevin stares out his window for a few
seconds and then starts his car.
14. INT. STARR HOUSE KITCHEN- NIGHT.
Kevin is having dinner with his two sisters, Stella and Kacie,
and his mom. Stella, 22, is tall with long black hair and brown
eyes. Kacie, 20, looks like she could be Kevin’s twin. An
ordinary family dinner.
Kevin:
So Stella, when do you go back to
school?
Stella:
December 2nd. Then a week of classes and
we’re home again. (A pause) When do you
start going on the ambulance?

Kevin:
About two weeks.
Stella:
Are you excited? Nervous? Terrified?

Kevin:
We’ll find out. I’m about as minimally
prepared as a person can legally be and
still be a ride-along. So, you know,
that doesn’t strike confidence in any
of my classmates.
Kacie:
You aren’t scared of all the blood,
guts, and death?
Mrs. Starr:

We’re eating dinner Kacie, shut it.
Kevin:
(A pause)You can’t be. If you’re
terrified of the worst case scenario
than only one thing is certain, and
that is the worst case scenario is
always right around the corner. That’s
the quickest way to burn yourself out
and having to settle for some joke
degree like elementary education.
Kevin and Stella both smile and look at Kacie, an obvious joke
on her.
Kacie:
Fuck you.
Mrs. Starr:
Your future students are so lucky to
have you.

Kacie:
Fuck you twice.

Kevin:
I mean, I think I’ll be fine. There is
not a whole lot I can imagine that
would truly bother me out there.
Stella:
You’re not scared of blood, or gore,
and you want to help people. We all
know that, but no one grows up this
fast.

Stella (cont’d):
If in two weeks you get a call where, I
don’t know, Chloe gets beaten half to

death and raped, do you really think
you’d be just fine? It’s not the
content of the injuries that would
frighten me, it’s the context. Sure a
small child breaks a bone falling down
the stairs, no big deal. But what if it
turns out she was pushed by her abusive
father. That would bother me more than
any injury.
Kevin:
You’re going to be a social worker
though. That’s how you’re supposed to
think. You deal with the aftermath of
the injury, and I’ll deal with the
present state of the emergency. Yes,
child abuse, or rape, or a bystander
getting hit by a car might bother me.
But all I have to do is to make sure
they are alive, and stable when they
get to the hospital. Everything after
that is you.
Both Kacie and Mrs. Starr stopped eating and were attentively
following the conversation.
Stella:
Fair enough. (A slight pause) But for
real, you’re going to be my doctor when
you get your EMT license. I’m not
paying some damn copay if I got a
somewhat knowledgeable medical asset in
the family.
Kevin:
Whatever you say. I just hope my first
call isn’t something stupid like “I
haven’t pooped in three days.”
Apparently that’s a common one.
Kacie:
Nah, you’ll get the opposite of that.
Explosive diarrhea I’ll bet.

And with that Mrs. Starr picks up her plate and heads towards
the sink.

Mrs. Starr:
Thanksgiving is tomorrow. You’re your
father’s kids if you misbehave tomorrow
at my sister’s place.
15. INT. EMT CLASSROOM- DAY.
You see T-SHIRTS on everyone’s desk. They all say “Fire and
Rescue” on the back and have the county emblem on the front.
Chloe and Kevin are on the ground taking vitals on each other.
Chloe:
So when is your first ride-along?
Kevin:
Tomorrow at 7. Station 9 I believe.
Yours?
Chloe:
Tomorrow at 6:30. Station 7. Can you
give me a ride?
Kevin:
Sure.
Chloe:
Almost four months of preparation
leading up to this. You ready for the
show?
Kevin:
Please. I was born ready.
16. INT. KEVIN’S CAR- NIGHT.
Kevin is sitting in his car in front on the fire station. The
clock reads 6:56. You see sweat on Kevin’s forehead, as well as

him tapping his steering wheel, almost like a nervous tick.
Kevin takes a deep breath, grabs his BACKPACK and gets out of
the car.
17. EXT. FIRE STATION PARKING LOT. NIGHT.
Kevin is wearing his full ride-along uniform, which is the same
as a standard EMT uniform. Fire and Rescue T-Shirt, navy blue
dress pants, black work boots, a watch, and a belt.
This fire station is a moderate sized building. It is very old
and has four huge mechanical garage doors.
Kevin walks up to the front door and rings it. You see him
swallow deeply. A man opens the door.
Captain Davies:
Yes?
Kevin:
I’m here for my ride-along.
Captain Davies:
Well come on in then! I am Captain
Raymond Davies.
The Captain extends his hand.
Kevin:
Kevin Starr.
Kevin extends his hand and he walks inside.
18. INT. FIRE STATION 9- NIGHT.
The Captain leads Kevin to the Dining area, where some people
are hanging out, chatting.
Captain Davies:
Miller, Thompson, I have here a ridealong for you tonight.
Jessica Miller, 27, was short, maybe 5’3’’, with brown, wavy
hair in a ponytail. She has a glowing personality. Brody
Thompson, 38, 6’2’’, was a well-built man with a very Irish
accent. He seemed more serious.
Captain Davies:

Alright Kevin, we have here Jessica
Miller, and Brody Thompson. They will
be your preceptors tonight. Learn all
you can from them. (To Miller and
Thompson) Don’t scare him.
The Captain walks away.
Jessica Miller:
Pleased to meet you. How long are you
here until?
Kevin:
10.
Jessica Miller:
Good. Are you ready to party?
Brody Thompson:
No, he’s not ready. Look at him. He
looks tense, sweating, probably frozen
in fear. Is this your first ride along
shift, friend?

Kevin:
Yes sir.
Jessica Miller:
(To Thompson) We can get him ready.
What say you?
Brody Thompson:
I don’t know. He’s at mixer level right
now. We’re going to have to give it our
all if we want him at party level.
Kevin looks at them confused. Thompson and Miller look back at
him, studying him closely. All of a sudden Thompson starts to
laugh.
Thompson:

Oh we’re just messing with you lad.
We’ll get you through this shift. My
question to you, though, is are you
willing to learn to dance?
Kevin:
I am.
Thompson:
Excellent. Now we wait for the party.
19. EXT. FRONT YARD OF SMALL SUBURBAN HOME. NIGHT.
Cut to Chloe, and her two male preceptors walk towards the front
door of a small suburban home.
Frank Delmonico:
Alright sweet cheeks, don’t do anything
crazy, or speak unless I tell you.
Preceptor Phil laughs. Frank Delmonico turns around and knocks
on the front door.
Chloe looks at the back of Preceptors 1 head with disgust and
disbelief. A short, chubby middle aged woman answers the door.
Ava Leigh:
Oh thank you for coming so quickly.
She walks outside and shuts the door behind her.
Ava Leigh (cont’d):
I’m Ava. Ava Leigh.
Preceptor Phil:
What is the emergency ma’am?
Ava Leigh:
Oh yes, of course. So, my son came home
tonight… different.
Frank Delmonico:
Different how?
Ava Leigh:

Well, um. . . I believe he was using
drugs. He came home not himself and
saying nonsense. I confronted him about
it, but he started freaking out and
fell down the stairs. (A beat) There
won’t be any legal ramifications
against him for me saying that, will
there?
Frank Delmonico:
I think the biggest concern right now
is your son. Is he alright?
Ava Leigh:
I don’t know! He’s not his usual self
so I don’t know if he’s injured, or
just high.
Frank Delmonico:
Can you take us to him?
Ava Leigh:
Why yes, of course.
20. INT. HALLWAY OF SMALL SUBURBAN HOME- NIGHT.
Ava Leigh opens the door and lets everyone in. Her son is pacing
back and forth in the hallway. He has a smash gash on his
forehead. He has jeans and a hoody on. Frank Delmonico slowly
approaches him.
Preceptor Phil:
What’s his name?
Ava Leigh:
Steven.
Frank Delmonico:
Hey Steven. My name is Frank Delmonico.
I’m with the fire department, and I’m
here to help. Can you tell me what’s
wrong?
Steven keeps pacing, not acknowledging Frank at all.

Steven:
He’s a liar. He’s a liar. Why would he
do this to me? We’re friends. Why would
he do this to me?
Frank Delmonico:
Steven. Steven, can you look at me.
Steven turns towards Frank, but that seems to freak him out.
Steven:
Stay back! Please don’t hurt me. I
swear I’ll never go near the ocean
again!
Frank turns back toward Ava.
Ava Leigh:
Before he fell he was going on and on
about talking mermaids that were out to
get him.
Frank Delmonico:
Steven, I am not hear to hurt you. I
just want to make sure you’re okay.
Steven:
No please!
Steven flails an arm out in Frank’s direction. He easily dodges
it. He then walks towards Phil, and has a private conversation
with him.
Frank Delmonico:
So what do we do Phil?
Preceptor Phil:
Are we even sure he’s injured?
Frank Delmonico:
I don’t know but we can’t leave without
checking him out. So what? Call for
Police restraint?

Preceptor Phil:
No, this kid is like a buck forty, and
intoxicated. I’m thinking we just go
cravat handcuff.
Frank Delmonico:
That might work.
Frank turns to Ava Leigh.
Frank Delmonico:
Ma’am, do we have permission to
restrain your son while we examine him.
It won’t hurt him.
Ava Leigh:
If it helps you treat him, yes.
Preceptor Phil opens a cravat up and ties a handcuff knot. Chloe
starts to walk forward.
Frank Delmonico:
Alright Chloe you’re going to stand
there in the corner and draw him out.
We’ll be behindSteven:
What! No get away from me you freaks.
Leave me alone!
Steven starts to charge forward before we hear a crack and him
fall to the ground in agony, clutching his shin. Frank and Phil
walk up to him to check him out. They lift up his jeans to
reveal a bone sticking out near his shin.
21. INT. FIRE STATION DINING ROOM- NIGHT.
Cut to Kevin sitting at the dining room table, doodling in his
notebook. Kevin looks up to the electronic clock, which reads
9:58. He sighs and then starts packing up his things. He starts
to head for the door when the alarm sounds.
Automated Intercom:
Ambulance 96. Medical. 1100 West
Montgomery Road. Initial Entry.

Kevin sees Miller and Thompson emerge from the bunk rooms and
walk briskly towards the garage. Miller stops and turns to
Kevin.
Miller:
It’s not 10 yet. You can come if you
want?
Kevin looks uncomfortable.
Kevin:
Oh, ah, thanks, but I- I have a long
day tomorrow. Better get going.
Miller:
Suit yourself. Well it was nice meeting
you Kevin Starr. Hopefully we meet
again.
Miller jogs to the ambulance. Kevin walks towards the front
door.
22. EXT. FIRE HOUSE PARKING LOT- NIGHT.
Kevin walks out and sees the ambulance, lights and sirens
flashing hot, drive past him. He walks towards his car.
23. INT. KEVIN’S CAR- NIGHT.
Kevin opens
frustrated.
face in his
forward and

his car door and throws his backpack in, clearly
He gets in. He looks forward and then buries his
steering wheel, honking the horn. He then looks
shakes his head.
Kevin:
God damn-it.

Kevin starts his car and drives off.
24. EXT. STATION 7 PARKING LOT- NIGHT.
Chloe is outside, sitting on the steps that lead from the
parking lot to the sidewalk. She sees Kevin pull in the lot. She
gets up, walks towards him, and gets in the car.
25. INT. KEVIN’S CAR- NIGHT.
Kevin:

Why were you waiting outside? It’s like
forty degrees outside.
Chloe:
Because my two preceptors were
misogynistic assholes, and if I was
around them for any more I would have
slit my wrists
Kevin:
Damn. That sucks. Did you go on a call
at least?
Chloe:
Yeah! We went to some house and the
patient was high on acid or something
like that. Anyway he fell down the
stairs and had a compound fracture of
his tibia. Or fibula. I don’t know
which.
Kevin:
That sounds pretty gross to be honest.

Chloe:
Oh no, it was, but this guy didn’t know
he broke anything since he was tripping
balls. He was pacing back and forth on
his leg and was rambling about killer
mermaids and shit like that.
Kevin:
Oh shit, really? That sounds like a fun
call. Was the drug wearing off as you
transported him?
Chloe:
I think so. I mean he was in unbearable
pain the entire time. (A pause) Now
what about you?

Kevin:
Nothing.
Chloe:
Really?
Kevin:
Yep. I just sat around for like three
hours. The alarm didn’t even ring once.
Chloe:
That sucks. Did you at least enjoy
sitting around?
Kevin:
Yeah. My preceptors were pretty
awesome.
Chloe:
Lucky.
Kevin:
You’re the one that went on a call.
Chloe:
One down, nine to go. Seems like a lot,
doesn’t it.
Kevin:
It does. We have until May though.
We’ll get ten one way or another.

26. INT. STARR HOME FAMILY ROOM- NIGHT.
You see Christmas decorations all around. Lots of red and green,
and a beautifully decorated tree, with a few presents
underneath. Kevin, and Kacie are watching a movie. You hear
someone knock on the door and open it.
Stella:

Hello, hello!
Kevin and Kacie say hi. Stella is carrying a CHRISTMAS BAG. She
sets it down and walks in the family room.
Stella (cont’d):
Where’s mom?
Kevin:
Grocery store. Or something like that.
Stella:
Watcha’ watching.
Kacie:
Dawn of the Dead.
Stella:
Such a great Christmas Eve movie. I
swear you guys have seen this thing a
thousand times.
Kevin:
It’s Christmas Eve tradition! And
Easter. And 4th of July, and Labor day
Kacie:
Don’t forget about Valentine’s Day.
Kevin:
Oh, good point. Always on Valentine’s
Day. It’s an underrated movie.
Kacie:
That it is. Hey Kevin if the three of
us were being chased by zombies would
you sacrifice yourself and do the noble
thing so we could live?
Kevin:
Fuck no. I have way too many bad
childhood memories in my head from you
two. If we were being chased by zombies
I’d consider it and then think “Shut up
Kevin, remember that time Kacie threw a

hot wheel at your face when you ate all
the Lucky charms?
Kevin (cont’d):
That shit hurt, she deserves to be
eaten alive.”
Stella:
Alright, but what if it was anyone but
us, say an innocent girl being chased
by zombies. Would you do the heroic
thing and sacrifice yourself so that
she would live?
Kevin:
Depends on how hot she is.(A pause)Now
are we going to talk about who’d die
for who all night or are you going to
let that fine looking bag, of what I
presume is presents, just sit there,
collecting dust?
Stella shakes her head and grabs for the bag. She hands both
Kacie and Kevin a gift.
Stella:
It’s the best that clearance at Five
Below had. My wonderful college
education forbids me to shop anywhere
with name brand products.
Kevin opens his gift. It’s a navy blue T-shirt. He holds it up
and it says “If it weren’t for stupid people, I wouldn’t have a
job” with the Star of Life emblem beneath that.
Kevin:
Oh. My. God. I may never take this off.
Stella opens hers. It’s also a T-Shirt. She picks it up. The
front says “I am a great teacher because. . . “ and the back
says “I hate children.”
Kacie:
The sad part is this is probably true
for most cases.
27. INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM- DAY.

Kevin is sitting in a classroom. He is doodling in his notebook.
His English teacher Mrs. Royston drops a test on Kevin’s
notebook. Kevin looks at it. At the top is circle 23/75. Kevin
looks up to see Mrs. Royston staring at him.
Mrs. Royston:
Remember Kevin, you need this class to
graduate and you aren’t doing so hot
this quarter.

Kevin:
Yes Mrs. Royston. I apologize and I’ll
do better.
Mrs. Royston walks away.
28. INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY. DAY.
Kevin finds Chloe in the hallway and walks up to her.
Kevin:
Hey.
Chloe:
Hey. What’s up?
Kevin:
I think I’m failing English. What a
joke, high school English is the
easiest thing on this planet.
Chloe:
Than why are you failing it?
Kevin:
Because I’ve been so busy studying for
EMT class that I’m slacking off in
other classes.
Chloe:
Yeah, I understand. My report card will
probably be straight C’s. It’s getting
tough.

Kevin:
Yeah it is, and we haven’t even gotten
to the meat of the class yet. I still
don’t have any calls. Fuck me, senior
year is supposed to be a cakewalk.
Chloe:
Remember at orientationKevin:
Yeah I don’t want to hear another thing
about orientation and how we were
warned about this.
Chloe:
You did say that orientations are
supposed to weed out the weak minded
ones.
Kevin:
So I’m weak minded now?
Chloe:
That’s not what I’m saying, but I do
recall you telling me not to worry
about what Mr. Broman said. Your
ignorance there may be…
Kevin:
Weak minded?
Chloe:
Eh, maybe just a little. We’re in too
deep now though. Eye on the prize.
Kevin:
Yeah, yeah. So am I driving you to your
ride-along tomorrow?
Chloe:

Yes you are. A good ten hours tomorrow.
Hopefully we get at least get 2 calls
each.
Kevin:
Yeah. Hopefully.
29. EXT. KEVIN’S CAR- DAY.
You see Kevin sitting in his car with sweat on his forehead. He
is tapping the steering wheel with his finger. Switch to POV of
Kevin. He looks out his car windshield at the fire station.
Kevin:
And here we go.
He takes a deep breath, grabs his backpack and exits the car.
30. INT. FIRE HOUSE KITCHEN- DAY.
Kevin is led to the firehouse kitchen, once more, and sees
Thompson and Miller seated at the table watching The Price is
Right.
Miller:
She spun it too hard.
Thompson:
No, she did it perfectly.
You see the wheel stop a 100.
Miller:
You Irish sorcerer.
Miller slams a 10 on the table. She glances at Kevin.
Miller:
Hey! Look who it is. . .
Miller stares at Kevin, clear she forgot his name.
Kevin:
Kevin.
Miller:

That’s right, Kevin. Looks like we
haven’t drove you away yet. Don’t
worry, not many people can last more
than two, three ride-alongs tops with
us. Bad things always happen.
Thompson puts his hand next to his lips, making a shield between
Miller and himself. He loudly whispers:
Thompson:
She’s punched a ride-along before.
Right in the face. Broke her nose too.
Miller:
Hey, it is an unwritten rule that if
you take someone’s Scooby Doo fruit
snacks without asking than you reserve
the right to be punched in the face. I
don’t care if you’ve been here twelve
hours and forgot to bring a snack.
Miller smiles a creepy smile and looks at Kevin.
Miller (cont’d):
So how long are you hear until Kevin?
Kevin:
Uh, until 8 tonight. Has it been a
quiet day?
Miller and Thompson look at Kevin, as if he has just risen from
the dead.
Miller:
Oh no…
Thompson:
Why. Why would you do that?
Kevin:
Did I do something wrong?
Miller:
You never, ever ask if it has been a
quiet day. You look like a baseball
fan. If the pitcher is pitching a

perfect game you do not, under any
circumstance, mention that he is
pitching a perfect game. You’ll jinx it
if you even think it. Same thing here.
We’ve been having an unusually quiet
day, but now we’re going to be
bombarded with call after call. I hope
you’re ready.
Thompson:
Let me get a snack now.
Before Thompson could walk over to the pantry the alarm sounds.
You see Thompson’s head sink, and can here Miller groan
Automated Intercom:
Ambulance 96. Medical. 7945 East
Chester Court. Initial Entry.
Miller turns to Kevin.
Miller:
Why, Kevin, why…
She walks towards the garage. Thompson follows, glaring at Kevin
as he passes.
Thompson:
Chop, chop. We gotta bolt.
Kevin looks down to see his hand shaking. He takes a deep breath
and follows.
31. INT. AMBULANCE 96- Day.
Kevin is seated in the back compartment of the ambulance,
looking down on the stretcher. Thompson is driving, and Miller
is in the passenger seat, looking at a laptop bolted to the
dashboard. You can see a map on the screen with a flashing
target on it.
Miller:
Alright we’re going to the apartment
buildings up on West Chester.
Thompson:
We’re is that?
Miller:

Take 100 east and then we get off at
exit 22. We follow that road for about
2 miles and make a left.

Thompson:
That’s right next to that Target,
right? Alright I know where we’re
going.
They pull out of the lot, sirens flashing hot. It is very loud,
and bumpy in the back. Kevin leans to the left and turns his
head around so he can see out of the front windshield. Thompson
honks his horn several times before they approach a red light,
and then he runs it.
Miller:
You alright back there?
Kevin:
Yeah. It’s just my first call so there
are a little butterflies.
Miller:
That’s right, you didn’t get a call
when you were here with us last. (To
Thompson) Do you remember your first
call?
Thompson:
Ha. Mine was an old, fat drunk that
fell down the stairs. We could barely
lift him on the ambo, and he puked
halfway through the ride.
Miller:
How very Irish. (To Kevin) You’ll be
fine. Chances are it’s nothing. We
rarely run anything too exciting. My
first call was a lady that thought she
broke her arm, so she thought calling
911 would get her seen quicker. As soon
as we got to the hospital we wheeled
her straight to the waiting room. The

look on her face was priceless when we
asked her to get off the stretcher and
take a seat.
A radio between the two seats started making static.
Dispatch radio:
Ambulance 96, do you copy? I repeat,
ambulance 96, do you copy?
Miller picks up the walky.
Miller:
Yes, ambulance 96 here.

Dispatch radio:
Right, so we got a call about a woman
in labor at your destination. Engines
92, and 22 will be right behind you,
along with Medic 56. Over.
Miller sets the walky down.
Thompson:
A childbirth? I don’t want to do a damn
child birth.
Miller:
(To Kevin) You’re in luck. We got a. .
. unique call.
The ambulance enters the parking lot of a 5 story apartment
complex.
32. EXT. APARTMENT COMPLEX PARKING LOT- DAY.
Miller and Thompson get out the front. Kevin unbuckles and grabs
gloves from a box hanging from the door. Miller opens the back
hatch of the ambulance and grabs the stretcher handle. On top of
the stretcher is a big RED BAG. Miller unhooks the stretcher
from the ambulance, pulls, and then lowers the stretcher to the
ground. Thompson is gaining access to the building.
33. INT. Apartment complex lobby. Day.
Thompson enters the building first and sees a few people
crowding the elevator in the lobby. He briskly walks over, Kevin

and Miller trailing closely behind. A man, mid 20s, handsome and
well-built, RUNS to Thompson. You see panic on his face and
dried tears on his cheek
Mr. Prestman:
Come! Quickly! My wife is about give
birth. Please you have to do something!
Mr. Prestman runs towards the elevator.
34. INT. ELEVATOR- DAY.
It is wide-open, emergency alarm sounding. On the floor of the
elevator is KATE PRESTMAN, in a nightgown and panicked. A random
female tenant is also in the elevator comforting her.
Mr. Prestman:
Her name is Kate Prestman
Thompson:
Kate, can you hear me?
Kate looks up and nods her head. The random female tenant gets
up and leaves.
Thompson:
Can you tell me what happened?
Miller starts taking vital signs on Kate. Kevin watches from the
door of the elevator, alongside Mr. Prestman. Both look white as
a ghost.
Kate:
I woke up very early this morning andum, I had to go to the bathroom badly.
Nothing out of the ordinary, but once I
was on the toilet I couldn’t go, even
though it felt like I had to. I get a
lot of UTIs, so I thought it might be
one of those. So I thought nothing of
it and went back to bed. Then I woke up
several hours later with my sheets
soaked and in pain. I told Phil to get
everything ready. I got out of bed and
had a contraction. Phil helped me to
the door, but I had another contraction
in the elevator, only about two minutes
later, and it hurt a lot. Phil then

called you guys… I think the baby is
coming.
SWITCH TO: POV Kevin.
Thompson checks underneath the nightgown.
Thompson:
Oh yes he is. Head is already starting
to crown.
Miller places a folded towel under Kate’s butt. She turns to
Kevin.
Miller:
Can you set up a nasal cannula?
END POV Kevin. Kevin looks startled. He takes a second to
compose himself and walks out of the elevator to the red bag on
top of the stretcher.
35. INT. APARTMENT LOBBY- DAY.
There are several more fire engines and ambulances outside and
people are starting to walk in. He opens the red bag, digs
through it, and grabs the oxygen cylinder and nasal cannula. He
sets it up and walks back into the room.
36. INT. ELEVATOR- DAY.
Kevin very slowly walks towards the action. He offers the set up
N.C. to Miller. She just stares at it and then back at Kevin.
Kevin retracts his offer and then kneels down to Kate.
Kevin:
(Voice crack) Alright Mrs. Prestman.
I’m going to place this oxygen mask on
you. It will smell funny at first but
then you’ll feel better.
Kate:
(Panting) Okay.
Kevin tries to place N.C. on Kate but struggles. His hand is
shaking and he can’t seem to get it around her ears. Miller
quickly snaps it from Kevin and puts it on quickly and
perfectly.
Thompson:

Alright Kate. Are you ready to be a
mother?
Kate:
Oh god yes!
Thompson:
Alright on three I want you to push as
hard as you can. 1..2..3!
Kate pushes and lets out a scream of pain. Her face goes red.
Kevin grabs Kate’s hand.
Thompson (cont’d):
Alright again! 1..2..3!
Kate pushes again, screams again, and squeezes Kevin’s hand
hard.
Thompson (cont’d):
One last time. Give it your all.
Alright, 1..2..3!
Kate pushes once more, screams much louder, and squeezes Kevin’s
hand white. You see Thompson pull a baby boy out. Miller cuts
the umbilical cord. Thompson goes to his feet, baby in hand. It
has not cried yet. Miller suctions the baby’s nose, eyes, and
mouth. Still no cry. Miller and Thompson walk out of the
elevator. Mr. Prestman walks in to be with his wife. Kate turns
to Kevin.
Kate:
What’s happening? Why hasn’t my baby
cried?
Kate starts to tear up.
Kevin:
Uh… They are working on your… baby.
Kate:
What does that mean? Is he going to be
alright?
37. INT. APARTMENT LOBBY. DAY.
The baby on the stretcher. Miller is wiping it down with a
towel. Thompson has a stethoscope to its chest.

Thompson:
Faint heartbeat. Very shallow breaths.
Pulse ox is only 87. We don’t have
oxygen masks that fit him. (A beat)
What we need is a blow by mask.
Miller takes a second to think than says this:
Miller:
We can simulate one.
She reaches in the red bag and brings out a children’s NONREBREATHER MASK. She quickly hooks it up and turns it on. She
holds the mask about six inches from the babies face so the
oxygen blows on its face.
Thompson:
That’s brilliant. Pulse ox is rising.
90. 91.
Miller:
Come on cry.
After a few seconds the baby starts to cry.
Thompson:
Well done.
38. INT. ELEVATOR- DAY.
You can hear the baby cry. Kate goes from distraught to elated
in a split second.
Kate:
Oh thank god!
Mr. Prestman and Kate embrace each other, relieved.
39. INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM- Day
We cut to the hospital. From a distance you see Miller laugh and
wave goodbye from the doorway of a hospital room. She walks over
to Kevin and Thompson, who is typing something up on a LAPTOP
from the ambulance.
Miller:

I think that’s my first childbirth.
Kevin:
Mine too.
Thompson laughs.
Thompson:
The three of us can cross it off our
EMT bucket lists.

Miller:
I never want to do another one again.
That probably took years off my life.
She turns to Kevin.
Miller:
How do you feel?
Kevin:
Uh, pretty good.
Thompson:
Do you smell something Miller?
Miller:
Yeah, it smells awfully like bullshit.
Kevin:
I’ve had much better days. That’s as
stressful as it gets, right?
Thompson:
Stressful? Yes, but once on a blue moon
you’ll get a call that shakes you to
the core. (A beat) Trust me on that.
Alright, I’m done. Let’s get going.
40. INT. THE PARK- DAY.
Chloe, Frank Delmonico, and Preceptor Phil are in the park
treating a preteen kid who tripped and hit his head. He has a
gash on the side of his head and is groaning and mumbling. Frank
puts a GAUZE PAD over the gash and Preceptor Phil is wrapping

ROLLER GAUZE around his head, tightly securing the gauze pad as
well.
Chloe:
Do we send one of the kids to get his
mom?
Frank Delmonico looks at Preceptor Phil and shakes his head
smiling.
Frank Delmonico:
What, so you think it would be smart to
send one of these kids to his front
door and tell his mother that her son
is injured and is being taken to the
hospital? Come on, use your head
sweety. That would be beyond moronic.
Chloe stand there, with a defeated look on her face. You hear
thunder.

Frank Delmonico:
Looks like it’s going to rain. Let’s
get him on the ambo quickly. I don’t
want to get soaked.
41. INT. AMBULANCE 96- DAY.
You see the ambulance pull into the fire station parking lot.
The garage door opens. Miller is driving and starts to back into
the station.
Thompson:
God, it’s only 3 (Sigh). We still have
three hours until dinner.
Miller:
It is Pizza Friday!
Thompson:
Fuck yeah! But do we have any of that
chicken left-over from last shift in
the fridge?
Miller:

I think so.
Miller stops, turns the engine off, and everyone exits.
42. INT. FIRE STATION 9- DAY.
Thompson:
Good. I don’t think I’ve eaten lunch.
(Notions to Kevin) Sir Jinx-a lot here
made sure of it.
They walk through the door that connects the garage to the main
area. They head straight for the kitchen. Miller and Kevin sit
at the dining room table. Miller switches on the TV. Thompson
heads over to the fridge
Miller:
What time is the fight tonight?
Thompson:
7 I think. Who ya got, Juntez, or
Estrada?
He puts a PLATE in the MICROWAVE.
Miller:
Estrada all day. Did you see his last
fight? He nearly killed McLean.
Thompson:
Please he’s all hype. You like UFC
fighting Kevin?
Kevin:
Can’t say that I do.
Thompson:
Ah, don’t worry, that will change soon
enough. I didn’t either when I came to
the States, but Miller practically
brainwashed me.
Thompson sits down with his plate. It is steaming and looks
rather appetizing. He is about to put a forkful in his mouth
when the alarm sounds. Thompson’s head drops and under his
breath he whipers:

Thompson:
Oh fuck me.
Automated alarm:
Medical. 4926 Rendview Lane. Initial
Entry.
Miller gets up, followed by a very reluctant Thompson. Kevin
follows. The food sits at the table, still steaming.
43. INT. AMBULANCE 76- DAY.
Preceptor Phil is driving. Frank Delmonico and Chloe are in the
back with the boy. Chloe is placing a blood pressure cuff on the
boy. He murmurs.
Chloe:
What?
The boy turns his head slowly towards Chloe and faintly
whispers:
Boy:
Dia..betic.
Chloe:
What?
Frank Delmonico:
Quiet. I’m trying to start my report.
Chloe:
I’m not 100%, but I think he said
diabetic.
Frank Delmonico:
He has a head injury. All he’s
muttering is nonsense.
Chloe:
But what if he isn’t. What if actually
is diabetic and is hypoglycemic right
now. It couldn’t hurt to check, could
it?
Frank Delmonico:

Look, it’s not happening. He’s not
diabetic, so shut your mouth and sit
down.
Chloe very reluctantly sits down. She gives Frank a very dirty
look.
44. INT. AMBULANCE 96. DAY.
The ambulance pulls into a high class neighborhood. They see a
girl, maybe 14, with some blood on her shirt, at the end of a
driveway, jumping up and down and pointing towards the house.
Miller:
Well this can’t be good.
Miller pulls into the driveway, and heads towards the house. You
can see that there has been some construction work going on- a
LADDER, a MOUND OF DIRT, and some new LUMBER- outside. The
ambulance stops. Kevin gets his gloves on quickly. He heads out
the side door. He takes a deep breath.
45. EXT. FRONT YARD OF SINGLE FAMILY HOME. DAY.
Kevin swings around to the back door. He opens it and unclips
the stretcher from the wall. Miller comes over and helps him get
it on the ground. The three of them head towards the front door.
Thompson rings the doorbell. Almost immediately a young boy,
maybe 12, opens the door with a panicked look on his face and
blood on his shirt and hands.
Young Boy:
Hurry, hurry.
46. INT. SINGLE FAMILY HOME- DAY.
Thompson, Miller, and Kevin walk in the doorway and stop in
their tracks, horror on their faces.
Thompson:
Mother of God.
Turn to the scene. It looks like the aftermath of a slasher
movie. There was a pool of blood in the middle of the hallway
and footprints of blood leading away from it. A man, 40s, was in
the center of the pool, unconscious. There was lots of broken
glass on the floor and a ladder nearby. A woman, 40s, was

holding a bath towel, soaked in blood, to the man’s side. You
could see horror on Miller, Thompson, and Kevin.
Miller:
What happened?
Miller is taking vitals while Thompson holds pressure with the
towel. The man is pale as a ghost.
Woman in shock:
He was just being helpful. We’ve been
planning to renovate for a while now.
We were thinking of getting it
professionally done. Ralph wouldn’t
have any of that. He really is
stubborn. He’s done a good job with
everything, too. And then today was no
different. And then I heard the
shatter.
The woman just sat a few feet from the man, staring at the wall,
with an almost calm aura to her.
Miller:
Pulse 128. Systolic BP only 70. He’s
definitely in hypovolemic shock. What
do you need?
Thompson removes the towel, only for blood to spurt out.
Thompson:
Oh wow. That’s definitely an artery.
Uhh, give me multi-trauma dressings.
Lots of them.
She hands Thompson the multi-trauma dressings, and then sets up
an oxygen mask. Kevin is still standing in the corner, in shock
almost, face almost as pale as the man’s and frozen in fear.
Thompson:
Blood is soaking through. We need an
ice pack. (Without looking up)Kevin can
you run to the rig and grab an icepack.
Miller looks up at Kevin.
Miller:

Shit. Kevin, look at me.
Kevin looks at Miller.
Miller (cont’d)
This man needs your help, as I’m sure
you can see. I need you to focus now.
You need to run out to the ambulance
and grab an icepack?
Thompson:
And also get a full backboard. Do you
know where those things are?
Kevin nods slowly, face still white.
Miller:
Go! Now!
47. EXT. FRONT YARD OF SINGLE FAMILY HOME- DAY.
Kevin books it out the door so fast that he almost falls. He
runs to the ambulance and throws both of the dual back doors
open.
48. INT. AMBULANCE 96- DAY.
Kevin jumps up, looks to his left at the cabinets built into the
wall, and then opens one and grabs an INSTANT ICEPACK. His hands
are shaking. He then walks towards the back of the ambulance,
opens a very tall and lean cabinet, and pulls out a FULL
BACKBOARD. The backboard is 72’’ by 16’’. Kevin puts the
backboard under his armpit and squeezes it against his body.
49. EXT. FRONT YARD OF SINGLE FAMILY HOME- DAY.
He then jumps out of the ambulance and runs just as fast back
into the house as he did out of it.
50. INT. SINGLE FAMILY HOME- DAY.
He places the backboard on the stretcher and walks up to Miller,
trying not to look down at the blood, and hands Miller the icepack. She crushes it up in her hand and places it in Kevin’s
hand.
Miller:
You hold this on top of the dressings
and apply pressure. Got it?

Kevin nods, but just to make sure she forces his hand on top of
Thompson’s. Thompson removes his hand, and Kevin takes sole
control over holding pressure to the wound. With just an ice
pack and several multi-trauma dressings between his hand and the
man’s chest.
Thompson:
Alright Kevin, I want you to hold
pressure on that wound until we get to
the hospital. I don’t want for even a
second you relaxing your muscles. Do
you understand?
Kevin nods, eyes staring at his hands.
Thompson:
(To Miller) Alright we gotta load’n’go
now!
Miller grabs the backboard and lowers it to the ground, parallel
to the man. Thompson and Miller kneel on opposite ends of Kevin.
Thompson closer to the head, Miller closer to the feet.
Thompson:
Alright Kevin, we are going to roll the
patient on the count of three. You just
keep holding pressure. One-two-three.
They roll the patient, Miller quickly pulls the backboard under
the man with one hand, and then they roll the man onto the
board. They quickly get up and Miller wheels the stretcher
towards them. After that Miller goes to the feet, and Thompson
to the head.
Thompson:
Alright Kevin, we’re lifting onto the
stretcher on three. Keep holding! Onetwo-three.
Miller and Thompson lift the backboard and shuffle over to the
stretcher. Once the backboard is over the stretcher they lower
slowly. Kevin keeps holding pressure. Thompson quickly pushes
the stretcher forward, with Miller guiding at the feet.
51. EXT. FRONT YARD OF SINGLE FAMILY HOME- DAY.
Miller and Thompson are moving almost too fast for Kevin to keep
up with, let alone hold good pressure. They swing around to the

back of the ambulance, doors still open, and clip him in the
safety lock, and lift him onto the ambulance. Miller stays back
with Kevin while Thompson goes to drive.
Miller:
You’re going to have to hunch over the
man the entire ride there. You ready to
become an expert in standing on an
ambulance while it’s going in hot? Just
don’t fall, or we all lose.
Miller is hooking up the man to the blood pressure cuff and
placing the pulse oximeter on a finger. Thompson turns the
sirens on and takes off. It seems like he is going twice as fast
on the way out as he was on the way there. Kevin almost falls
when Thompson hits a bump in the road.
Miller (cont’d)
Shit. His BP is 66 but his pulse is
dipping too. It’s 76 now. Pulse Ox is
only 89.
Thompson:
How are his pupils?
Miller:
Blown.
Thompson:
God damn-it. (To no one in particular)
Oh come on traffic, be cool today. I
don’t want to get in another fucking
accident on the way to the hospital.
Kevin:
This doesn’t have a happy ending, does
it?
Miller:
Life almost never does.
52. INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM- DAY.
Frank Delmonico, Preceptor Phil, and Chloe are all in the ER
hallways with the patient. Nurse Williams, 50s, is asking them
questions.

Nurse Williams:
Last BP?
Frank Delmonico:
122/65.
Nurse Williams:
Any medical alert bracelets?
Frank Delmonico:
Negative.
Chloe is looking at them, arms crossed.
Nurse Williams:
We’ll have to work on identifying him.
Usually the parents show up frantic in
the ER, so let’s hope for that. Alright
anything else I should know before I
get you a room?
Frank Delmonico:
Nothing. Just the head injury.
Chloe shakes her head. She turns and looks at the boy’s face. He
is no longer moaning, but sees his teeth chattering. She turns
back around and walks forward.
Chloe:
No actually there is something.
Frank Delmonico:
Quiet girl.
Nurse Williams:
Hush now Frank. You let that girl
speak. What is it child?
Chloe:
On the ambulance ride over the patient
whispered to me the word Diabetic. I
think he could be diabetic.
Nurse Williams looks to Frank.
Nurse Williams:
You didn’t take his blood sugar?

Frank says nothing. Nurse Roberts gets up, walks over to a
nurse’s cart, grabs a glucometer, and goes to the patient. She
takes his blood sugar, with Chloe hovering. The meter reads 27.
Nurse Williams:
Oh my lord.
Nurse Williams turns and shouts:
Nurse Williams:
Can I get some help over here!
She turns to Frank Delmonico.
Nurse Williams:
Shame on you.
A few people run over and help Nurse Williams bring the boy into
a room. You see Chloe watch them go, and Frank slowly walk up
behind her. Chloe can hear him breathe loudly, so she turns
around.
Frank Delmonico:
Can I talk to you for a second sweat
heart?
Chloe:
I don’t thinkFrank Delmonico:
It won’t take long.
Frank grabs Chloe’s arm and walks down a pretty empty hallway.
Frank Delmonico:
What did I say? WHAT DID I FUCKING SAY?
You say nothing, unless you are asked
by me. Now you’ve made all of us look
incompetent. This is not your friend’s
sleepover. You don’t get to do whatever
the fuck you want. You have to listen
to me. I can easily write an email to
your instructor, telling him what an
insubordinate bitch you are.
Frank starts to walk away.

Chloe:
So it’s my fault that you don’t know
how to do your God damn job?
Frank takes a second to register what just said, turns around,
and walks up to Chloe. She backs up against the wall. Frank
brings his head to her ear and whispers:

Frank Delmonico:
Don’t get cute sweaty. I can end your
chances of ever getting hired by the
county. I’m heavily involved with the
application process. Chloe McDaid. I’ll
make it my duty to scan every single
application we ever get for the next
ten years, just so I get the ten second
satisfaction of putting yours through
the shredder. Oh, how I miss the old
days. When this was a man’s job. You
could say what you want, and do what
you want without some bitch disrupting
the order of things.
Nurse Williams comes up and pulls Frank away from Chloe.
Nurse Williams:
What is WRONG with you? Do you get
aroused if you crush the spirit of a
high school girl? You need help. Now
get the fuck away from her or I’ll call
down security.
Frank walks away and Nurse Roberts turns to Chloe.
Nurse Williams (cont’d):
Are you alright child?
Chloe:
Yeah, yeah, I’m fine.
53. INT. EMERGENCY ROOM NURSES STATION- DAY.

Cut to about five minutes later. Chloe is writing something
down. She puts her pencil down and watches Frank Delmonico and
Preceptor Phil walk out the ER doors.
Nurse Williams (O.S.):
You sure you have someone that can come
pick you up?
Chloe turns to face Nurse Williams:
Chloe:
I have someone. I’ll call them after I
finish my mock report.
Nurse Williams:
So how do you like the program so far?
Chloe:
It’s good, it’s real good.

Chloe (cont’d):
We’re learning so much that’s it’s hard
to keep up with the book work, and then
throw the field ride-alongs in, and
it’s…it’s a grind. It’s been well worth
it though!
Nurse Williams:
That’s good. You’re next preceptors
will be much better than those two.
They’re the exception.
Chloe:
That’s good. I still need six more
calls. Hopefully I get some exciting
ones to close.
Nurse Williams:
You mean serious. You’re too young and
inexperienced to be calling peoples
pain and suffering exciting.
Chloe:

Well when you put it like that. (A
beat) Have you gotten anything good in
the pit today?
Nurse Williams:
Yeah, actually, this morning we had a
child birth in the field and some EMTs
brought mother, and baby in, both
healthy!
Chloe puts her pencil down, looks up, and stares at Nurse
Williams.
Chloe:
Shut-up! Seriously?
Nurse Williams nods.
Chloe (cont’d):
That’s so freaking cool. Oh man, I
wished I was on that call.
Nurse Williams:
Yeah, they came in about an hour and a
half ago. Three EMTs, one of them
looked about your age. He was cute so
you should definitely find out who he
is.
Chloe:
Yeah, right. Here I am the taxi service
for the ‘next stop heaven’ group, and
some lucky EMTs get a childbirth.
Chloe (cont’d):
Every minute I’m here there’s probably
some badass call going on out there.
Nurse Williams:
Next stop heaven?
The ER’s RADIO switches on, and interrupts Nurse Williams.
Thompson via Radio:
Ellicott City General Hospital, this is
ambulance 96, do you copy?

Nurse Williams walks over to the radio, and picks up the walkytalky.
Nurse Williams:
Ambulance 96, this is Ellicott City
General Hospital.
Thompson via Radio:
We have a priority 1 patient, heavy
blood loss, unconscious, in shock, and
weak pulse and BP. We’re coming in hot.
ETA about two minutes.
Nurse Williams:
Alright, I copy, over. (Shouting)
Alright we got a priority 1, severe
hemorrhage coming in. Call down the doc
and clear a room.
You see a few people in the background shuffling. Nurse Williams
turns to Chloe.
Nurse Williams (cont’d):
That was the guy from earlier that
brought the childbirth in. Very Irish.
Maybe you’ll also get to meet the
younger guy that’s with them.
Chloe:
Some units get all the luck.
Nurse Williams:
You and I have very different
definitions of the word luck. Anyways,
based on the guy’s description, it
doesn’t sound too good. Massive blood
loss, shock, and weak vitals? Call the
ER doc, and then call the morgue.
Chloe:
I thought we weren’t supposed to be so
grim?
Nurse Williams:

Oh sweetie. I said you aren’t. I’m a 20
year ER nurse, I can call them as I see
‘em.
You can faintly hear sirens now.
Nurse Williams:
I’ll let you get back to your report
now. I’ve got something exciting!
Nurse Williams slips on GLOVES and walks towards the crowd that
is accumulating by the ER doors. A RANDOM EMT walks up to Chloe.
Random EMT:
Well, it looks like Brody Thompson has
had a busy day today.
Chloe:
Who?
Random EMT:
Are you a ride-along?
Chloe nods.
Random EMT:
He’s on unit 96, along with Jessica
Miller I believe. He’s had a childbirth
and now is coming in hot with a massive
hemorrhage. That’s a hall of fame
horrifying day.
Chloe:
Horrifying? I thought it would be
badass.
Random EMT:
It’s not. You go to a childbirth,
right, which has so much pressure for
you to do everything perfect, to a
massive hemorrhage, which is outright
terrifying because things can go from
bad to dead (snapping fingers) just
like that. Plus nobody likes blood all
over them. It messes with their psyche.
I hear they have a ride-along too.

Worst day to ride-along. That kid’s
career is over before it starts.
Chloe hears a lot of commotion down by the ER doors. She looks
up to see Kevin, standing on the basket that is connected
underneath the stretcher- like on a shopping cart- covered in
blood, holding a mound of bloody dressings to the side of a man
as pale as a ghost.
Miller and Thompson are guiding the stretcher to a room that a
nurse is directing them to. The crowd of people follow behind.
Chloe:
Why?
Random EMT is also looking at all the action and didn’t appear
to hear Chloe. Chloe turns to Random EMT and snaps:
Chloe (cont’d):
Why is it over?
Random EMT:
(A beat) Because that kid’s too far
gone. He’s seen the two highest
extremes. He’s brought a life into the
world, and has seen a life all but slip
away in front of his eyes. He’d need to
be ironman to shake that kind of
psychological anxiety off. Hopefully
he’s had some padding calls to get his
feet wet and mind prepared. He might
have a chance if that’s the case, but
if those are his first two calls than
God help him, because every time the
alarm rings he’ll be flashed with fear
that this call is just as serious as
the last. Even the most experienced
EMTs will be haunted by a day like
that.
Chloe:
You don’t know Kevin. That’s not him.
Random EMT:
I take it you do know him then. All the
advice I can give is to give him

support, and to distract him from
today. And to remind him it’s not
always this bad.
Chloe sees Kevin walk right past the nurse station, without ever
looking up. He goes towards the ER doors he came in from and
sits on a BENCH near the door. Chloe looks at Frank. Frank looks
at Chloe and then at Kevin. He nudges his head forward, as if to
indicate to Chloe to go over to him. Chloe does.
Chloe:
Hey!
Kevin looks up. Chloe see’s something flicker in his eyes.
Kevin:
Hey! What are you doing here?

Chloe:
We both have shifts today. Remember you
drove me? And I think I’m gonna hitch a
ride back to your station.
Kevin:
Why?
Chloe:
I’ll tell you later. Anyway I heard
about your two calls. Very cool if you
ask me.
Kevin:
Yeah, I guess they are. Bringing a baby
into this world is pretty cool.
Chloe:
Yeah, it totally is! You hear stories
of EMTs that deal with death, but you
never hear stories of those that bring
life into the world! You’re just giving
a giant middle finger to death.
Chloe laughs. Kevin blows air out his nose.
Kevin:

He may get the last laugh though.
Kevin looks over to the room the man is in. People are
frantically moving in and out. It doesn’t look good.
Kevin (cont’d):
This doesn’t have a happy ending.
Chloe:
You want to talk about it?
Suddenly we here a flat line sound and someone say “we’re losing
him”. Chloe turns to see it is Kevin’s patient’s room that it’s
coming from. Chloe sees Kevin walk past her and towards the
patient’s room. He stands in the doorway, watching. He sees the
man hooked up to a bunch of machines, a lot of doctors and
nurses working on him. Nurse Williams is holding pressure on the
wound now.
Young Doctor:
Clear!
Everyone steps back from the patient, including Nurse Williams,
while the doctor defibrillates the man. The doctor looks at the
heart monitor. Nothing.
Young Doctor:
Alright I’m calling it. Time of death
16:09.
A bunch of nurses walk past Kevin, removing their gloves. Kevin
looks to his left to see Thompson, standing there with him.
Thompson:
He needed an operating room an hour
ago. There was nothing any of us could
have done.
Thompson walks up to the patient. He grabs one of the man’s
hands with both of his, and brings his head down to his hands.
Thompson:
Until next time, my friend.
Thompson then releases the man’s hand and walks out of the room,
without even a glance at Kevin. Kevin walks into the room, and
up to the man. He looks at the man’s face for a few seconds.
Chloe walks up behind Kevin.

Chloe:
You want to talk about it?
Kevin:
You know, this is the first time I’ve
seen the man’s face. I’ve been holding
gauze to his side for close to an hour,
but never looked at his face. . . Or
even learned his name.
Chloe opens her mouth to speak, but before she does Kevin turns
around, and walks right past Chloe. Chloe closes both her eyes,
sighs, and drops her head.
54. INT. AMBULANCE 96- DUSK.
Thompson, Miller, Chloe and Kevin are all in the ambulance.
Thompson driving, Chloe riding shotgun. Kevin in his normal
seat, and Miller laying down on the bench in the back of the
ambulance, a jacket over her face. Thompson has the music on up
front, but it’s barely audible from the back. Kevin is staring
out the back window of the ambulance, no expression on his face.
There is dried blood still on his uniform.
55. INT. FIRE STATION 9- NIGHT.
You see Thompson, Miller, Chloe and Kevin walk through the
leading from the garage to the main section. They all walk
the kitchen to find it empty, with half a pizza waiting on
kitchen table. You can hear some conversation echoing down
hall.
Miller:
I’m not hungry.
Miller walks towards a door labeled “Bunks”, and goes in.
Chloe:
Me neither.
Thompson:
Pffh, if there is ever a day so bad
that I don’t want pizza at the end of
it than I better be dead. You hungry?
Kevin:
No.

Kevin walks away.
Thompson:
More for me.
56. EXT. KEVIN’S CAR- NIGHT.
Kevin and Chloe are in his car. It is pouring down rain outside.
Chloe:
We should talk.
Kevin:
I agree.
A prolonged silence.
Chloe:
Uhh, yes Kevin?
Kevin:
Oh I was waiting on you. Alright, no
matter. So are you at that point where
the hospital no longer smells like a
hospital? I walk in it and nothing, no
alcohol, no cleanser, no latex. It’s
weird. To be expected I guess.
Chloe:
You know what I meant.
Kevin:
Well I’m not a fucking mind reader. How
am I supposed to know the exact topic
that you wish to discuss?
Chloe:
Quit dodging! Let’s talk about your two
calls today.
Kevin:
Well what’s there to talk about? I
helped deliver a baby, and then
couldn’t save a man that fell on a
chandelier.
Chloe:

Stop being so cavalier.
Kevin raises his voice:
Kevin:
Alright, you want to know the honest to
God truth?
Chloe:
I think that would be pretty fucking
good.
Kevin suddenly turns into a parking lot, hardly slowing down. He
then slams on his breaks and gets out of the car. It is pouring
down rain. Chloe follows suit. Kevin screams at the top of his
lungs:
Kevin:
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
Chloe just watches.
Kevin:
There, I let it out. Happy!?
Chloe says nothing.
Kevin (cont’d):
I mean, what the fuck. Look at me. I’m
covered in blood. And I probably have
amniotic fluid in my hair. On TV they
dramatize what an EMT actually does,
because let’s face it, if they truly
tried to depict an average day of an
EMT of TV, it would be the most boring
thing on Earth. Or so we’ve been told.
Jesus Christ, there was a pool of blood
on that man’s floor bigger than any
pool I’ve ever seen in a slasher movie.
I see it every time I close my eyes. So
I don’t want you to try and show me the
light and calm me down at every fucking
turn because NONE OF THIS IS FUCKING
OKAY!
Chloe:

Don’t you DARE yell at me. Sure, your
day was pretty fucking awful, but today
I’ve been called sweetheart, sweety,
and bitch more times I can count. It’s
disgusting, but before you can tell me
I’m just being paranoid, and I should
get thicker skin, let inform you that
my preceptor, the person that is
supposed to mentor me, painted a very
clear picture about how he’ll never let
me get hired by the county, ever, just
because I was smarter than he was. So
we both have problems. Let’s join the
fucking club.
Chloe walks in front of the car and sits down. Kevin watches
her. He sincerely says:
Kevin:
I’m sorry.
Chloe:
Do you want to know a secret? I almost
quit the program after that man died in
the park. I stayed home from school,
drowning in self-pity, and just
thought. Thought about what I really
wanted, what this program really means
to me, and what I was going to say to
Mr. Broman, and to you especially. I’ve
had nightmares about that day. I don’t
know why I stayed to be honest. This,
right now, is about as far from what I
want as it gets. So, tell me Kevin, why
the fuck am I still doing it?
Kevin:
Because we’re stubborn. Because we
don’t quit. Because we want this extra
something in our lives. Pick your
favorite.
Kevin sits down next to Chloe.
Kevin (cont’d):

I don’t know what I want either. I’ve
thought I wanted this for a while now.
ButChloe:
Nobody wants this.
Chloe leans her shoulder on Kevin.
57. NIGHTMARE SEQUENCE.
You see Kevin in the front yard of the now dead man’s house. It
is the middle of the night, and very creepy. The front door is
wide open. He walks to the door.
Inside Kevin sees nothing out of the ordinary. Nothing that he
saw earlier today. He takes a couple steps inside and looks up.
The chandelier is installed, and hanging perfectly.
Kevin turns around towards the door and sees flashing lights,
but hears no siren. He walks towards a window, and looks out. He
doesn’t see anything, but when he looks at the open door he can
see flashing lights reflected on it.
Kevin walks towards the door, looks outside and see’s nothing.
All of a sudden he hears an unbelievably loud shatter.
He swings his body around and sees the scene from earlier. A
man, covered in blood is lying in a pool of his own blood, two
kids are screaming from the top of the stairs, and the mom is
laughing demonically in the corner. Kevin starts to back up
slowly when the man slowly lies up, opens his eyes, and looks at
Kevin. He says “It all comes at a price.”
End Nightmare Sequence.
58. INT. KEVIN’S BEDROOM- NIGHT.
Kevin snaps awake. He sits up, breathing heavily.
Kevin:
Oh fuck.
59. EXT. FRONT DOOR OF CHLOE’S HOUSE- DAY.
Kevin stands at Chloe’s front door. He takes out his phone and
dials a number.
Kevin:
Yeah, I’m outside. Let me in.

A few seconds pass before Chloe opens the door and walks out.
Kevin:
So where are we going.
Chloe:
I’ll drive. Toss me the keys.
Kevin seems reluctant at first, but tosses Chloe the keys. They
both get in the car.
60. INT. KEVIN’S CAR- DAY.
Chloe starts the car and drives off.
Kevin:
So where are we going?
Chloe:
You’ll see. (A pause) How many times
have you been in class this week?
Kevin:
Not once.
Chloe:
Jesus Christ Kevin. It’s Friday. You
can’t miss a week of the class and be
fine.
Kevin:
Don’t act all high and mighty. You’re
home too.
Chloe:
I’ve missed two days. Two unimportant
days. You’ve missed several important
days. Plus you’ve missed five days of
every class. Remember you need English
to graduate, and if I recall you
weren’t doing so good in it.
Kevin:
I’ll be fine.
Chloe:

You keep saying that. Nothing good ever
happens after you say those words. (A
pause) Are you still having those
nightmares?
Kevin:
Yeah. Always the same one though.
Chloe:
That’s not good.
Kevin:
Yes, I know that. What can I do though?
I can’t really turn to my family, and
if I tell Mr. Broman he won’t let me
continue with the program, and say it’s
too emotionally stressful.
Chloe:
Stella’s going to be a social worker.
Tell her.
Kevin:
Not going to do that.
Chloe:
Beggars can’t be choosers.
Kevin:
She’ll say the same thing. Give up on
the program. I won’t give up.
Chloe:
Could have fooled me.
Kevin:
You don’t understand.
Chloe:
That’s true, I don’t. But I know
someone who might.
Chloe pulls into the parking lot of Fire station 9.
Chloe:

It’s C shift.
Kevin:
No. Turn back.
Chloe:
Shut up. You’re going to talk with
them.
Kevin closes his eyes, shakes his head, and then takes a deep
breath.
61. INT. FIRE STATION 9 DINING ROOM- DAY.
Kevin and Chloe are sitting at the dining room table, waiting.
Suddenly Miller and Thompson walk in.
Miller:
Kill me if I ever get that old.
Miller sees Kevin and Chloe at the table.
Thompson:
I can’t. You would have already killed
me a decade earlier.
Thompson sees Kevin and Chloe now.
Thompson (cont’d):
Well look what we have here.
Miller:
What brings you here Kevin? And..
Chloe:
Chloe.
Miller:
Chloe.
Chloe turns to Kevin. He says nothing. She rolls her eyes.
Chloe:
Kevin is taking what happened last week
really hard. He hasn’t been to class
all week, and he’s having nightmares
about it. He keeps saying he wants to
continue with the program he justKevin:

Can’t get it out of my head.
Miller turns to Thompson, who is looking back at her. They both
walk to the table and sit down.
Miller:
What’s are your nightmare’s about?
Kevin:
Always the same one. About that last
call. Blood everywhere.
Thompson:
My last call before I left Ireland was
a family of four, with two small
children, on their way back from church
who got crushed by a giant tree branch
after lightning struck it. I was very
religious back then, and when I first
got on scene, and saw what we had. . .
I don’t remember much from that day,
but I remember thinking how ironic it
was. For a family coming home from
God’s house, on his holiest day, only
for one of the most heavenly forces on
earth being the reason for their
demise.(Shakes head) So I had a
breakdown, and left Ireland to pursue
acting, believe it or not. But I was
not an actor. And months went by where
it just felt like something was
missing. And then one day out of the
blue I was driving to Baltimore to get
lunch when a biker was struck by a car
and was launched over an overpass for
about a twenty foot fall, right in
front of my car. I thought for sure he
was dead. I went up to him, and not
only was he alive, but he was awake and
alert. So I stayed with him until the
ambulance arrived, and he lived. Broke
almost every large bone in his body,
but lived. So after that I knew that I
had to get back to helping people. That
was what I was missing. If you have

that gene, that healing gene or
whatever you want to call it, then
you’ll never be out of the show too
long before you crave more.
Kevin:
How do I know if I have that gene?
Thompson:
By going through days like that and
still wanting more. The best EMTs are
the ones that have gone through one of
those calls that alter their being.
That shake them to their core.
Thompson (cont’d):
I can’t promise you, or even lie to you
that you’ll be fine. Truth is that only
you can find the path back. That’s when
you find out who you really are.
Miller:
Just know that it balances out. Last
week was an anomaly. You’re next 15
calls will range from boring to meh
before you get a (air quote) “good”
call. It doesn’t get any worse.
62. EXT. KEVIN’S FRONT YARD- DAY.
Kevin exits his car. He walks towards his front door. He is at
his front door when he hears a lot of loud chirping-almost like
a cry. He follows the noise over to a thorn bush near his house.
He sees a very beautiful Oriole caught in the thorn bush. He
grabs the bird with one hand, and frees it with the other. The
bird has a thorn in its side. He stares at the bird for a
second, and then pulls the thorn out. The Oriole flies away.
Kevin watches it fly off. He then falls to his feet, and puts
his head in his hands.
63. INT. EMT CLASSROOM- DAY.
Chloe is at her seat. She has a book open and is studying. Kevin
walks in the classroom and past Chloe. He goes straight to Mr.
Broman and gives him a note.

Mr. Broman:
Had that horrible intestinal bug that’s
been going around?
Kevin:
Oh, like you wouldn’t believe.
Mr. Broman:
You have a lot to make up Kevin.
Kevin:
I understand.
Kevin leaves the note and walks towards his seat next to Chloe.
He sits and Chloe just stares at him.
Kevin:
Yes Chloe?
Chloe:
Nothing.
64. INT. STARR FAMILY HOME- NIGHT.
Kevin and Chloe walk into his house. They walk to the kitchen.
Kevin’s mom is making dinner.
Mrs. Starr:
Hey guys.
Kevin + Chloe:
Hey.
Kevin (cont’d):
Where’s Stella?
Mrs. Starr:
Downstairs I think.
65. INT. STARR FAMILY BASEMENT- DAY.
The basement is almost like a gameroom. There is a POOL TABLE,
AIR HOCKEY TABLE, FOOSBALL TABLE, and a decent sized TV. Stella
is playing pool against Kacie. You can hear people walk down the
stairs, and then see Kevin, and Chloe moments later walk towards
the table.

Stella:
Oh, look who it is!
Stella walks up and hugs Chloe.
Stella (cont’d):
What’s it been, a year?
Chloe:
Something like that.
Kevin:
Why hello to you too.
Stella:
Oh hush. It’s only been three months
since we last saw each other.
Kevin:
Why are you guys down here?
Kacie:
Because mother’s being a biatch.
Kevin:
Already. You’ve been home an hour.
Stella:
Well that’s how long it took. Now about
you two; when do you guys take your
state boards?
Kevin:
A little over a month. I still only
have five calls though, so I’m going to
have to overdo it with the ride-along
shifts this month, in addition to
studying my ass off. You know, a normal
April.
Kacie:
You two are crazy. I don’t think I
picked up a pencil once in the two
months leading up to graduation. I
don’t remember anything about the final
two weeks at all, because all I did was

go to class, sleep, wake up when the
bell rang, and repeat six times a day.
It was fucking incredible.
Chloe:
Yeah, I’m probably gonna nap for like
two weeks after graduation to make up
for the times I couldn’t sleep in class
because I had to study. Just keep
telling myself that it will be worth
it, it will be worth it.
Stella:
I know how you feel.
Chloe:
Oh shit, that’s right, you graduate as
well in a few weeks, right?
Stella:
Yep. Three more weeks and I am done
with college and have to get a real
person job, in the real person world.
Chloe:
I’m so sorry.
Chloe pats Stella on the back.
Stella:
Thanks. So I’m guessing you’re here to
study.
Chloe:
Yep. Like Kevin said, we have to study
our asses off. (To Kevin) When is your
next ride-along shift anyway?
Kevin:
Easter Sunday. I figured why the hell
not. And the best part is that I’m
riding with Thompson, and Miller again.
Chloe:
I don’t know if that’s a good thing or
not.

Kevin:
Fingers crossed that God decides to be
chill on his holiest of days.
Kacie:
What’s the worst that could happen?
Kevin and Chloe look at Kacie, as if she had just risen from the
dead.
Kevin:
Oh, fuck…
66. RIDE ALONG SHIFT MONTAGE.
You see Kevin in his car looking at the fire station. He takes a
deep breath and opens his car door.
You see Kevin being greeted by Miller and Thompson. They are
laughing, and look like they’re having fun.
You hear the alarm ring, and see the three of them walk towards
the garage.
The ambulance is parked in the driveway of a small family home.
Miller opens the back door, Kevin jumps out, and they get the
stretcher out.
They are now inside. And elderly lady is sitting in a chair,
hands on her knees, looking like she’s having breathing
difficulties. Kevin is setting up an oxygen mask, and Thompson
is talking with a family member of the elderly lady.
Next we see Thompson, and Kevin in the back of the ambulance.
Thompson is writing stuff down, and Kevin is putting a blood
pressure cuff on the elderly ladies arm.
Next we see them in the ER. Kevin is at the nurse’s station
writing something. You see Thompson and Miller leave a patient’s
room.
END MONTAGE.
67. INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM- DAY.
Scene picks up where montage ended.
Miller:
So how many calls is that for you?
Kevin:

Six. Four more to go.
Miller:
How about this. If we get another call,
we’ll let you run it.
Kevin looks up from his writing.

Kevin:
A-what now? You mean like I’ll do the
patient assessment, treatment, get to
boss you two around, and just overall
run it?
Miller:
Yes sir.
Kevin:
Woah. That sounds... awesome.
Miller:
You didn’t see so sure. You don’t have
to if you don’t want to.
Kevin:
No, pardon my hesitation. That sounds
awesome.
Miller:
Alright let’s get ready to roll.
Hopefully we’ll get another call for
you. You ready?
Kevin:
I was born ready.
68. INT. FIRE STATION 9 DINING ROOM- DAY.
Cut to Kevin sitting alone at the dining room table. He is
staring at the clock, which reads 4:57. In comes Miller.
Miller:

There’s always next time. I’m sure you
probably have a few more shifts, maybe
one with us.
Kevin:
It is uncanny though. How the alarm
rings only when you don’t want it to,
and doesn’t when you do.
Miller:
Why else do you think I’m always so
excited for the next call? (A pause)
It’s random, more or less. Some days we
get eight calls, others two. Plus a
call right now we’ll be another hour or
so, and I’m sure you probably have some
Easter dinner to get to.
Clock now reads 4:59.

Kevin:
Yeah. They won’t wait up for me if I’m
late, so I should probably go.
Hopefully I’ll be back.
Kevin turns around and starts for the door. The alarm rings.
Kevin (cont’d):
Oh hell yes.
Miller:
No, go! You’ve got a dinner to go to.
Kevin:
Clock still reads 4:59. I can stay.
Miller:
That clocks
Kevin runs to the ambulance before Miller can object further.
Miller:
Slow.
69. EXT. FRONT YARD OF HUGE FAMILY HOME- DAY.

Everyone gets out of the ambulance. Kevin heads for the back
doors to get the stretcher.
Miller:
Hey. You’re running this thing. We got
the stretcher and you knock on the
door.
Kevin heads to the door. He takes a deep breath and knocks on
the door.
Kevin:
Fire department.
You can hear someone walk towards the door, and unlock it. A
woman, early 40s, opens up.
Sierra:
Oh, hello. Come in.
Kevin walks in and Miller, and Thompson follow.
70. INT. 1ST FLOOR OF HUGE FAMILY HOME- DAY.
Sierra:
I’m sorry for this, calling you guys
down on Easter Sunday. It’s probably
nothing serious, but the kids just
wanted to make sure their daddy was ok.
I’m Sierra by the way.

Kevin:
It’s not a problem at all. We’re always
ready to help, so don’t ever be sorry
to call 911.
They walked into the kitchen. Dinner was being cooked on the
stove. A man, 40s was sitting in a chair at the dining room
table. There was a little blood on his dress shirt. There was an
open first aid kit next to him, and he was holding a lot of
gauze to his left hand. You could see two preteen twin girls
standing in the far end of the kitchen. Kevin goes up to the
man.
Kevin:

Hello there. My name is Kevin and I’m
here to help.
Bill:
I’m Bill.
Kevin:
So Bill, what seems to be the problem
today?
Bill:
I was chopping up some onions for the
stuffing, and I guess I took my eyes
off the knife for a second, because I
sliced up my hand.
Kevin:
Can I take a look? Brody, can you take
vitals
The man extends his hand out slowly. Kevin carefully removes the
gauze. Underneath you see a gash, about an inch long, underneath
his ring and pinky fingers. It is not bleeding that much.
Kevin:
Can you feel this?
Kevin touches his fingers.
Bill:
Yes.
Kevin:
Can you wiggle your fingers?
Bill wiggles his fingers.
Kevin:
Awesome.
Bill:
So, is it bad?
Kevin:

No sir. I think you’ll just need some
stiches, and should be back to slicing
onions by tomorrow.
Sierra:
That’s great.
Miller hands Kevin some fresh gauze pads and some roller gauze.
Kevin grabs them and applies the gauze pads first, stacked on
top of each other, and then wraps the roller gauze around Bill’s
hand so that his entire hand, minus his fingertips, is covered.
Sierra:
So does he have to go to the hospital
with you guys?
Sierra looks at Kevin when she says that, but Kevin doesn’t
answer immediately.
Thompson:
(Looking at Kevin)Well that’s entirely
up to you guys. We’re here, so we can
if you want, but his injury isn’t too
severe, so you guys could drive him to
the hospital if you like, and he’d be
completely fine.
Bill:
Well I don’t want to further bother you
guys if we can just drive to the
hospital. Do you think I can wait until
after dinner?
Bill looks at Kevin. Again, he doesn’t answer immediately.
Miller:
I wouldn’t recommend it. You might need
stitches, and your hand is just going
to hurt, so that might bother you.
Hypothetically, you could, but again I
wouldn’t recommend it.
Bill:
Hmmm. Well thank you all very much. I
think we’ll drive separately to the
hospital, now. We’ll just put the food
in the fridge and reheat it later. I’m

sure you guys probably have some
firehouse Easter dinner to get to as
well.

Miller grabs something out of the red bag.
Miller:
Before you go can you just sign this
refusal form? Basically saying that we
came, we treated you, but you didn’t
leave with us.
Bill:
Sure. Luckily I’m right handed. (He
signs) Take care you guys.
Sierra walks Kevin, Miller, and Thompson to the door. She says
more thanks and goodbyes at the door, and then closes it.
71. EXT. FRONT YARD OF HUGE FAMILY HOME- DAY.
Kevin:
Well that sucked. So anti-climactic.
Miller:
Hypochondriacs are a pain in the ass to
deal with. I can deal going to some
retirement home to deal with almost
nothing that the nurses there overreact
to. It’s not the senile, and decrepit’s
fault that the people in charge of
their life don’t know their ass from
there forehead. However hypochondriacs
just take us out of service, when a
real emergency could be happening.
Miller lifts the stretchers onto the ambulance and everyone gets
in.
72. INT. AMBULANCE 96- DAY.
Thompson:

They do provide some good laughs
though. Jesus Christ, that guy in there
may not even need stitches. I was
trying to hold back my laugh in there
when Kevin lifted up the gauze.
Miller:
Oh yeah, good job in there. That’s
about as easy as it gets, and you
deserve easy because of that hell shift
way back when. I know it still bothers
me.
Kevin:
Thanks. Up to seven calls now!
Miller:
Sorry to tell you this, but you can’t
count it as a call because we didn’t
transport him to the hospital.
Kevin:
That’s some bullshit there. I may never
get ten calls.
Thompson:
You’ll be fine. State boards are always
in May, right?
Kevin:
Yeah, May fourth.
Thompson:
Plenty of time.
Kevin:
Yeah, but this is the last shift I have
with you guys though.
Miller:
(To Thompson) Why do we always drive
people away?
Thompson:

Hey, he lasted three shifts with us.
One more and he would have had the
record.
Miller:
Where else are you riding?
Kevin:
Station 2, C shift.
Miller:
Boring.
Kevin:
7, C shift.
Miller:
Bunch of sexist assholes.
Kevin:
And I think 10, B shift.
Miller:
No idea. (To Thompson) So we are one
ride-alongs favorite pair. We finally
made a difference!
Thompson:
Only took three years.
Thompson backs into the fire house garage.
73. INT. FIRE STATION GARAGE- DAY.
Cut to Thompson parks the car and everyone gets out.
Miller:
So you’re leaving now.
Kevin:
Yep.
Miller:
For the last time.
Kevin extends his hand.

Miller (cont’d):
Please.
Miller opens her arms and Kevin hugs her.
Miller:
Take care.
They release. Kevin then turns to Thompson. He extends his hand.
They shake.
Thompson:
Until next time, my friend.
Kevin:
I thought I had to be dead for you to
say that?
Thompson:
Not necessarily. I say it when one
journey ends, whether you be dead, and
leaving this earth, or just leaving
this fire station.
Kevin:
Take care Brody.
74. EXT. COLLEGE GRADUATION CEREMONY- DAY.
Cut to a college graduation. You see a stage at the front, with
ceremonious flowers and posters. There are also people seated on
the stage, both middle-aged and students mixed in. At the podium
is a girl in a black graduation gown.
In the lawn in front of the stage are rows of students in
matching gowns.

Valedictorian:
. . . and if I look at those photos
today I just can’t help but cry.
Congratulations Class of 2014.
Thunderous applause and cheers.

75. EXT. COLLEGE POST-GRADUATION CEREMONY- DAY.
In a crowd of people you see Stella weaving her way through
towards Kevin, Kacie, and Mrs. Starr. Stella has a huge, glowing
smile on her face.
Kevin:
Congratulations Stella!
Kevin hands her flowers.
Stella:
I’m a college graduate motherfucker!
Mrs. Starr glares at Stella, she notices.
Stella:
Oh please, you can’t yell at me today.
76. INT. FANCY-ISH RESTAURANT- DAY.
Cut to a nice Italian restaurant. You see a waitress hand Kevin
a coke and then walk away.
Kacie:
So when does your job hunt begin?
Stella:
Please, for the love of God, let today
be one day where the J word is not
mentioned.
Kevin:
You going to miss the college
experience, and all that?
Stella:
A little. Imagine senior year of high
school, but backwards. Freshman year
was like the end of senior year.
Magical and you almost didn’t want it
to end. Sophomore year was still badass
but didn’t have the same flare. Junior
and senior year were good, but it was
like September of senior year. Awesome
that I’ll be graduating soon, but
sooooo much work to do. And now that

it’s over I’m happy and excited, but
ready for what’s next
Kevin:
I know nothing of which you speak.
Stella laughs.
Stella:
Right, right. You’re getting close to
your state boards. Next week, right.
Kevin:
Don’t even remind me. I’ve practically
read that textbook cover to cover in
the last two weeks, and will have to do
it again in the next week. Plus I suck
at tying knots, so I better hope I
don’t have to splint a knee. Also I
still only have nine calls, and have no
more scheduled shifts so I’m gonna have
to find someone in class that does have
ten calls already and still has a
scheduled shift, and get them to give
me their shift.
Stella:
That’s rough. But just think that if
you do all of that, and pass the state
boards, you’ll be an EMT and get to do
cool shit and stuff. (To Kacie)How is
you’re teaching assistant stuff going.
What is it, third grade?
Kacie:
I go to elementary school, sit there
and then teach them how to write and
shit, and then go back to my dorm and
then split a bottle of wine with my
fellow teaching assistant roommate.
It’s not bad actually.
Mrs. Starr:

So is that where the money I put in
your account every month goes? Bottles
of wine?
Kacie:
It’s at the price of your daughter
getting a good education.
Mrs. Starr shakes her head. Kevin’s phone starts to vibrate on
the table.
Mrs. Starr:
Not at the dinner table.
Kevin:
We’ve got like ten minutes before the
food arrives
Mrs. Starr is giving a stern look that just shouts don’t you
dare.
Kevin:
Fine. I’ll be back before the food
arrives.
Kevin gets up and heads to the bathroom. He opens it and it’s
empty. He looks at his phone and sees it says Chloe called. He
calls her back
Chloe (V.O.):
KEVIN!
Kevin:
Yeah?
Chloe (V.O.):
You’re never gonna guess what happened.
Kevin:
I’m sure I won’t, so what happened?
77. CUT TO FLASHBACK- Int. RANDOM LIVING ROOM- DAY.
Cut to Chloe, and her two preceptors, entering a living room to
find an old man collapsed.
Preceptor 1 walks up and checks for pulse on the neck, places
his head right above the man’s mouth, and is looking at his
chest. He starts CPR. Preceptor 2 pulls out a BAG VALVE MASK,

and hooks it up to oxygen. Chloe walks over to the man and holds
the mask over the man’s face while the second preceptor squeezes
the bag every five seconds.
78. INT. FANCY-ISH RESTAURANT BATHROOM- INT.
Kevin:
That’s awesome. I’m g—
Chloe (V.O.):
Wait I’m not done. So after a minute or
so my preceptor says
79. CUT TO FLASHBACK- INT. RANDOM LIVING ROOM- DAY.
Preceptor 1:
Come here Chloe, switch with me.
Chloe moves from the mouth and shifts down so she’s right next
to Frank. After a few seconds he stops, and moves out of the
way. Chloe begins CPR, and she does it well.
80. INT. FANCY-ISH RESTAURANT BATHROOM- INT.
INTERCUT: Fancy-ish restaurant bathroom/Fire house parking lot.
Chloe:
I was almost perfect if you ask me.
Kevin:
Wow, Chloe that’s amazing. I really am
happy for you. So how’s the man?
Chloe:
What, oh he’s dead. But it doesn’t
matter because I was spontaneously
asked to do CPR, and I didn’t hesitate
for a second. Learn from your mistakes,
or something like that.
Kevin:
Absolutely. I still need to find
someone to give me their shift. I’m
still at nine calls. You still have a
shift, right?

Chloe:
No can do. I’m in the same boat, have
nine need one. I’ve got one more shift
day Tuesday. Then hell begins Thursday.
Hey, but at least we have off Tuesday.
Kevin:
Yeah I hear ya, but Tuesday will hardly
be a day off. So much to review, plus I
have to retest Module 9 Monday because
I almost failed it the first time.
Chloe:
We’ve reviewed the material enough.
You’ll crush it.
Kevin:
I hope so. Well I gotta get back to
dinner. See you Monday.
Chloe:
Tell Stella I said congrats!
Kevin:
Will do.
Kevin hangs up the phone.

81. INT. EMT CLASSROOM. DAY.
Kevin and Chloe are in the
some splints. A random kid
on his back, with his knee
with the splints. Chloe is

classroom, on the floor, messing with
from the class, Mark, is lying flat
bent. Kevin is sandwiching Mark’s leg
tying a knot.
Chloe:

Under the leg, make an x around the
splints, pull tightly, and then tie.
Kevin:
Well, then, I am thoroughly confused.
I’ve been doing around the leg, then
around both boards, and then tie.

Chloe:
That’s only for the knee knot. The
other two knots are what I’m doing.
Where were you when we learned this?
Kevin:
I don’t know.
Mr. Broman is
now. He keeps
don’t know if

I’m half here right now.
grading my Module test
looking over here. I
that’s good or not.
Chloe:

You worry a lot.
Mark:
He does. Like a girl on her period.
Chloe tightens the knot on Mark’s leg.
Mark:
Ow, ow, ow. Too tight.
Chloe:
Oops.
Marie (O.S.):
Hey Kevin.
Kevin turns around to see MARIE, someone random person from the
class.
Kevin:
Hey Marie. What’s up?
Marie:
I hear you are looking for a shift.
Kevin:
You heard right.
Marie:
I have one tomorrow that I don’t need,
and, to be honest, don’t really want to
go to because the preceptors are just
weird. You want it?

Kevin:
Yes, yes, absolutely. Thank you so
much.
Marie:
You’re welcome. It’s at Station 9
tomorrow from 9 am to 3.
Marie walks away.
Kevin:
Hey, Chloe, what shift is it tomorrow?
Chloe:
C, I believe.
Kevin puts his hands up, and looks up at the ceiling, as if he’s
celebrating.
Chloe (cont’d):
My shift starts at 8, excellent I found
myself a ride. Who knows, maybe we’ll
see each other in the ER.
Kevin:
That didn’t work out well last time.
Chloe:
You’ll be fine.
Mr. Broman walks up to Kevin. He hands him a SCANTRON.
Mr. Broman:
Congratulations. A 76. You can take the
boards on Thursday.
Once more Kevin puts his hands in the up, and looks up at the
ceiling, as if he’s celebrating.
Mark:
You guys done yet?
Kevin:
Shut up Mark. You’re ruining my moment.

Chloe:
Now if only you can get your English
grade up.
Kevin:
And you’ve killed it.
82. INT. HIGH SCHOOL CAFETERIA- DAY.
Kevin and Chloe are sitting at a lunch table. Chloe is eating a
sandwich. Kevin has a tray of food in front of him. He takes a
bite out of a chicken nugget. He stops chewing, stares at it,
puts it on his tray, and shivers in disgust.
Kevin:
Have you ever noticed those little vein
things when you bite into chicken?
Chloe:
No. But speaking of, have you seen that
picture on the internet of the live
human brain?
Kevin:
No.
Chloe:
Well there are like hundreds of
vessels, and different shades of red.
It’s really quite beautiful actually.
Kevin:
Interesting. I’ll check it out later.
Did you see the chapter in the textbook
where it’s nothing but pictures of
compound fractures and de-glovings?
Chloe:
Yeah I have. Oh my god that was so
gross looking.
Kevin:
Yeah it was straight up nasty. How was
your compound fracture guy?

Chloe:
It wasn’t that gross looking. Not a lot
of blood and the bone looked rather
white.
Kevin:
Man I wish I could have seen that.
Kevin and Chloe turn to see their classmates sitting at their
table all staring at them in disgust. One girl turned to her
sandwich in her hands, and then set it down. Chloe takes a huge
bite out her sandwich.

83. INT. KEVIN GETTING READY MONTAGE- DAY.
Cut to Kevin’s bedroom. The alarm is at 7:44. It switches to
7:45 and the alarm goes off. Kevin opens his eyes, moans, and
hits the alarm.
Cut to BATHROOM. Kevin is in the shower, but you only see a
blurry figure through the shower doors.
Cut to after shower, still in the bathroom. Kevin is brushing
his teeth. He puts his Fire and Rescue shirt on, and then spits
in the sink.
Cut to him in his kitchen. He is waiting by the toaster.
Something is in it. Suddenly a pop tart pops up and he grabs it.
END MONTAGE.
84. INT. FAMILY ROOM OF STARR HOUSE- DAY.
Stella and Kacie are watching a movie in the family room. Kevin
walks over to them, eating his pop tart.
Kevin:
Whatcha watchin’?
Kacie:
Gladiator.
Kevin:
At 8:30 in the morning?
Stella:

Her choice.
Kacie:
Please, this is an amazing movie. There
is not right time to watch a classic.
Kevin looks at the TV. It is right before Maximus dies.
Kevin:
This is the end. How long have you guys
been up?
Stella:
We never went to bed. We’ve just been
watching movies all night. (A pause)
You have a shift today?
Kevin:
Yeah I’m about to head out. Hopefully
my last shift.

Kevin (cont’d):
Get that elusive tenth call, take the
state boards at the end of the week,
and then collapse into a coma for a
month.
Kacie:
You still got like three weeks before
you graduate.
Kevin:
Don’t remind me. Get my last call, take
the boards, collapse for a weekend, and
spend the next three weeks taking a
page out of your book and not giving a
fuck. Well I’ll see you guys at 3 or
so.
Stella:
Alright, perfect. We were going to get
burgers at 4, so I guess you can come.
Kevin:

Cool. See you then.
Kevin walks towards the door.
Kacie:
Alright, which one next? Donnie Darko,
or Cabin in the Woods?
Stella:
I’m starting to realize how sadistic
you really are.
85. INT. KEVIN’S CAR- DAY.
Kevin is sitting in his car, looking at the fire station. He
takes a deep breath and opens his car door.
86. INT. FIRE STATION 9- DAY.
Cut to Kevin greeting Miller and Thompson. Kevin hugs Miller,
and shakes Thompson’s hand.
Miller:
When is it you take your state boards
again?
Kevin:
The written is in two days.
Miller:
Piece of cake.
Kevin:
Practical in three.
Miller:
You’ll cry. Did you bring your book?
Kevin:
Yeah.
Miller:
Good, we can help you study later.
Kevin:

Alright, awesome. Just need one call.
One more stinking call.
87. EXT. RANDOM STREET- DAY.
Cut to a random street. A beautiful day out. Tree’s blooming,
birds singing, and bikers out in the masses.
88. INT. NEW MERCEDES- DAY.
Businessman:
Fuck, fuck, fuck I cannot be late.
You see him press the accelerator, and here the car roar.
89. INT. RANDOM STREET- DAY.
Cut to a young lady, early 20s, riding her bike. She has a
helmet on.
90. EXT. VERY OLD COTTAGE- DAY.
Cut to a group or Orioles on top of a very old cottage. One
starts to fly. It starts to go across the street. It suddenly
gets hit by the Mercedes
91. INT. NEW MERCEDES- DAY.
Cut to the businessman in the Mercedes. You her a thud. The
business man is startled and drops his hot coffee on his lap.He
lets out a cry of pain and swerves his car right into the young
lady riding the bike.
92. EXT. RANDOM STREET- DAY.
Switch to a wide shot of the street. You see the young lady fly
through the air and crash through the wall of the very old,
almost ancient looking, falling apart, abandoned two story
wooden cottage, about ten feet from the road. The birds scatter
away.
The Mercedes swerves to the other side of the street into a lane
divider. The car goes air bourn momentarily, and then flips
several times, into another car, into a power line, and then
comes to a stop. The power line comes crashing down across the
street. The other car’s rear is almost obliterated. The camera
zooms out to get the entire aftermath on one shot.

93. INT. FIRE STATION 9 DINING ROOM- DAY.

Kevin is sitting at the table. Miller and Thompson have his
textbook and are flipping through it.
Thompson:
Six rights. What are they?
Kevin:
Right medication, right patient, right
time, right dose, right route, and
right documentation. That’s an easy
one.
Miller:
Alright, what is the main indicator of
preeclampsia?
Kevin:
High blood pressure. Go to the chapter
onThe alarm rings.
Kevin (cont’d):
Finally.
Automated Intercom:
Ambulance 96, and engine 71. Rescue.
Intersection of Ellicott National Pike
and Dorsett Road.
Thompson, Miller, and Kevin head towards the ambulance.
94. Int. Ambulance 96. Day.
Thompson is driving.
Thompson:
Hmm, what do I want to listen to?
Miller:
Please, no Mumford and Sons. There’s
only so many times I can listen to a
banjo.
Thompson:

Fair enough. Talking Heads it is then.
Thompson pushes a button. “Once in a Lifetime” by Talking Heads
starts.
Miller:
Meh, I’m okay with this one.
Thompson:
You like 80s rock, Kevin? What am I
saying, of course you do. You’re a
member of the human race. Of course, if
you didn’t I’d stop this ambulance
right now and kick you out.
Kevin:
Then I love it.
Thompson:
Ha. What’s your weakness than?

Kevin:
I’m more of an instrumental kind of
guy. I’ll just play on loop for hours
“The Lord of the Rings” soundtrack, and
the “PianoGuys”.
Thompson.
Cool, cool. I can get behind that. (A
pause) Well we’ve got traffic.
POV of Thompson. You can see a good amount of traffic ahead. He
then honks the horn several times so cars get out of the way.
Kevin:
So, I’m guessing car accident?
Miller:
Probably. A lot of the time it’s
nothing but property damage. We’ll see
though.
Kevin:

This is my last shift so it better be
the real deal. I need that tenth call.
Thompson:
You’re a little too eager for someone
to be hurt. I like it.
The ambulance pulls up to the scene. You see Thompson and
Miller’s faces turn grave as they see it. Police are already on
scene. Cut back to the scene. Focus on the downed power line.
Thompson picks up the radio.
Miller:
God Almighty.
Thompson:
Dispatch, this is ambulance 96 on
scene. We’ve got a down power line and
need the electricity shut off. Over.
Dispatch:
Copy, ambulance 96.
Miller:
Alright Kevin, behind your seat there
is a reflective traffic vest. Put it
on.
Kevin reaches behind his seat and pulls out the REFLECTIVE VEST.
It has EMT printed on the back of it.
Thompson parks a safe distance down from the power line.
95. EXT. RANDOM STREET- DAY.
The three of them get out of the ambulance. Kevin and Miller get
the stretcher.
Thompson:
Alright. Let’s see what we got.
They start walking towards the overturned car. Thompson pulls
out his flashlight. He kneels down next to the driver’s side and
shines inside. The body hanging upside down does not come into
focus, but you can tell it’s grim by Thompson’s facial
expression. You can also start to faintly here the engine truck
in the distance.
Thompson:

Yeah so he’s definitely dead.
Miller:
The police are talking with the guy
from that other vehicle. Let’s check
him out.
They walk over to the police officers and the man.
Miller:
You were in this car, sir?
Uninjured Man:
Yeah, I was. I’m fine. One minute I was
driving to the store, and the next I
see a car rolling towards my car, and
then BAM. I was lucky I guess.
Miller:
Very.
Cut to minutes later. The engine has arrived and they are
dealing with the two cars. The power has been shut down to the
power line as well.
Thompson:
That was a whole lot of nothing. (Turns
to Kevin, smiling) You alright?
Kevin shakes his head in disgust.
Kevin:
This is annoying. But I gotta stay
positive. I have like four more hours.
Thompson and Miller work on getting the stretcher back on the
ambulance. Kevin walks towards the side of the ambulance. He
sees something out of the corner of his eye. He turns his head
and sees a bike off the road in the grass. He starts to walk
towards it. When he gets to it he sees it’s badly mangled.
Kevin:
Hey guys.

Miller and Thompson are talking at the back of the ambulance.
They don’t appear to hear him. Kevin looks around. He sees the
ancient, run down cottage, with what appeared to be fresh debris
in the front of it, and a good sized hole in the front. He
starts to walk towards it. He stops about five feet from the
hole. He sees what appears to be a person.
Kevin:
HEY GUYS!
Miller and Thompson turn, and see Kevin.
Thompson:
What do you have?
Kevin:
I think we have another victim.
They start to walk over. Kevin suddenly sees the person’s foot
shake. His eyes open wide. He runs inside the house to check on
them.
Thompson:
Kevin, wait!
Kevin ignores him. He sees a young girl with a biking helmet on
covered in some moldy wooden debris. She has cuts all over her
body and has a chunk of wood impaled in her stomach. He kneels
down to her to check for a pulse, but instead sees her looking
at him. He jumps back and falls on his back. Suddenly the
cottage starts to shake, and then crumble. The second floor
comes crashing down on top of Kevin, and the first floor
collapses into the basement. Screen slowly fades to black as we
faintly hear Miller scream “Kevin”.
96. INT. LOUNGE ROOM OF FIRE STATION 2- DAY.
Fade In to a lounge area. You see Chloe, and two woman EMTs
sitting on couches and chairs.

Lady Preceptor 1:
. . . So what’s the worst that will
happen? Your class ends at the end of

the week, and if anything goes wrong,
you just go to college, or get a job,
and move on.
Chloe:
I don’t know. I’ve never really
considered it until this year. Kinda
scares me to be honest. I don’t want
anything to change, but at the same
time I want everything to.
Lady Preceptor 2:
Chloe, life’s too short to let fear get
in the way. Just look into your heart
and you’ll find the answer. You can
never be angry if you do that.
Chloe:
Yeah, I guess so.
The alarm rings.
Chloe:
Sweet. Number eleven.
Automated alarm:
Engine 22, Ambulance 26, Tower 7,
Ambulance 56, Tower 5, Engine 52,
Battalion Chief 2, Battalion Chief 7,
Battalion Chief 9. Rescue. Intersection
of Ellicott National Pike and Dorsett
Road.
Lady Preceptor 2:
Holy shit!
Lady Preceptor 1:
Damn, we got ourselves an AHOD.
Lady Preceptor 2:
This day just got interesting.
Chloe:
What’s an AHOD?
Lady Preceptor 1:

All hands of deck.

97. INT. CRUMBLED COTTAGE- DAY.
FADE TO BLACK. You can faintly hear people shouting. The screen
starts to get hazy. You see that this is POV Kevin. He sees
beams of light through the cracks. He is face up, and sees wood
everywhere. POV ends. Kevin has cuts on his face, including a
large one on his forehead. His right leg is pinned underneath a
large chunk of wood. He tries to escape but can’t. The biker
girl is to his left, almost out of reach. She has some medium
sized pieces of wood on her, but nothing too heavy. Kevin lifts
his head up, but coughs due to the dust.
Miller:
KEVIN! Kevin! Can you hear me?
Kevin:
Yeah. . .
Miller:
Don’t worry Kevin. We’re gonna get you
out of there.
98. EXT. RANDOM STREET- DAY.
You see the cottage is still standing, but it is tilted heavily
to one side, and looks like it’s about to come all down at any
minute. There is a few more police squad cars, ambulance 26,
engine 21, and battalion chief two on scene now, but you can
hear a lot of sirens in the distance. Battalion Chief Miller,
who was driving Battalion Chief 2, a balding man in his 50s,
walks towards Miller and Thompson.
Battalion Chief Roberts:
What the hell happened?
Thompson:
Our ride-along is trapped in the
building there. He spotted someone’s
bike over there in the grass and walked
over to it. Once he was there he
spotted its rider in the building. He

walked over to check on them and then
the building collapsed. He’s conscious
and talking to us now, but we can’t see
him.
Battalion Chief Roberts:
What’s his name?
Miller:
Kevin. Kevin Starr.
B.C. Roberts walks over towards the cottage. He looks up and
inspects it for a second. He then kneels down close to the front
of it.
Battalion Chief Roberts:
Hello, Kevin? Can you hear me?
Kevin (O.S):
Yes sir.
Battalion Chief Roberts:
Hello Kevin. My name is Tim Roberts.
I’m the Battalion Chief over at station
2. How are you?
Kevin (O.S):
I’m ok I guess. My head is killing me,
so I might have a concussion, but I’m
awake and talking to you, so that’s
good, right?
Battalion Chief Roberts:
Absolutely. Can you move at all?
99. INT. COLLAPSED COTTAGE- DAY.
Switch to Kevin. He tries to wiggle free, but his leg is pinned
pretty well.
Kevin:
No, my leg is pinned pretty badly. I
can’t move it at all.
Battalion Chief Roberts (O.S.):

I was told that you ran into the house
because you found the rider of the
bike. Are they still with you?
Kevin:
Yeah, a young girl. She’s lying right
next to me. She’s injured pretty
severely, so we need to get her out
soon.
Battalion Chief Roberts (O.S.):
Don’t worry Kevin, we’ll get both of
you out soon.
100. EXT. RANDOM STREET- DAY.
Switch to the above ground. B.C. Roberts turns to Miller and
Thompson.
Battalion Chief Roberts:
Alright, I want both of you to stand by
with him. If anything changes let me
know. I’m going to see if I can
organize a rescue squad.
B.C. Roberts walks towards the street. Thompson kneels down
towards the hole.

Thompson:
Oh, Kevin, you just had to be the hero.
Trying to get on that six o’clock news.
Kevin (O.S.):
Yeah, well, what can I say? I’m an
attention whore.
101. INT. COLLAPSED COTTAGE- DAY.
Camera switches to below ground. Kevin looks at the young girl.
He sits up and reaches towards the young lady. He can reach her
easily. He throws the wood off of her. He hears, and feels the
building quiver with the last piece of wood he throws. He looks
up and waits a few seconds to make sure nothing else happens. He
then proceeds to very slowly drag the young lady towards him. He
checks a pulse.

Kevin:
Hey Thompson.
Thompson (O.S):
Yeah?
Kevin:
I still have a pulse on the lady. . .
She’s got a decent sized chunk of wood
impaled in her lower right quadrant.
Blood is oozing out of it.
Thompson (O.S):
Alright. I take it you don’t have any
gauze or cravats down there. Just apply
pressure around the impaled wood with
your gloved hands.
Kevin puts his hands around the wood, forming a triangle, and
pushes down. He hears the lady moan.
102. EXT. RANDOM STREET- DAY.
Switch to above ground. You see Miller walk over to B.C. Roberts
and the group of firefighters in a circle. He is talking to two
EMTs when Miller walks up
Battalion Chief Roberts:
Alright you guys can head back to 5. I
don’t think we’ll need more than one
rig.
You see the two EMTs nod and walk towards Ambulance 56, as
Ambulance 26 pulls up.
Battalion Chief Roberts (cont’d):
We’ll have to cancel 26 as well then.
Miller:
I wouldn’t.
Everyone turns to look at her.
Miller (cont’d):
Our ride along just told us that the
biking victim is still alive, so we may

need 26 just in case she’s still alive
when we get them out.
Battalion Chief Roberts:
Right. They can stay then. (To
everyone) Alright so the issue we still
have is how do we excavate the
victim…victims, from the basement of
the cottage, without floors one and two
collapsing in in itself. That building
is pre-Civil war. The only reasons it’s
still standing is because of how old,
and historic it is.
Battalion Chief Roberts:
So it is just one heavy gust away from
toppling. So, how do we get them out?
Firefighter 1:
We could get the crane truck down and
piece by piece start picking the pieces
up one by one.
Firefighter 2:
That wouldn’t work. You ever play
KerPunk? Pull one piece of wood out and
you don’t know if that’s the one that
sends the marbles down. We just need to
drill a hole big enough to drag the two
of them out.
Miller:
It’s not that simple. One of them has
his leg pinned by falling debris. We
wouldn’t be able to pull him through
any hole unless we address that debris.
Plus I don’t think the building is
stable enough to do any drilling.
Chloe, Lady Preceptor 1, and Lady Preceptor 2 walk towards the
scene.
Lady Preceptor 1:
What do we got, good sir?

Battalion Chief Roberts:
A ride-along and a biker struck by a
car are at the bottom of that collapsed
building. Trying to brainstorm how to
excavate them.
Chloe:
Ride-along? (A beat) From what station?
Miller looks at Chloe.
Miller:
Oh shit.
Battalion Chief Roberts:
Nine.
Miller:
Chloe, wait!
Chloe ignores Miller, and looks up towards the building, as if
someone had just told her that he parents died. She takes off
running for the building. Millers grabs her, but Chloe elbows
Miller in the nose. Miller falls to the ground.
Miller:
Wait! BRODY GRAB HER!
Thompson turns around and lifts Chloe off her feet. She starts
kicking and elbowing him.
Thompson:
Quit it!
Miller jogs up to them, nose bleeding.
Miller:
Listen, Chloe. Kevin is alright. He’s
just caved in. We’re planning to get
him out.
Chloe relaxes, and looks up at Miller, a few tears on her face.
Chloe:
He’s alive?
Miller:

Yes. He’s fine for right now. They’re
going to work as quickly as possible to
get him out.
Chloe:
Let go of me.
Thompson releases. Chloe turns towards the building.
Chloe:
Can he hear me?
Miller:
Yes. Just don’t touch theChloe:
KEVIN! KEVIN! Can you hear me?
INTERCUT Random Street/Collapsed Cottage
Kevin:
Chloe?
She gives a very emotional laugh.
Chloe:
What did you do?
Kevin:
Oh nothing. Just saving a life.
Chloe (O.S.):
Someone else is down there?
Kevin:
Yeah, a woman. She’s badly injured, so
hopefully they get us out soon.
Chloe (O.S.):
Are you ok.
Kevin:
So much hurts right now, that you’re
going to have to duct tape me to my

chair tomorrow for the exam, just so I
can stay up.
Chloe:
Even trapped at the bottom of a caved
in building, you are still thinking
about the State Boards tomorrow. You’re
insane.
Kevin:
No, that’s focused. Eye on the prize,
eye on the prize. I’ve been through too
much shit to get here for a collapsed
building to stop me from taking that
test.
Chloe:
‘Cause fear does no one good, right?
Kevin:
Exactly. You have a textbook handy? We
can go over some chapters while we
wait.
END INTERCUT
103. EXT. RANDOM STREET- DAY.
We see B.C. Roberts walk towards them. Thompson walks over to
him first.
Battalion Chief Roberts:
She has got to go.
Thompson:
Sir, I wouldn’t. She’s calming him down
real well. Things can get very panic-y
if you’re in a death trap, so as long
as she distracts him from the
situation, she should stay.
B.C. Roberts takes a few seconds to think
Battalion Chief Roberts:
She better not get in the way then,
otherwise your ass is on the line.

Thompson:
Understood. So what are we doing?
Battalion Chief Roberts:
So as I understand, the woman is in
critical condition and not trapped
under anything. We’re gonna get her out
first by drilling a hole down to them,
and then pulling her out. After that
we’ll see what we got with Kevin, and
then plan his excavation.
Thompson:
You think the structure can support you
drilling into it?
Battalion Chief Roberts:
We have no idea. We’ll go slow and
strategic with the hole. It’ll be at
least an hour before we get everything
prepped for it though, so hopefully
nothing changes for the worse.
Battalion Chief Roberts walks toward the street. Thompson turns
to Chloe and Miller.
Miller:
So what’s the plan?
Thompson:
They’re gonna drill a hole and get the
woman out, and then see what they have
with Kevin before they do anything with
him. You hear that Kevin?
Kevin (O.S.):
Yeah I heard it? How long?
Thompson:
About an hour.
Kevin (O.S.):
Going to be cutting in close. She’s
gonna be in rough shape in an hour.
Thompson:

Just keep holding pressure and let us
know if anything changes.
Chloe:
Sorry if I hurt you. It’s just Kevin
and I have been best friend since we
were five, so it’s hard to restrain
yourself when you think your best
friend just died.
Thompson:
Don’t worry about it. You can just
bring a cake to the fire house next
shift to make up for it.
Miller:
An ice cream cake.
Thompson:
An ice cream cake.
Kevin (O.S.):
Well, fuck. If you get me out I’ll
bring you a cake every shift you have
for the rest of the year.
Chloe kneels down to expect the collapsed building in front of
her.
Chloe:
It looks if we could just move this one
piece of wood there we might be able to
see them.
Chloe places her hand on the wood
Thompson:
STOP!
The building starts to shake, and a chunk of the chimney break
off and lands in the grass to the left of the building.
Everything calms back down and you see Chloe exhale loudly.
Miller:
It’s don’t touch the building. Do you
understand?
Chloe nods.

104. INT. CRUMBLED COTTAGE- DAY.
CUT TO BLACK. Camera cuts back to below ground. It is clear that
this is Kevin’s POV, and that he just opened his eyes. You hear
him exhale. He looks up and sees a lot of dust trickling down
from above. Follow the dust down onto the woman’s face. She
coughs. Kevin stares at her. She opens her eyes.
Kevin:
Can you hear me?
Chloe (O.S.):
Kevin! Kevin are you there?
The woman’s eyes focus on Kevin.
Annabel:
Where am I?
Chloe (O.S.):
KEVIN! Kevin, answer me!
Kevin:
(To the sky)I’m fine! (To the woman)
We’re trapped under a collapsed
building. What’s your name?
Annabel:
Annabel.
Kevin:
That’s a pretty name. I’m Kevin.
Annabel:
Is that you pushing on my stomach?
Annabel’s hands move towards her stomach and they hit the wood?
Annabel (cont’d):
Wha-What is that? Get off me!
Annabel starts to squirm. Kevin keeps his hands where they are
though. You hear a piece of wood snap above them.
Kevin:
You have to calm down. If you don’t
this building could collapse. You have
a piece of wood impaled in your

stomach. If I move then you could start
to bleed out.
Annabel is still having a panic attack.
Annabel:
No, no, no I can’t. I have to get out
of here. I can’t be stuck down here.
You have to get off of me, I have to
leave.
Kevin:
You have to stop Annabel. Look at me.
She is still squirming. Kevin sternly says.
Kevin (cont’d):
Look at me!
Annabel turns and looks at Kevin, tears in her eyes.
Kevin (cont’d):
There you go. Now we’re going to take a
deep breath together on three, ok? Can
you do that?
Annabel nods.
Kevin (cont’d):
1 . . . 2 . . . 3 . . .
They both take deep breaths.
Kevin (cont’d):
There you go. That’s better. You’re not
alone. We’re not alone. The fire
department is right outside, on the
street trying to get us out. (To the
sky) Hey Chloe.
Chloe:
What?
Kevin:
Just making sure you were there. (To
Annabel) That’s Chloe. And there are
dozens more up there that can help us.

Annabel:
I’m scared.
Kevin looks up for a second and then whispers…
Kevin:
You want to know a secret? I’m scared
too. They teach you how to save a life,
and how to run towards the danger, but
they don’t teach you how to deal with
what comes next. They don’t teach you
what happens when someone dies, or what
happens when someone with terror in
their eyes, looks at you for help, and
you can’t do anything. They don’t teach
you what to do if a building collapses
on you, and you’re injured and trapped.
Not knowing is the scariest part. (A
pause) But let’s learn together.
Annabel:
Are you alright?
Kevin:
I’ll be fine. They just need to get
this wood off of me. How about you
though. You got hit by a car, and went
flying into a building. I gotta be
honest I didn’t expect you to be
anywhere near fine when I found you.
Annabel:
My mother said to have faith in God,
and he’d protect me. And to always wear
a helmet.
Kevin laughs.
Kevin:
Smart lady. Since we’re stuck down here
for a little while long, why don’t we
get to know each other?
Miller (O.S.):
Keep her talking Kevin.

Kevin:
She wants you to keep talking as well.
Annabel:
Alright. I’m twenty three. I’m just in
town to visit my mom before I head off
to Europe on Friday. I’m guessing
that’s not happening now.
Kevin:
Nonsense. You’ll be out of the hospital
in plenty of time for your flight.
Annabel:
Let’s hope. What about you?
Kevin:
I’m eighteen. Still in high school, and
I’m here because I’m an EMT ride-along.
Annabel:
So you’re not even a real EMT?
Kevin:
Nope. But I’m the best that you have
down here.
Overhead you can hear a helicopter approaching.
105. INT. STARR FAMILY HOME- DAY.
You see Mrs. Starr walk in the front door of the house carrying
a grocery bag.
Mrs. Starr:
Are you two still up?
No response. Mrs. Starr walks into the kitchen. She looks over
and sees Kacie and Stella staring at the TV.
Mrs. Starr (cont’d):
Anyway, Stella you remember Jane
Sweller’s mom right?
No response.
Mrs. Starr (cont’d):

Well I ran into her at the store and
she was just going on and on about her
job with the board of education.
Apparently she’s head of the county’s
guidance counselors, or something like
that. I told her you just got your BSW
and she said that the county is soon
looking to hire some social workers.
How does that sound?
No response. Mrs. Starr walks towards the family room.
Mrs. Starr:
Are you even listening to me?
No response. Mrs. Starr turns to the TV. It is a live feed
breaking news report of the accident that Kevin is the victim
off.
TV Anchor:
Little details are yet known, only that
there is one fatality and that traffic
is at a standstill. There are reports
out there that a member of the Fire
department is trapped in that building.
Mrs. Starr:
I don’t understand.
Kacie:
Hush. Wait for it.
Kacie points to the TV. A camera crew is right in front of a
police line, having an interview.
Kacie:
Alright pause!
Stella hits a button on the remote. Kacie walks up to the TV.
The TV shows an unobstructed view of the house and of Miller,
Thompson, and Chloe a few feet from it.
Kacie:
I don’t know about you guys, but that
looks a lot like Chloe.
Stella:

Oh shit, it is her. You were right.
I’ll record this, and we’ll show her
this later. I wonder if Kevin’s there.
Kacie:
Call him.
Stella takes out her phone, presses a few buttons, and puts it
to her ear.
Mrs. Starr:
He won’t answer if he’s at the scene.
It’s unprofessional.
Stella:
Yeah no answer. What time is it?
Mrs. Starr:
Almost eleven.
Stella:
Alright I’m going to take a nap then.
Don’t make dinner because the two of us
and Kevin are going out for dinner.
Stella walks out. Kacie is still looking at the TV.
Kacie:
Something just feels wrong with this
thing. I don’t know what it is. I guess
I’ll go take a nap too. If we’re not up
by 3, wake us up.
106. EXT. STREET OF ACCIDENT- DAY.
We see a group of men guide a WELL DRILL towards the cottage.
The drill is very long, about twenty feet, and lean. It looks
like something you’d drill into concrete.
Thompson:
What the fuck is this?
Battalion Chief Roberts:
Our plan.

You see Thompson look up in astonishment at the tall drill.
Thompson:
That building would collapse if you
turned that drill on from the street.
No way is it going to drill a hole down
to them without shaking the building
further off its foundation.
Battalion Chief Roberts:
That’s why we’re bringing two cranes in
to latch onto the top of the building,
relieving some of the stress off the
weakened supports.
Thompson:
We’re the fuck is that in the protocol
manual?
Battalion Chief Roberts:
None of this is in the protocol manual.
Usually we don’t have two live bodies
to rescue in a collapsed building or
cave in. It’s almost always a recovery.
Thompson:
How do they get people out in mining
tunnels when they are trapped?
Battalion Chief Roberts:
Mountains are much stronger than this
building. You can drill into a mountain
for hours and not worry about it
collapsing. Right now we’re trying to
rescue people from the bottom of the
ocean without getting wet. (A pause)
The cranes should arrive momentarily.
Battalion Chief Roberts turns and goes to talk to someone
guiding the drill. Thompson turns his head and sees Chloe
staring at him, with a look of defeat. Thompson has the same
look.
107. INT. CRUMBLED COTTAGE- DAY.
Kevin is still holding pressure on Annabel’s stomach. You can
hear Kevin’s phone vibrate in his pocket.

Annabel:
Aren’t you going to answer it?
Kevin:
What, and take my hands of your
gorgeous body? Not a chance?
You see Annabel smile.
Annabel:
It’s just, you never know when the last
time you’ll speak to your loved ones
will be. IKevin:
Well then it’s a good thing this is not
the last time I’ll speak to them.
Annabel:
You’re not in control of that.
Kevin takes a second. He sounds afraid.
Kevin:
Not like this. I don’t plan on dying in
the basement of some building that
should have been torn down decades ago.
Kevin (cont’d):
I may not have control, but damn it, if
that happens . . . then what’s the
point, ya know?
Annabel:
Be joyful in hope, patient in
affliction, and faithful in prayer.
Romans 12:12.
Kevin:
I’ve always wanted a friend that could
recite bible verses at will. Say what
you will, but it’s a talent.
Annabel:

Be serious. We just have to be patient,
and the lord will answer our prayers.
Kevin:
I’ve never been of a prayer.
Annabel:
It’s never too late.
Thompson (O.S.):
Alright guys. It’s show time.
Kevin’s phone vibrates again.
Annabel:
You don’t want to leave this world
without telling people what they meant
to you.
108. EXT. RIGHT OUTSIDE THE COTTAGE- DAY.
You see two cranes placed at opposite sides of the house. The
well drill is angled towards the basement, and everyone not
working the machines is watching. Lady Preceptor 1 and Lady
Preceptor 2 have their stretcher prepped for Annabel.
Battalion Chief Roberts:
(Into a walky)
Alright. We want to hook the crane onto
the building, and pull out all the
slack, and nothing more. I do not want
to see any part of the building move an
inch. On my go.
Battalion Chief Roberts aims a thumbs up towards someone on the
street, who returns a thumbs up.
Battalion Chief Roberts (cont’d):
Go.
The cranes arms move almost simultaneously towards the top of
the building. Both aim for the window frames. Both hooks are in
the building, via the window. Very slowly the drawstring of the
cranes move and pull the hook up. They stop when the hook is
embedded in the window frame. Everyone holds their breath at

once. The building does not move. They have provided some
stabilization.
Battalion Chief Roberts:
(Into his walky)
Nice job boys. Alright prep the drill.
Miller goes towards the building.
Miller:
Alright Kevin, they successfully have
the cranes in place. Now they’re going
to start drilling. I need both of you
to cover your eyes and look away from
the ceiling. It’s going to get very
dusty and splintery.
109. INT. COLLAPSED COTTAGE- DAY.
Annabel unclips her helmet strap, and removes her helmet. She
places it on Kevin’s head.
Annabel:
You need this more than I do.
This is the first time Kevin’s really looked at Annabel’s face.
She really is gorgeous, and has long auburn hair, and deep blue
eyes.
Kevin:
I’ll see you on the other side.
110. EXT. RIGHT OUTSIDE THE COTTAGE- DAY.
You see Battalion Chief Roberts give the drill operator a thumbs
up. You hear the drill start.
Miller:
This is a horrible idea.
Chloe:
Have faith.
The drill starts to move forward towards the cottage. It makes
contact and you hear an uncomfortable grinding sound. The
building does not move.

111. INT. COLLAPSED COTTAGE- DAY.
Cut to Kevin and Annabel. There is a lot of dust and splinters
coming down from above. Annabel’s eyes are closed, but she is
saying a prayer. The ground is vibrating. All of a sudden a
drill comes punching through from an angle above Kevin. It moves
forward slightly before stopping.
112. EXT. RIGHT OUTSIDE THE COTTAGE- DAY.
Drill operator:
We’re through! Shutting off drill.
You can hear the motor start to die down.
Drill operator (cont’d):
Pulling drill out.
Slowly you see the drill come out of the cottage. About four
feet of the drill was used.
Drill operator (cont’d):
Backing drill up.
You see the drill slowly start to pull back from the fresh hole.
Chloe, and Miller run over to the hole. Chloe gets there first.
She looks inside. She sees someone with a biking helmet on about
five feet below. The hole has a diameter of about three feet.
Just big enough for someone to crawl through.
Chloe:
Kevin! Look up!
Kevin turns his head to look up, knocking the unfastened helmet
off his head. He sees Chloe, and a bright light.
Kevin:
Ah, too bright.
Chloe steps aside and Miller is now looking down the hole.
Miller:
You look terrible. How are you guys?
Kevin:
I’m fine.

Kevin turns to Annabel.
Kevin (cont’d):
And you?
Annabel:
Fine.
Kevin:
(To Miller)
We’re both fine.
Miller:
Good. Alright Kevin, they’re going to
send someone down to get Annabel out.
Then they’ll see your situation and
plan how to get you out.
Kevin:
Sounds good. (To Annabel) Ready to go
to Europe?
Annabel:
So very ready.
From above you can hear someone coming through the hole. Kevin
looks up and sees a man, in full fire turnout gear, making his
way carefully down. He has a rope attached to his turnout coat.
Rescuer:
How are you two?
Kevin:
We’re fine. She’s just waiting for her
knight in shining armor.
Rescuer:
Here he comes! Alright so are you
trapped or pinned under anything Miss?
Annabel:
No, I can move.
Rescuer:
And I see that wood impalement there.
The Rescuer turns to look at the hole.

Rescuer:
It shouldn’t be a problem. Alright miss
I’m just going to lift you up and then
set you down on that backboard that is
behind me in the hole.
Kevin turns his head and sees a long spine backboard in the
hole.
Rescuer (cont’d):
Alright, are you ready?
Annabel nods. The rescuer gets into position to lift Annabel.
Rescuer (cont’d):
Ok on three. One, two, three.
The rescuer lifts Annabel up and Kevin releases his hands. The
rescuer is on his knees, crouched down, and just shuffles
towards the hole. He extends Annabel onto the backboard and
slides her up.
Rescuer:
Hold onto the backboard. (To the
street) Alright pull her out.
Annabel:
(To Kevin)
Always have faith.
Annabel was pulled up, and out of the hole. And then she was
gone. The rescuer stayed down the hole. He turned to Kevin and
expected his predicament. Kevin, finally not having to hold
pressure, sat flat on his back.
Rescuer:
Well, you are jammed in here pretty
good. I have a few ideas that I’ll go
run by the group and see what we can
come up with. I’ll keep you posted.
The rescuer grabbed Kevin’s hand, and looked at him.
Rescuer:
Hang in there.
And he left. Kevin takes off his bloody gloves and gets his
phone out of his pocket. He sees he has two missed calls from

Stella. He stares at his phone for a few seconds and calls
Stella.
Kevin:
Hey Stella. Just calling to let you
know I won’t be able to make it for
dinner later. You and Kacie have fun
without me and I love you two.
Kevin ends the message, and puts his phone in his pocket when he
looks up and sees Thompson.
Thompson:
I don’t like phone conversations that
end that way.
Kevin:
How do you know I’m not one to always
end phone conversations with “I love
you?”
Thompson:
Who are you trying to fool? Today is
not the day you say your goodbyes, you
hear me? It will be in seventy years,
warm in your bed with your family
surrounding you saying their goodbyes.
Kevin:
We can’t control that.
Thompson:
No, but we’ll be damned if we don’t
believe we can.
Kevin:
Unyielding stubbornness is part of
being human I guess. So how long until
I’m out of here?
Thompson:
I heard a few hours. So looks like
we’ll have some time to talk.

113. TIME PASSING SCENE.
Cut to a shot of the sun in the sky at its highest point, aka 12
noon. Then cut to a tree with no apparent shadow. Then have a
fast forward shot of the tree where a shadow slowly appears to
the right of the tree.
114. INTERCUT CRUMBLED COTTAGE/RANDOM STREET- DAY.
Chloe and Kevin are talking. Chloe has a textbook.
Chloe:
Alright, what drug always require
medical consult?
Kevin sits up and his
drenched in sweat and
brings his hands over
the lowest point that
can see it pulsating.

hands are shaking. His forehead is
his face is drained of its color. He
to his trapped leg and rips his pants at
he can. His leg is very swollen and you
Chloe:

Kevin, did you hear me?
Kevin:
Activated Charcoal.
Chloe:
Correct. Alright you ask a question
now.
Kevin:
What is compartment syndrome and what
are its symptoms.
Chloe:
Compartment Syndrome? Oh, I know this.
It’s when pressure builds up in a part
of the body, usually due to it being
crushed. Symptoms are an aching pain,
swelling, and a pins and needle
sensation.
Kevin:
Good. What happens if it goes
untreated?
Chloe:

Uhh, death I believe.
Kevin lays flat on his back. He looks to his left and sees a
wooden beam slowly start to splinter up, as if it’s about to
explode. He looks up and sees that the only thing keeping the
first and second floors in place is a few floor boards above,
buckling under the weight. He closes his eyes tightly.
Kevin:
Correct. (A beat) Chloe I don’t think
I’m going to make it.
That got Chloe’s attention. She stuck her head in the hole very
quickly and just looked at Kevin.
Chloe:
You shut your mouth. You remove every
thought like that from your head right
this instant, and you think rainbows
and waterfalls and shit like that, got
it?
Kevin just stares into space, as if he didn’t hear Chloe.

Kevin:
What’s the worst that could happen? (A
weak laugh) I said that to you after
orientation last summer. What’s the
worst that could happen? (A stronger
laugh) Only now can I fully appreciate
the naivety of that statement. If I
could go back in time I’d slap myself
in the face for that. If you could go
back would you do it again?
Chloe is starting to tear up.
Chloe:
Do what again?
Kevin:
This. All of this, the entire
experience.
Chloe:

Knowing what I know now?
Kevin:
Especially what you know now.
Chloe:
In a heartbeat. The last eight months
in this class with you have been some
of the best in my life. I wouldn’t
trade any of it for anything.
Kevin:
Always remember that.
Chloe:
Kevin stop it. You’re freaking me out.
Here, I think I can get down there. I
just haveKevin:
Don’t do it Chloe.
Chloe:
No, no. I’m tired of sitting around
waiting. I’ll be down in a minute.
Kevin:
Alright, alright. Before you do, can
you go in ambulance 96 and get me my
cell phone. I need to call Stella and
tell her I won’t be making dinner
tonight.
Chloe’s face looks puzzled.
Chloe:
Uhh, sure. I’ll be back in a minute.
Chloe walks away. Kevin hears more splintering, and feels more
shaking. Kevin reaches in his back pocket and pulls out a bunch
of gloves. He takes one. He reaches into a front pocket and
pulls out a pen. He writes something on the glove.
115. INT. AMBULANCE 96- DAY.

Cut to Chloe opening the door to the ambulance, and looking
around for a phone.
116. INT. CRUMBLED COTTAGE- DAY.
Cut back to below ground. Thompson appears in the hole.
Thompson:
Hey man. How you holding up.
Kevin:
Hey Thompson. . . Brody, promise me one
thing.
Thompson:
Sure. What is it?
Kevin:
Promise me you never forget why you
became an EMT
Thompson:
Excuse me?
Kevin:
You’re a gifted EMT, and a great
person. The world needs more of you.
After today, promise me you’ll always
see that, and that you won’t run away
again.
Thompson:
This sounds like a goodbye.
Kevin:
And please make sure Chloe stays the
course, and completes the program, no
matter how torn apart she is after
today.
Thompson:
Kevin, they’re almost ready to get you…
Kevin:
Just promise me that!

Thompson:
Ok, Kevin, I promise.
There is a chain reaction of very loud snaps from above.
Thompson:
(To the street) Let’s hurry it up! (To
Kevin) I can’t let this happen. I
won’t. It will not end like this.
Kevin:
You’ve done all you can.
Thompson:
NO! Just hold still. They’ll get you.
More loud snaps. The building starts to shift. Kevin reaches up
and grabs Thompson’s hand with both of his.
Kevin:
Until next time, my friend.
Thompson looks at Kevin, tears welling up in his eyes. Kevin
releases Thompson’s hand.
The building suddenly starts to crumble for good. Miller runs
and pulls Thompson out of the hole, and away from the house. The
second floor caves in on the first, and the first caves in on
the basement. The building is no more, just a giant mound of
rubble.
117. SHOTS OF THE IMPORTANT PEOPLE IN KEVIN’S LIFE.
Cut between these shots, no sound:
Mr. Broman is at a desk, typing on a computer.
Kacie and Stella are at a restaurant, having a good time.
Mrs. Starr is watching a TV show.
Annabel is on an operating table.
Kate Prestman is feeding her baby in his highchair.
Chloe is on her knees seeing if Kevin’s phone fell under the
seat in the back. You see her stop, get up, and walk towards the
ambulance door. She stops in the doorway and looks at what just

happened with horror on her face. She walks towards the scene,
camera never showing the collapsed cottage. Miller walks over to
Chloe, but she waves her off with her hand. Finally the camera
turns to the cottage. It’s gone, all collapsed. Debris is
everywhere. Chloe looks over at Thompson. He’s sitting on his
butt, leaning back on his elbows, in a defeated way. He turns to
Chloe, eyes red, and tears down his face. Chloe walks over to
him and sits right beside him, and leans on him. Thompson
extends his hand to Chloe. There is a glove on it. She grabs it,
un-crumples it, and reads it:
Chloe,
Always be exceptional.
Love Kevin.
She turns to Thompson, and then back at the glove. They cry
together.
118. INT. STREET OF ACCIDENT- DUSK.
Later Chloe, now with a blanket around her shoulders, is sitting
on the ground, leaning against ambulance 96, tight grasping the
message glove.
119. INT. ENDING SCENE FLASHBACK- DAY.
Cut to earlier in the day. Kevin and Chloe are in his car.
Chloe:
Alright. Shall we take a moment to
plead with God to allow two of his
children to get hurt, so that we may
both get our tenth calls?
Kevin:
I think your mean plead with Satan.
Chloe:
If that’s what it takes.
Kevin laugh.
Kevin:
Relax, we’ll get ten. Just think, we
get certified in three days, graduate

high school in a few weeks, apply for a
career as EMTsChloe:
After I file harassment against
Delmonico.
Kevin:
Yes after that, and then…
Chloe:
And then we be the preceptors for some
poor souls.
Kevin:
Ha! We’d be the greatest duo ever. And
then after that we spend years rising
the ranks. Maybe get our paramedic
license.
Chloe:
And then why don’t we just be the
bosses. We’re going to run this county
one day.
Kevin:
No, you’ll be running this county.
Chloe:
Well, yes, but you can be my. . .
secretary or something.

FADE TO WHITE.
120. END
