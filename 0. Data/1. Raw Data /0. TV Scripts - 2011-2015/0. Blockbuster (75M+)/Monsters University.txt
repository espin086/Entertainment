EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY
A bird lands on the ground. It pecks at something, then the
head stays up and another head pecks at the ground. It turns
and we see that it has two heads.
It squawks and flies off....
A SCHOOL BUS makes its way down the street. Singing can be
heard from the kids inside. Pan up to reveal “Frighton
Elementary” on the side of the bus.
KIDS
(singing)
The neck bone’s connected to the:
head bone. The head bone’s
connected to the: horn bone. The
horn bone’s right above the...wing
bones.
(laughing)
The bus pulls into a parking lot.
The bus doors open and a THIRD GRADE CLASS OF MONSTER KIDS
pour through, pushing and yelling and laughing and being
generally chaotic.
RAHR!
Ahh!

KID #1
KID #2

KID #1
I scared you!
KID #2
(laughing)
No you didn't!
MRS. GRAVES
Okay, remember our field trip rules
everyone: No pushing, no biting,
and no fire-breathing.
One of the kids breathes fire on one of his friends.

RAHR!

A TEACHER MONSTER, MRS. GRAVES, stands over him, giving him a
stern look.
MRS. GRAVES
What did I just say?

one. Who are we missing?
ON THE CLOSED BUS DOORS.
A little green hand knocks on the windowed doors.
ON MRS. GRAVES.
MRS. GRAVES (CONT’D)
(realizing - this isn’t
the first time...)
Oooh, Mike Wazowski.
The bus doors open revealing a very tiny, 8-year-old Mike
Wazowski, smiling.
YOUNG MIKE
Thanks Joe! Good luck finishing
your crossword puzzle!
MRS. GRAVES
Sorry, Michael! I didn’t see you.
Mrs. Graves approaches and Mike jumps down. When Mike hits
the ground, we see how much bigger all the other kids are.
YOUNG MIKE
That’s okay. When I was on the
bus, I found a nickel!
Mike walks away, holding the nickel.
YOUNG MIKE (CONT’D)
(sotto)
I wish I had pockets....
MRS. GRAVES

Okay, everyone, partner up.

Mrs. Graves approaches and smiles bitter-sweetly.
MRS. GRAVES
Well, Michael, it looks like it’s
you and me again.
YOUNG MIKE
(small laugh)
Mrs. Graves takes Mike’s hand.
Mike sees the kids walking up ahead.
YOUNG MIKE (CONT’D)
(to his teacher)
C’mon Karen, we’re falling behind.
Mike tugs on Mrs. Graves’ hand, pulling her toward the other
students.
MRS. GRAVES
(laugh)
Please don’t call me Karen.
As we crane up, REVEAL we’re at Monsters, Incorporated.
INT. MONSTERS, INC. - HALLWAY
Mrs. Graves’s class is met by a monster TOUR GUIDE.
MI TOUR GUIDE
Now stay close together, we're
entering a very dangerous area.
The field trip is entering a scare floor.

MI TOUR GUIDE (CONT’D)
Welcome to the scare floor.
The students are in awe as they see the scare floor.
KIDS
(walla)
Whoa!
MI TOUR GUIDE
This is where we collect the scream
energy to power our whole world.
And can anyone tell me whose job it
is to go get that scream?
Scarers!

KIDS

MI TOUR GUIDE
That’s right! Now which one of you
can give me the scariest roar?
KIDS
(raising hands)
Ooh! Ooh! Me! Me!
Mike has his hand raised too.
YOUNG MIKE
Ooh, sir! Right here, little green
guy at 2 o’clock!
Roar!

RAAAAAOOWRRRRRRRR!
The kids turn around.
Whoa...
Whoa.

KID #1
KIDS

The entire group of kids is staring at Mike, eyes wide. He
is amazed, for the first time all eyes are on him. Then,
Mike realizes the kids are actually looking PAST him. Mike
turns and his eye goes wide too. A group of SCARERS are
walking onto the scare floor - confident, cool, and awesome.
Whoa.

YOUNG MIKE

One of the scarers approaches the kids.
worn-in MU cap.

He wears an old,

MU SCARER
Well, hey there kids! Are you on a
tour with your school?
KIDS
(cheering)
Yeah!
MRS. GRAVES
Yes, we’re here to learn about
scream energy, and what it takes to
be a scarer!
MU SCARER
Well hey, you’re in luck. Because
I just happen to be a scarer! I
learned everything I know from my
school, Monsters University.
YOUNG MIKE
(in awe)
Whoa...
MU SCARER
It’s the best scaring school there
is.
Another scarer, sneaks up behind him and takes his hat.
FEAR TECH SCARER
You wish, Fear Tech’s the best.

6.
The MU scarer snatches his hat back, smiling.
MU SCARER
Okay, you guys watch us and tell me
which school's the best. Alright?
(whispered, he
surreptitiously points to
his cap)
MU is.
Employees (Scarers, assistants, can wranglers, etc.) start to
stream onto the floor. The tour guide ushers Mike and the
students to a viewing area.

watching, he puts a foot past the line.

Not

MI TOUR GUIDE
Oops. Stop right there. Don’t
cross over that safety line, human
children are extremely toxic.
Mike steps back and watches all the activity, in awe. But
just as the doors start to get wheeled onto the floor, the
bigger kids push their way to the front, blocking Mike’s
view.
KIDS
(excited walla)
Look at that!
YOUNG MIKE
Whoa - hey...guys, watch the eye!
Ow!
Mike pops out from the back of the crowd and falls on his
butt, but pops right back up again.
KIDS

Whoa!/Wow!
YOUNG MIKE
Excuse me, fellas. How about we do

Mike is desperate to see.
between legs and sees:

He jumps up, ducks down, peeks

-a glimpse of a door being put into the door station.
-a glimpse of a door’s light glowing red.

7.
-a glimpse of a scarer warming up, snarling, etc.
MEAN KID
Did you see that?
KID #1
Look, he’s gonna do a real scare!
KIDS
(excited walla)
Whoa!
And then, Mike’s view is blocked completely.
(sigh)
Cool!

YOUNG MIKE

MEAN KID
I wanna be a scarer!

KID #2
Yeah, me too!
Mike gives it one more shot.
YOUNG MIKE
Come on guys, I wanna see!
MEAN KID
Out of the way, Wazowski, you don’t
belong on a scare floor.
KIDS
(walla)
Whoa! Cool!
Mike backs away as his smile fades.
Mike looks frustrated, not being able to see. Just then, a
cart full of scream cans comes toward Mike. He gets an idea.
ON TEACHER.
She tries to keep the kids together.
MRS. GRAVES
Brian, do not step over the line.
One of them points to the scare floor.
EMMET
Mrs. Graves? Michael went over the
line.

8.
Mrs. Graves’ eyes go wide.
MRS. GRAVES
(scream)
Michael?!
They all see Mike watching the MU scarer as he opens the door
to the human world and slinks inside. The door starts to
close behind him. But not before Mike, moving fast, slips
through the door and into the human world too!
INT. HUMAN KID’S ROOM - NIGHT
Inside the human kid’s room, Mike hides in the shadows as the
scarer starts his stealthy approach to the kid. The scarer
is totally unaware that Mike is in the room.
Mike’s terrified, but the more he watches the scarer, the
more he gets caught up in the excitement and awe of it all.
The scarer is about to scare when suddenly the kid’s bedroom
door opens and the parents peep in. Mike is hiding right
behind the door, inches away from the humans!
The scarer hides too, blending into the shadows.
MOM
See, I told you he’s fine.
DAD
Well, I thought I heard something.
The parents close the door and the scarer re-emerges,
continuing to build his scare.
Mike watches the scarer scratch the end of the bed.
The kid hears this and rises up in bed. The scarer slides
under the side of the bed and then looms up over the kid.
SCREAM!
ON MIKE as he watches.

His mouth falls open, in awe.

INT. SCARE FLOOR - CONTINUOUS
The scream can fills to the top.
The MU scarer steps through the door, a satisfied look on his
face - a solid scare. The door shuts down.

9.
And then he stops in his tracks when he realizes there are
dozens of people staring at him, panicked.
What?

MU SCARER

The MU scarer steps aside, revealing Mike smiling, a dazed,
dreamy look in his eye.
Mike is swarmed by angry people - his teacher, factory
employees, etc.
CROWD
What were you thinking?!
(walla)
This is ridiculous, young man! You
coulda got yourself killed, kid!
Did you touch anything?! Do you
know what could have happened?!
Meanwhile, as the scarer who was in the room with Mike dons
his MU hat, someone comes over and confers with him. The
scarer looks over at Mike, putting things together.
As the angry walla continues, the MU scarer approaches Mike
again, sternly. Mike is still in awe of everything he just
saw.
MU SCARER
That was real dangerous, kid. I
didn’t even know you were in there.
Mike looks at the scarer, ashamed.
And then, the scarer can’t help but smile, realizing
something.
MU SCARER (CONT’D)
(impressed)
Wow, I didn’t even know you were in
there....
(laugh)
Not bad, kid.
He winks and slaps his MU hat on Mike, then crosses away.
MRS. GRAVES
Michael, what do you have to say
for yourself?
Mike smiles the biggest, happiest smile you’ve ever seen.
YOUNG MIKE
How do I become a scarer?

Push in to a CU of the MU logo.
The eye in the “M” looks from right to left and Mike pops up
from behind it.

Well everyone, I don’t mean to get
emotional but everything in my life

dreams. Gladys, promise me you’ll

No response from the bus crowd.

I’m welling up with tears, now get

Unphased, Mike exits the bus.
EXT. BUS
Mike leaps down the stairs and gathers his bags.
He stares up in awe....
REVEAL MONSTERS UNIVERSITY: The gate, with the campus beyond.
EXT. CAMPUS
Mike walks onto a campus filled with monster students of all
shapes and sizes. In the background, the grand, classic
architecture of an Ivy League school.
Hello.

MIKE
How ya doing?

A student on a bicycle whooshes by.
Students play monster hackey sack in the quad as another
student with several arms posts signs to a lamppost.
A student on a skateboard whizzes by as a giant monster steps
over Mike and moves to catch a frisbee.

Ah!

Woo hoo!

FRISBEE MONSTER

MIKE
(excited laugh)
She catches the frisbee and sends it back to her friend.
CUT TO:
EXT. BRIDGE
Mike walks over a bridge on a small river. He looks down and
sees more students, swimming into what must be an underwater
section of the school.
Mike checks his list:
MIKE
Ok, first thing on my list... get
registered!
A monster in a “Smile Squad” shirt steps up to Mike.
JAY THE RA
Hey there, freshman! I’m Jay the
RA, and I’m here to say that
registration is that-a-way!
Okay Jay!

MIKE

Mike heads toward the registration area.
JAY THE RA
Have a great first day!
Mike steps up to the registration table.

card, the top of his head is the only part in the photo.
MIKE (CONT’D)

I can’t believe it...
(thrilled)
I’m officially a college student!!
He joins a freshmen tour group.
FAY
Okay everyone, I’m Fay and I’ll be
giving you your orientation tour on
this perfect day!
The TOUR GUIDE waves her flag.
Mike is in awe.
INT. SCHOOL OF DOOR TECHNOLOGY
The tour continues.
FAY
Here are the labs where students
learn to design and build the doors
to the human world.
We see a door being processed.
STUDENTS

Wow...
A Professor swipes their I.D. and enters the work area.
FAY
Looks like the professor’s about to
test a door.
A door is activated, and Mike catches a glimpse of a child’s
bedroom.

cafeteria.
FAY
The MU cafeteria serves a full
buffet, three meals a day. I
personally believe we have some of
the best chefs in the world.
We see a student dump food into a trash can. A food worker
then picks up the trash can and dumps it back onto the
buffet.

EXT. CAMPUS - MOMENTS LATER
FAY
The campus offers a wide variety of
majors but the crown jewel of MU is

The tour guide leads her tour away, leaving Mike alone in awe
of this famous building.
CUT TO:
EXT. QUAD - MOMENTS LATER
Mike passes by a series of tables, each one manned by
students trying to interest freshmen in their respective
clubs.
The Debate Team.

Mike continues to walk by the tables and an eye appears
behind him. He turns and he is eye to eye with another
monster.
EYE MONSTER
Hey there! Keep your eye on the
sky...at the astronomy club.
The Art Club.
A mop-looking monster splashes pink paint over his head,
covering himself. He then splatters his head on a canvas,
creating “art” while another member begins to play the drums.
The Improv Club.
IMPROV STUDENT
Hey, hey, hey! Come join the
Improv Club! You’ll wish you were

Mike passes by with a smile - he’s not interested, but loving
the variety of options, the huge world he’s entered.
GREEK COUNCIL table.
GREEK COUNCIL PRESIDENT
MU’s Greek Council.
Yet again, not for Mike.
Until, just as he passes by...
GREEK COUNCIL PRESIDENT (CONT’D)
We sponsor the annual Scare
Games....
That gets Mike’s attention.

He stops--

MIKE
(stumbling)
The Scare-what-now?
The Goth Greek Council president and the jock Greek Council
vice president pass Mike a flyer featuring the games.
GREEK COUNCIL VP
(explosive energy)
The Scare Games: a super-intense
scaring competition!

16.
GREEK COUNCIL PRESIDENT
(ominous, calm)
They’re crazy-dangerous, so
anything could happen.
GREEK COUNCIL VP
(explosive energy)
A bunch of guys went to the
hospital last year!
GREEK COUNCIL PRESIDENT
(ominous, calm)
You could totally die.
GREEK COUNCIL VP
(explosive energy)
And it’s worth it! You get a
chance to prove that you are the
best!
Mike stares down at the flyer, intrigued.
Cool.

INT. DORM HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
The RA hands Mike a key.
RA
Wazowski, room three nineteen; you
know your roommate is a scaring
major too.
Excited, Mike grabs his keys from the RA and excitedly heads
off toward his room.
MIKE
Hello, I’m your roommate. No,
that’s too bland.
(exhale)
Don’t force it. Just let it
happen. Your lifelong best friend
is right behind this door!
(deep breath)
Mike swings open the door and the monster in his room is...
RANDY BOGGS.
Randy is hidden in the shadows, then leaps forward with a
friendly hand outstretched.

17.
RANDY
Hey there! I’m your roomie.
Name’s Randy Boggs, scaring major!
MIKE
(small laugh)
Mike Wazowski, scaring major.
RANDY
I can tell we’re gonna be best
chums, Mike. Take whichever bed
you want - I wanted you to have
first dibs!
A student behind Randy drops some boxes.

Ah!

He disappears.

RANDY (CONT’D)
(startled voc)

Randy reappears.
MIKE
(gasp)
You just disappeared.
RANDY
Sorry.
(growing increasingly
agitated)
If I do that in scaring class, I’ll
be a joke!
MIKE
No, it’s totally great, you gotta
use it.
Really?

RANDY

MIKE
Yeah, but lose the glasses - they
give it away.
Mike heads into the room. Randy takes off his glasses and
squints, looking unintentionally evil.
RANDY
Huh....
(squinting voc)
Randy closes the door.

18.
INT. MIKE AND RANDY’S DORM ROOM
Mike finishes putting the last of his many scaring posters
up, placing books on a shelf, along with Little Mikey and
pinning up the Scare Games flyer.
He then consults his checklist.
MIKE
Okay, unpack - check. Hang posters
- check. Now I just need to ace my
classes, graduate with honors, and
become the greatest scarer ever.
RANDY
Boy, I wish I had your confidence,
Mike. Aren't you even a little
nervous?
MIKE
Actually, no. I’ve been waiting
for this my whole life.
Mike holds the MU hat he got from the scarer when he was a
kid. He walks toward the window.
MIKE (CONT’D)
I just can’t wait to get started.
We see the scare school in the distance.
EXT. SCARE SCHOOL - MORNING
The sun rises over the campus, as students make their way to
class.
GONG! The bells in the campanile sound the hour, signalling
the start of the day.
A slug student realizes he’s late.
SLUG
Oh man! I can’t be late on the
first day!
He pumps his arms furiously but doesn’t get very far.

19.
EXT. SCHOOL OF SCARING
Mike and Randy head into the School of Scaring with the other
students.
Students touch a statue as they pass by - an MU superstition.
Mike has to jump up a little to reach it, but he touches the
statue too.
INT. SCHOOL OF SCARING
Mike takes in the enormous rotunda-style classroom.
Wow.

MIKE

Busts of distinguished scare professors and alumni sit on
pedestals near the windows. In front of each one is a scream
can.
Mike takes a seat, much bigger monsters on either side of
him. A couple of them look down at Mike, amused.
BIG STUDENT #1
(chuckle)
BIG STUDENT #2
You gotta be kidding me....
Randy sits next to Mike.
RANDY
I’m so nervous....
MIKE
Relax, it’ll be fine.
A large, tough, drill sergeant monster, PROFESSOR KNIGHT,
addresses the class.
PROFESSOR KNIGHT
Good morning students, welcome to
scaring 101, I am Professor Knight!
Now, I’m sure all of you were the
scariest monster in your town, well
bad news kids, you’re in my town
now, and I do not scare easily--(short scream)
Suddenly a beam of light falls over Professor Knight.
STUDENTS

He stops and looks up to a now empty window. A shape flies
around the room, closing the curtains and lands with a
clatter behind him.

Dean Hardscrabble. This is a
pleasant surprise.
ON Mike watching Hardscrabble heading across the room, her
chilling insect legs tapping against the floor. Mike’s smile
brightens.
MIKE

She’s a legend; she broke the all
time scare record with the scream
in that very can.
ON HARDSCRABBLE.
She adjusts her scream can slightly.
HARDSCRABBLE
I don’t mean to interrupt, I just
thought I’d drop by to see the
“terrifying” faces joining my
program.
STUDENTS

PROFESSOR KNIGHT
Well, I’m sure my students would
love to hear a few words of
inspiration.
HARDSCRABBLE
(addressing Knight)
Inspiration? Very well.
She addresses the class.
HARDSCRABBLE (CONT’D)
Scariness is the true measure of a
monster.

HARDSCRABBLE (CONT’D)
If you’re not scary, what kind of
monster are you? It’s my job to
make great students greater, not
make mediocre students LESS
mediocre.
The class remains nervous.
HARDSCRABBLE (CONT’D)
That is why at the end of the
semester there will be a final
exam. Fail that exam, and you are
out of the scaring program.
The class reacts.
STUDENTS

What?
ON MIKE, he looks nervous.

A booming roar stops Mike mid-sentence, blowing everyone in
the room away.

class, late.
SULLEY (CONT’D)
Whoops, sorry. I heard someone say
roar, so I just kinda went for it.

Sulley starts to slide down the row of students, trying not
to squish people as he goes by.
SULLEY

Whoops, excuse me, sorry... didn’t

He’s a Sullivan....
PROFESSOR KNIGHT
I should’ve known. I expect big

Sulley reaches his seat and looks back to the professor
confidently.

23.
SULLEY
Well, you won’t be disappointed.
Mike interrupts.
MIKE
Uh, I’m sorry, should I keep going?
PROFESSOR KNIGHT
No, no, Mr. Sullivan’s covered it.
Sulley shoots two finger pistols at the Professor.
PROFESSOR KNIGHT (CONT’D)
(laugh)
Everyone take out your scaring
textbooks and open them to chapter
one....
Mike sits down, his moment stolen.
SULLEY
Hey bub. Could I borrow a pencil?
I forgot all my stuff.
A student hands Sulley a pencil.
SULLEY (CONT’D)
(picking his teeth)
Yeah, there we go...that’ll get it.
Mike is annoyed.
INT. MIKE AND RANDY’S ROOM
Mike pins up his calendar, covering the Scare Games flyer.
RANDY
Come on Mike- it’s a fraternity and
sorority party. We have to go!
Mike flips to December and marks the date for the scaring
final.
MIKE
We flunk that scaring final, we are
done. I’m not taking any chances.
Mike goes back to September and crosses out the first day of
school.

24.
RANDY
We’ve got the whole semester to
study, but this might be our only
chance to get in good with the cool
kids. That’s why I made these
cupcakes.
Randy holds up cupcakes that say spell out “BE MY dAL.”
Randy notices the mistake then turns the cupcake to read
“PAL."
RANDY (CONT’D)
Oops. That could have been
embarrassing.
Mike is too excited about studying to party.
MIKE
When I’m a scarer, life will be a
nonstop party. Stay outta trouble,
wild man!
Randy giggles and heads out, closing the door behind him.
RANDY
(giggling)
Wild man...
Mike laughs to himself.
He gets to work, opening his scaring book.
A strange noise draws his attention to the window. He looks
back to the window when a strange pig-faced monster animal
suddenly pops up and stares him in the face.
What the-?

MIKE

Suddenly the pig is pushed through the window and into Mike’s
room.
Ah!

MIKE (CONT’D)

The pig starts running all over the room. Then a big blue
hand rises into view and grabs the windowsill.

Sulley kneels down trying to grab Archie from under the bed.

MIKE
No, no, ah....

SULLEY

Sulley lifts the bed with one hand and shoves Mike under with
the other.
The bed bumps and bucks as Archie and Mike struggle
underneath.
SULLEY (CONT’D)
Don’t let go! Careful, he’s a
biter!
A CHOMP sound.
MIKE
(pained)
Ahhh!
Suddenly Archie darts from under the bed, yanking a battered
Mike behind him.
Archie jumps on Sulley and runs all over him.
Sulley falls as Archie leaps to the bookcase.
Sulley climbs Mike’s bookshelf to get Archie.
I got 'em.

Listen, it was quite delightful
meeting you and whatever that is,
but if you don’t mind I have to
study my scaring!
SULLEY
Pssh, you don’t need to study
scaring, you just do it.
MIKE
Really? I think there’s a little
more to it than that. But hey,
thanks for stopping by--Archie jumps down off the desk with Mike’s “MU” hat in his
mouth.

Sulley puts Mike down and the crowd surrounds them,
congratulating them. Mike grabs his hat. Sulley hands the
pig to a group of students who slap a “MU” sticker over his
Fear Tech saddle.
For Mike, who was annoyed to be on this wild pig chase, the
adulation of the crowd changes things. He soaks it up,
happily surprised.

Mike notices they’re fighting over Sulley, when suddenly a
voice calls out.
JOHNNY O.S.
I’ll take it from here, gentlemen!
Everyone turns to see a huge monster with large horns and a
protruding lower jaw flanked with terrifying fangs: JOHNNY.
He steps forward parting the crowd. Johnny and his gang wear
letterman jackets that read “ROR.”

JOHNNY

Chet, calm down.
CHET
(cowering)
I’m sorry.
JOHNNY
Sulley, any freshman with the guts
to pull off a stunt like that has
got “future scarer” written all
over him.
Sulley’s swept toward the ROR house, following after Johnny,
and the ROR brothers. Mike follows after him.
MIKE

in)
Hey, did you see me ride the pig,
that took guts....
Mike is stopped by one of Johnny’s thugs.

Johnny leans down to Mike’s level.

JOHNNY
Oh, sorry Killer, but you might

Mike is stunned.

He can’t be serious.

Johnny stops, annoyed.

Johnny looks to Sulley with a pained smile.
Sulley looks back and forth between the cool RORs and Mike.

Sulley looks surprised, and a little embarrassed to be called
out in front of the RORs, but he laughs it off.
SULLEY

Okay, I’d like to see that.
MIKE
Oh don’t worry...

Suddenly a huge, dark figure lands in front of them, wings

SULLEY
I don’t need to know any of that

That "stuff" would have informed
you that this particular child is
afraid of snakes. So a roar
wouldn’t make him scream, it would
make him cry, alerting his parents,
exposing the monster world,
destroying life as we know it, and
of course, we can’t have that, so
I’m afraid I can not recommend that
you continue in the scaring
program, good day.
SULLEY

Wait, what? But I’m a Sullivan.
HARDSCRABBLE

Well then, I’m sure your family

Sulley is incredulous, confused. He looks up into the
stands, just in time to see the door swing shut on Johnny and
the RORs as they exit.
Sulley can’t believe this is happening.
He turns to Mike and stares at him with pure hate and then
marches off.

heart breaks.
He looks down at his lame scream can tech book. His
frustration boils and he throws the book against the wall.
The book knocks down his calendar revealing the Scare Games

his face. He quickly tears the poster off the wall.

Mike points, revealing the members of the misfit fraternity:
Don, Terri and Terry, Squishy, and Art. They’re not used to
having so many eyes on them, but they stand proud.
Hi.

A balloon deflates on Squishy’s head.

The crowd snickers.

Hardscrabble approaches Mike.
HARDSCRABBLE
Mr. Wazowski, what are you doing?
MIKE
You just said the winners are the

program, but if you lose, you will
leave Monsters University.
Mike struggles with this and then...
Deal.

MIKE

HARDSCRABBLE
(smiling)
Now all you need to do is find
enough members to compete.
Mike turns to the misfits.
MIKE
We need six guys, right?
GREEK COUNCIL VP
Sorry chief, we count bodies, not
heads.
(pointing to Terri and
Terry)
That dude counts as one.
Terri and Terry look at each other.
Mike’s in a panic.
MIKE
(frantic)
Anybody else wanna join our team?!
Anyone at all?
RANDY
Excuse me. Sorry, I’m late.

Mike suddenly spots Randy in the crowd.
MIKE
Randy! Randy, thank goodness, I
need you on my team!

Oh sorry, I’m already on a team.
Johnny calls over, annoyed.

Randy looks conflicted, nervous.

He reveals his fraternity

RANDY

Mike, DON’T blow this for me!
He crosses to stand near the RORs.
JOHNNY
Do the thing.
With a pained smile - Randy’s thrilled to be a ROR, but isn’t
exactly one of the guys - Randy camouflages. Pleased, Johnny
chuckles.
CHET
(mock surprise)
Oh, where did he go?
(laughing)
ROR BROTHERS

MIKE
Please anybody! I need one more
monster. Just one more!
ON PRESIDENT.
GREEK COUNCIL PRESIDENT
(to Mike)
Yeah sorry, doesn’t look good. We
have to move on. Your team doesn’t
qualify.
SULLEY
Yes it does.
Sulley climbs on the car that Mike is standing on.
SULLEY (CONT’D)
The star player has just arrived.
Mike’s eye goes wide.

54.
MIKE
No way!
(to the crowd)
Someone else, please anyone else!
GREEK COUNCIL PRESIDENT
We’re shutting down sign-ups, okay.
Is he on your team or not?
Sulley smiles at Mike, cocky.
CROWD MEMBER
Come on, let’s go!
MIKE
(steaming)
Fine! Yes, he’s on my team.
Hardscrabble smiles a chilling smile.
Good luck.

HARDSCRABBLE

Hardscrabble walks off.
SULLEY
Alright Wazowski, what’s the plan?
EXT. OOZMA KAPPA FRATERNITY HOUSE
REVEAL: OOZMA KAPPA FRATERNITY HOUSE, a quaint little house.
ON Sulley and Mike looking confused by this place.
SULLEY
This is a fraternity house?
The door swings open, revealing DON CARLTON.
DON
Hey there, teammateys! Come on
aboard!
INT. OOZMA KAPPA FRATERNITY HOUSE.
Don ushers Sulley and Mike inside.

55.
DON
As the president of Oozma Kappa, it
is my honor to welcome you to your
new home!
Mike and Sulley step inside a very underwhelming house, where
they find their new fraternity brothers waiting.
SQUISHY
We call this room, “Party Central.”
It looks like an old lady’s house.
TERRY
Technically, we haven’t actually
had a party here yet.
TERRI
But when we do, we’ll be ready.
Terri presses a remote and a disco ball drops from the
ceiling on a cord. The cord snaps and the disco ball smashes
onto the floor.
INT. OOZMA KAPPA LIVING ROOM
Everyone is mingling.
DON
Whoo! Hot cocoa train is coming
through. Whoa...next stop...You!
Don hands Mike a drink.
Mike begins to address the room.
MIKE
I would like to start us off first
by SULLEY
(interrupting)
So...you guys are scaring majors?
Sulley stands near a cabinet looking at the dainty “old lady”
objects.
DON
(laugh)
We were. None of us lasted very
long. I guess we just weren’t what
old Hardscrabble was looking for.

56.
DON (CONT'D)
(hands Sulley a business
card)
...Don Carlton, “mature” student.
Thirty years in the textile
industry and then ol’ dandy Don got
downsized. Figured I could throw
myself a pity party or go back to
school and learn the computers.
Mike and Sulley turn to the cheery two-headed monster.
TERRY
Hello, I’m Terry with a Y!
TERRI
And I’m Terri with an I.

And I’m not.
TERRI

And turn....why didn’t you turn?
TERRY
(lowered voice)
Because we never agreed to do this.
TERRI
You said this was gonna be cool.
TERRY
No one said this was gonna be cool.
TERRI
Now I’m embarrassed.
TERRY
NOW you’re embarrassed?
TERRI
Yes, because it’s in front of
people.
TERRY
You should wake up embarrassed!
Next, it’s Art’s turn - big, burly, but with a sensitive side.
ART
(gruff)
Hey! I’m Art. New Age Philosophy
major.

57.
ART (CONT'D)
Excited to live with you, and laugh
with you, and cry with you.
He hands them each a journal.
ART (CONT’D)
Thought you might like to keep a
dream journal.
Suddenly, Squishy pops up right behind Sulley.
SQUISHY
Guess that leaves me.
Squishy gives Sulley a start - where did that little guy come
from? Squishy walks around in front of Sulley and takes a
seat.
SQUISHY (CONT’D)
My name’s Scott Squibbles. My
friends call me “Squishy.” I’m
undeclared, unattached and...
(losing steam)
...unwelcome pretty much
everywhere but here.
Mike tries to take control again.
MIKE
Well, now that we’ve all been
introduced, as captain of our teamSULLEY
(interrupting again)
So basically you guys have no
scaring experience?
MISFITS
(laughing)
SQUISHY
(chuckling)
Not a lot! But now we’ve got you!
DON
You’re about the scariest feller
I’ve ever seen - even with them
pink polka dots.
SULLEY
(blushing, laughing)
Aw, thanks.

58.
MIKE
Well actually, I think I bring the
whole package-Squishy grabs Sulley’s hand and holds it up to his face.
SQUISHY
Your hands are as big as my face!
TERRI
He’s like a mountain, with fur!
SULLEY
(Awe shucks)
Awe come on, I don’t even work out!
ART
Yeah, me neither.
(to Mike)
I don’t wanna get too big.
(sniff)
DON
(laughing)
We thought our dreams were over,
but Mike said if we win, they’re
letting us in the scaring program!
TERRI/TERRY
We’re gonna be real scarers!
MISFITS
The best!/Yeah, we are!/You betcha!
ON MIKE AND SULLEY as Sulley gives a confused, awkward
humoring nod.
SULLEY
(humoring nod)
Yeah, right...
Sulley looks over to Mike and shoots him a suspicious look.
Mike just smiles and nods.
CUT TO:
INT. MIKE AND SULLEY’S FRATERNITY ROOM
The guys enter a dark room, where Don flips a switch to turn
on the light.

59.
DON
And here’s what you’ve been waitin’
for, fellas, your very own Oozma
Kappa bedroom.
It’s a very small room with bunk beds.
SULLEY
(chuckling, incredulous,
as in “this should be
interesting”)
Ah great, we’re sharing this room?
DON
We’ll let you guys get settled.
Anything you need, you just give a
big holleroony!
Don shuts the door, leaving Mike and Sulley alone in the room
together.
SULLEY
Okay, thanks buddy...
(quickly to Mike)
Are you kidding me?
MIKE
Look, they don’t need to be good.
I’m gonna carry the whole team.
Really?

SULLEY
And who’s gonna carry you?

Mike stares at Sulley, furious.

Hey, you wanna go back to can

A ROBED MONSTER (Don) suddenly steps from the shadows.

basement in light.
A middle-aged monster mom comes down the
stairs carrying a basket of laundry.
MISFITS
(bright light reaction)
Whoa!/Hey, for crying out loud.

61.
MS. SQUIBBLES
Sweetie, turn the lights on while
you’re down here. You’re going to
ruin your eyes.
SQUISHY
Mom, we’re doing an initiation!
MS. SQUIBBLES
Oh scary! Well, carry on, just
pretend I’m not here.
SQUISHY
This is my mom’s house.
Squishy tries to pretend she’s not there.
SQUISHY (CONT’D)
Do you promise to look out for your
brothers, no matter what the
peril....
Ms. Squibbles goes about her business, turning on both the
washer and the dryer. The noise gets much louder.
SQUISHY (CONT’D)
(louder)
...will you defend Oozma Kappa, no
matter how dangerous, no matter how
insurmountable the odds may be?
From evils - both great and small in the face of unending pain and-(then, giving up)
Oh, forget it. You’re in.
The brothers of Oozma Kappa crowd around Mike and Sulley.
DON
Look, we know we’re no one’s first
choice for a fraternity. So it
means a lot to have you here with
us.
SQUISHY
Can’t wait to start scaring with
you, brothers!
Squishy offers them each an Oozma Kappa baseball hat.
Mike puts it on then looks to Sulley - is he in or out? A
beat, then Sulley reluctantly puts on the hat. It’s way
small for his giant head.
The fraternity brothers cheer!

62.
Terry whacks Sulley on the butt again with the paddle.
Sulley snatches the paddle away and snaps it in half.
and Terry scurry away.

Terri

The misfits head off.
SQUISHY (CONT’D)
Time for a celebration! Grab the
couch cushions, gentlemen, cuz
we’re building a fort!
MISFITS
(cheering walla)
Yeah!
Mom!

SQUISHY
Can we stay up late tonight?!

INT. OOZMA KAPPA, MIKE AND SULLEY’S ROOM - MORNING
The sun is just coming up as Mike sleeps in bed. He rolls
over, right into a blue furry hand. He cuddles into the hand
for a beat.
PANNING WIDE we see that Sulley’s arm is flopped out of his
top bunk. It’s so long it reaches down onto Mike’s bed.
MIKE
(snoring, murmuring)
I know you’re a princess and I’m
just a stable boyMike cuddles TENDERLY with the hand for another moment, then
the alarm goes off. His eye opens, and he sees Sulley’s
hand.
MIKE (CONT’D)
(cuddling noises, then)
ACCHHHH!
He pushes the hand away, flipping a sleeping Sulley out of
the top bunk. BAM! Sulley lands on the floor, then pops up
angrily.
SULLEY
(impact effort)
What?! Mom!
(looking to Mike)
What are you doing?!

63.
MIKE
Your grubby paw was in my bed!
SULLEY
(flustered)
Were you kissing my hand?
MIKE
(big laugh)
No! And what about you with all
your shedding!
SULLEY
I don’t shed.
Really?

MIKE

Mike punches the bottom of Sulley’s mattress, and blue hair
comes cascading down off the mattress.
Sulley tries pushing past Mike, as Mike gets out of bed.
Mike tries to go around Sulley.
Excuse me-

MIKE (CONT’D)

SULLEY
(growl)
I just wanna get my stuffSULLEY
MIKE
(pushing efforts)
Would you...just...let me get
Ow...hey, come on..oof!
my stuff! Ahhh, ow!
They fall out of their bedroom door. Flash! They find all
the misfits gathered there in the hallway, smiling at them.
SQUISHY
First morning in the house!
ART
That’s going in the album.
Don runs up the stairs out of breath.
Guys!

DON
We got...a letter!

A letter?

SQUISHY
Really?

TERRI
We never get mail.

64.
Mike, Sulley, and the misfits gather around. Don hands Mike
the letter, Mike tries to take it from Don, but it’s stuck to
his tentacles.
DON
(letter sticking to
tentacles vocs)
Oh sorry, it’s stuck....
MIKE
(grabbing the letter)
Would you, gimme that!
Mike finally pulls it off of Don and reads it.
DON
Tentacles...
(laugh)
They’re sticky...
Mike opens the envelope revealing a mysterious letter.
MIKE
(gasp)
It’s the first event of the Scare
Games!
MISFITS
(walla)
Cool!/Alright!
MIKE
“A child’s room is where you scare,
but avoid the toxicity lurking
there.”
SULLEY
Wait a minute, where do they want
us to meet?
INT. SEWER/DRAIN SYSTEM, ON CAMPUS - NIGHT
Mike, Sulley, and the misfits tentatively step into the
sewer/drain located on campus. Water drips, graffiti on the
wall, spooky.
ART
Of all the sewers on campus this
one has always been my favorite.

65.
TERRY
Art, you've been here before?
ART
I have a life outside of the house,
you know!
As they step forward and turn a corner, they hear voices...
and then they see:
The assembled throng for the first event of the Scare Games.
The Greek Council president and VP stand in the center of the
sewer, on a stage against a wall.
All the competing fraternities and sororities are there,
gathered around the stage.
GREEK COUNCIL VP
Welcome to your worst nightmare,
THE SCARE GAMES!
(enjoying the excitement)
Yeees, yes, I love it! I love this
energy! Okay, okay everybody!
Mike glances up, noticing Hardscrabble peering in from on
high.

GREEK COUNCIL VP
And finally... Oozma Kappa...
ON THE OOZMAS. The guys look small and pathetic. The crowd
goes silent, a lone cheer accompanies the group. Mike looks
over to see Ms. Squibbles calling down from a sewer grate.
YAY!

MS. SQUIBBLES
Woohoo!

Hi Mom!
Smile!

SQUISHY
MS. SQUIBBLES

She snaps a picture.
Back on the Oozmas, Mike sighs.
GREEK COUNCIL VP
Let’s begin the first competition:
the toxicity challenge!
GREEK COUNCIL PRESIDENT
Human children are TOXIC!
She makes her way across the stage now to point to a drawing
of children’s toys.
GREEK COUNCIL PRESIDENT (CONT’D)
And anything they touch is toxic.
GREEK COUNCIL VP
We don’t have any human toys but
thanks to MU’s biology department,
we’ve found a close second. The
stinging glow urchin!
Some students bring in a crate stamped with the words “MU
BIOLOGY DEPT.” The president reaches into the crate with a
metal claw and pulls out a beautiful, glowing, spikey orb.

67.
The crowd recoils in fear.
The urchin glows and sparks menacingly.
GREEK COUNCIL VP (CONT’D)
(to the crowd)
Trust me when I say you are not
gonna wanna touch this bad boy!
ON Art in the crowd.
ART
I wanna touch it.

GREEK COUNCIL PRESIDENT
And you certainly don’t wanna touch
any of its friends.
REVEAL an entrance to a tunnel... which is filled with
hundreds of the toxic glow urchins scattered along the floor.
The crowd is terrified.
ON Art.
ART
Yeah, I wanna touch ‘em.
ON VP.
GREEK COUNCIL VP
(pointing to the tunnel)
This is the starting line. The
light at the end of the tunnel is
the finish line.
GREEK COUNCIL PRESIDENT
And whoever comes in last is
eliminated from the games.
Mike?

Mike jumps.
Ah!

Alright, alright, that’s very cute

ON Mike as he glares at Sulley and readies himself at the
starting line.

We see the fraternities and sororities lined up along the
starting line of the Scare Games course.

This is all about teamwork.

The misfits stand in the background, behind Mike and Sulley.
MIKE
I’m gonna beat you over that finish
line!
SULLEY
Get ready to eat my dust!
SQUISHY
Hey guys, should we huddle up?
ON president and VP.
GREEK COUNCIL PRESIDENT
Attention teams, one last thing.
Scarers work in the dark.
With that, the floodlight is shut down, leaving the course
entirely dark. In the darkness, the glow urchins become
infinitely more terrifying, glowing and sparking dangerously.
SQUISHY
(scared)
I wanna go home.
GREEK COUNCIL VP
On your marks!
Squishy, Terri and Terry turn to the PNKs finishing their
huddle.
TERRY

Hey, good luck ladies.

Thanks, we’re gonna rip you to
pieces!

The PNK SISTERS shoot the misfits an evil look.

Mike and Sulley glare at each other one last time.

GO!!

GREEK COUNCIL VP (CONT’D)

THE RACE BEGINS!
ART runs off, the Oozmas and all the other teams follow
behind Art who leads the charge with a war cry!
ART
I’m gonna TOUCH ’EM!
He immediately hits a bunch of the glow urchins, which
illuminate, shocking him. He comes crashing down and looks
over at his leg, which immediately balloons right up.
ART (CONT’D)
(vocs getting hit &
falling, then laughing)
AH! WHOA! Ah!
(ballooning up)
AAAAAAH!
The crowd goes crazy.
The teams are off! Mike and Sulley carefully start
navigating the danger, ignoring the misfits.
The EEK sisters are right behind the guys and one of them
steps on an urchin.

then collapses.

Oh shocker, Oozma Kappa has been

Attention everyone! We have an
announcement! Jaws Theta Chi has

MIKE
This is gonna be harder than I
thought.
The Oozma Kappa name is put back on the scoreboard.
EXT. QUAD
Mike has gathered the team together on the quad. He passes
before them like a drill sergeant as Sulley leans against the
tree behind him.
MIKE
Okay, listen up Oozmas! Now we’re
gonna have to start winning these
things together, so that means I’m
gonna need each of you guys to pull
your own weight.
Squishy appears behind Mike.
Mike.

SQUISHY

Ah!

MIKE
What is it?

SQUISHY
We’ve made a list of our strengths
and weaknesses.
DON
In high school I was the master of
the “silent scare.” Why I could
sneak up on a field mouse in a
pillow factory.
Don delicately creeps along the ground on his hands and
knees, but his tentacles stick to the sidewalk. He awkwardly
pulls them up each with a loud, grating, popping sound.
DON (CONT’D)
(struggling)
Sorry, they get stickier when I’m
sweaty.
(keeps walking)
Oh my gosh, that’s terrible. Wait,
no, no...
Mike just stares at him....
Terry pulls out playing cards and begins to do a card trick.
TERRY
We’re experts in the ancient craft
of close-up magic.
TERRI
(mysterious)
It’s all about misdirection.
Cards spill out of Terri’s sleeve and Terry sighs,
embarrassed.
ART
I have an extra toe.
(laughing, sotto)
Not with me of course.
Mike calls out to quiet the team.
MIKE
Guys, one slipup in the next event
and we’re goners. So for this to
work, I’m gonna need you to take
every instinct you have and bury it
deep, deep down.

77.
Mike crumples up their list and throws it away.
Done.

ART

MIKE
From now on we are of one mind, my
mind.
Sulley rolls his eyes.
Oh please.

I will tell you exactly what to do
and how to do it.
MISFITS

Okay Mike./That seems about
right./Sure.
MIKE
Alright, give me scary steps!
Fifty, up and down. Right now,
let’s go!
Sulley walks over to Mike.
SULLEY
You’re wasting your time...we need
a new team.
MIKE
(mocking)
We can't just get a new team. I
checked this morning, it's against

able to continue down that path.

One of the RORs hides in a plant while Randy slinks up a lamp
shade, disappearing completely.
A referee with several eyes sneaks around with a flashlight
trying to find competitors. The flashlight lands on a
curtain. It’s pulled back to reveal a HSS sorority sister.
The referee blows the whistle.
REFEREE
You’re out!
The referee hears a rattle and catches a one-eyed monster
holding up an end table.
REFEREE (CONT’D)
You’re out!
The light finds the fireplace where debris falls down the
chute. Another HSS sister falls and lands in the soot.
REFEREE (CONT’D)
Yeah, yeah, tough luck, Kris
Kringle.
She walks off frustrated. The referee follows and completely
misses Sulley who disguises himself as a bear rug.

Sulley stands up and runs off. Mike turns around from inside
a globe holder and we pan up and see Don attached to the

Thanks for coming, Dean.
Sulley follows the dean and then humbly addresses her.

SULLEY
Dean Hardscrabble? If we get back
into the scaring program, I hope
there’s no hard feelings?
She stops and turns to Sulley.
HARDSCRABBLE
Tomorrow each of you must prove
that you are undeniably scary. And
I know for a fact, that one of you
is not.
Hardscrabble looks over at the team, she lands on Mike.
Sulley’s eyes follow.
MIKE
(effort sounds)
It’s as simple as that.
SULLEY
No, he works harder than anyone.
HARDSCRABBLE
Do you think he’s scary?
SULLEY
He’s the heart and soul of the

DO YOU think he’s scary?

Mike playfully throws his hands in the air toward the sim kid
--to his shock the sim kid shoots out of bed and lets out a
terrifying scream, reacting just as wildly as it did in the

Mike leaps back in shock.
Mike turns to see the can fill all the way to the top.

But Mike approaches the bed slowly, his smile fading. Mike
leans in and snaps his fingers right by the sim kid’s head.
The dummy shoots back into the air and screams.
Confused, Mike lifts the bed skirt to reveal a control panel.

“Medium,” and “Hard.”

And just like that, Sulley’s said it. And Mike is thrown for
a second. Then his eye narrows, and he storms off.
As he does, REVEAL the misfits, who are standing just off the

Mike hears a COUGH offscreen.

The camera pulls out to reveal he’s in a cabin full of beds,

We’ve got a call in, but that’s the

bewildered to see someone has crossed into the lab.
DON
Ahem.

Don Carton, sales. Folks, today is
your lucky day, how many times have
you asked yourself the following

Ahhh!

DON
Do you mind?!

Don’t move!
Sulley runs for the door.
When Sulley’s almost to the door, Hardscrabble spots him out
of the corner of her eye.
What?

HARDSCRABBLE
Sullivan! Don't you dare!

He grabs the door handle....
HARDSCRABBLE (CONT’D)
Sullivan, don’t go in there!
Sulley quickly looks back toward Hardscrabble, ignores her
and slips through the door.
INT. CAMP TEAMWORK - NIGHT
Sulley creeps through the cabin, which is empty.
Mike?

SULLEY
(whisper)
Mike? Mike?
Sulley hears voices outside and crosses to a window. Some
camp counselors are gathered in front of one of the kids’
cabins, relating the events of the night to some park
rangers. The flashing lights of the ranger’s cruiser strobe
through the cabin.

The kids are saying they saw
something in the cabin.

They’re calling it an alien.

Sulley hears a noise and looks over to see a broken screen.
He goes to the screen and whispers outside....

Sulley jumps down from the window.
A couple of rangers hear him and train their flashlights on
him.

Ah!

Bear!

SULLEY

RANGER
A bear in the camp!

Sulley takes off running, jumping down into a gully, evading
the lights.
Sulley sprints through the woods. He bursts through some
brush and comes to the edge of a lake.
He scans the lake but hears men yelling and ducks behind a
rack of canoes, seeing flashlights in the distance.
RANGERS

Down there, everybody over here...I
heard something over here.
Sulley hears a splash and turns to see Mike sitting at the
foot of the lake, staring at his reflection in the water.
SULLEY

Mike!
Mike doesn’t look back.

136.
SULLEY (CONT’D)
C’mon buddy, let’s get you out of
here.
Mike still doesn’t look up.
SULLEY (CONT’D)
This is all my fault...I’m sorry--Mike continues to look down.
MIKE
(depressed)
You were right, they weren’t scared
of me.
Sulley moves closer and looks down at Mike, silent.
MIKE (CONT’D)
I did everything right. I wanted
it more than anyone. And I
thought, I thought if I wanted it
enough, I could show everybody
that...
Mike stares at his reflection in the water.
MIKE (CONT’D)
That Mike Wazowski is something
special, and I’m just...not.
He splashes it away.
SULLEY
Look Mike, I know how you feel--MIKE
Don’t do that. Please don’t do
that. You DO NOT know how I feel.
Mike’s raises his voice, Sulley looks around cautiously.
SULLEY
Mike, calm down.
MIKE
Monsters like you have everything.
You don’t have to be good, you can
mess up over and over again, and
the whole world loves you.

SULLEY
Yeah, I’m a Sullivan! I’m the
Sullivan who flunked every test,
the one who got kicked out of the
program. The one who was so afraid
to let everyone down, that I
cheated, and I lied.
(sigh)
Mike, I’ll never know how you feel,
but you’re not the only failure
here.
Sulley’s shoulders drop, he sits down next to Mike.
SULLEY (CONT’D)
I act scary Mike, but most of the
time...I’m terrified.
MIKE
How come you never told me that
before?
SULLEY
Because...we weren’t friends
before.
Mike is stunned, at a loss for words.
Suddenly a flashlight grazes Sulley.
Sulley jumps back as the lights come toward him.
Mike hides behind a rock as he watches Sulley driven away.
Mike is in shock. Sulley looks back at Mike, they both don’t
know what to do. After a second, Sulley just takes off
running.

Sulley runs through the darkness and right into an

He tries to climb the slippery side of the embankment but the

Sulley looks up - it’s Mike, at the top of the embankment.
Sulley’s surprised....
In the distance, the sound of humans is getting closer, and

He pulls Sulley up over the edge.

Mike and Sulley are panicked. Mike closes the door, then
quickly opens it, but again, nothing.
Mike and Sulley hear the humans outside getting closer.
They run to the cabin window and see that a group of rangers
has arrived. They approach the cabin, shining flashlights.
Sulley runs away.
SULLEY
We’ve gotta get out of here.
Mike gets an idea.
MIKE
(whispered)
Let them come!

SULLEY

What?
Sulley looks at Mike, confused.
MIKE
If we scare them, I mean really
scare them...we could generate
enough scream to power the door

SULLEY
What are you talking about?!
MIKE
I have read every book about
scaring ever written. This could
work!
SULLEY
They’re ADULTS! I can’t do this!
MIKE
Yes you can, just follow my lead.
CUT TO:
ON THE DOOR to the cabin. The doorknob turns, then rangers
pour in, flashlights pointing into the darkness.
They jump as a fan turns on suddenly, then slows to a stop.
The window drapes flutter, as if someone has just touched
them.
The rangers proceed farther into the cabin.
Up in the rafters, Sulley and Mike nod at each other. Mike
counts down silently as they get ready for their next action.
BAM! The front door of the cabin slams shut behind the
rangers.
The rangers hear music. They spin around and see a record
player, playing a record backward.
They hear another sound and turn their flashlights on a doll
walking across the cabin.
Ma-ma.

DOLL
Ma-ma.

The doll walks into a bed post and falls down.

DOLL (CONT’D)

Ma-ma. Ma-ma...
They see a dark shadow run across the floor behind them.
It’s Mike.
Sulley reaches down behind the rangers and scrapes the floor
with his claws. The rangers turn in time to see the claw
marks on the floor.
They hear something in the rafters. Shining their
flashlights in that direction they see more claw marks on the
walls all around them.
They hear a deep, low growl as something short and round
scurries across the floor.
SULLEY

Down on the floor, the rangers jump when suddenly the bunk

The terrified rangers run to avoid being hit by the beds,
which fall on the front door, blocking it.

He turns to Sulley.

Sulley looks uncertain.
RANGER #1
Call for backup!

Mike jumps down from the rafters behind the rangers. He
grabs a fishing pole and ties some of the line to a table
leg. He runs around the room, encircling the rangers.
RANGERS

What was it?/Let’s go!
The rangers are spooked.
From a hiding place behind a piece of furniture, Mike locks

Sulley drops from the rafters, landing in front of the
rangers. He begins to let out a deep growl....
As the rangers recoil in horror, Mike tightens the fishing
line around the ranger’s legs causing them to fall and get
tangled in the line.
As the rangers struggle on the floor, Sulley looms over them
and lets out a ferocious roar.

Sulley and Mike burst through it in a cloud of smoke and

They all look back at the door, which has been completely

SULLEY
Mike, I don’t know a single scarer
who can do what you do. I know
everyone sees us together, they
think I’m the one running the show,
but the truth is I’ve been riding
YOUR coattails since day one. You
made the deal with Hardscrabble,
you took a hopeless team and made
them champions. All I did was
catch a pig.
MIKE

Technically, I caught the pig.
SULLEY

EXACTLY! And you think you’re just
”okay”? You pulled off the biggest
scare this school has ever seen!

Mike’s never heard anyone say that before.

warming up to you.
Sulley looks down awkwardly.
SULLEY

Mike looks at the picture, smiles sheepishly.
HARDSCRABBLE (CONT’D)

I should keep an eye out for more
“surprises” like you in my program.
It’s good to hear, but a little late.
HARDSCRABBLE (CONT’D)
But as far as the two of you are
concerned, there is nothing I can
