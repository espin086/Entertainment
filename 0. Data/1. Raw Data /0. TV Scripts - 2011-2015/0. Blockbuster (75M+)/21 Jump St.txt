EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

SCHMIDT (a young, nerdy Jonah Hill) walks towards his High
School. He looks up and sees a big banner that reads “PROM IS
THIS WEEKEND: BUY YOUR TICKETS NOW!!!”
As he makes his way to the front entrance, we see him
avoiding the VARIOUS OTHER SOCIAL GROUPS. He is clearly
introvert and keeps his head low. A SUPER NERDY GUY walks up.

JENKO
Out of the way, tubby.

Jenko bumps Schmidt aside and pulls his gym clothes and
cleats out. Two of Jenko’s jock buddies walk up.
JENKO (CONT’D)
Yo, Terry! You ready to get some at
prom? I fucking am. Janet basically
told me if I get her a nice corsage
I can do anything I want to her.
JOCK
What are you gonna do?
JENKO
Let’s just say it involves my balls
and her tits.
JOCK
You’re gonna rub your balls on her
tits?
JENKO
Exactly. I’ve never done that.

Schmidt stares at Jenko, clearly jealous. Jenko notices, and
Schmidt looks away, to see a CUTE GIRL (MELODIE) walking
towards him. He immediately gets extremely nervous. He takes
a deep breath and steps out into the center of the hall,
abruptly blocking her path, causing her to bump into him.

Schmidt is absolutely crushed. He looks at Jenko, angry, then
back at Melodie, heart-broken, and then runs off. Jenko and
his buddies chuckle and start heading to gym class.

Jenko walks out the front door, upset. He punches the door,
denting it. He hears sniffling and turns to see Schmidt
sitting on the stairs, upset. The two make eye contact for an

They share another awkward look, both get up and part ways.

president, Juario. I’m Principal
Dadier, and unlike every other
adult you’ll meet in your young
lives, I am going to level with
you. I’m no different than you. I
mean, now you guys are young, but
you’ll be in your mid to late
twenties someday and you will look
around and be like where’s the

going to be you. It’s crazy.

This education thing is so much
more messed up than you could
possibly imagine. About a third of
my teachers are awful and they
can’t be fired. A kid died the
other day and nobody’s doing
anything, and now you guys show up
with like a month left of school
and cause trouble. If I have one
more thing go wrong, I just think
I’m going to basically lose it. I
will have a straight up breakdown.
