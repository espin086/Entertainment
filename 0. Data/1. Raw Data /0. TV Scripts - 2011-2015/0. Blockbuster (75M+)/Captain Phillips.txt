BLACK. The sound of waves. Then a dull THUD. We FADE IN:
...on a floating hell, images bending and flickering. Instead
of sounds, we just hear a thin ringing. We are:
1

1

INT. LIFEBOAT - NIGHT
An enclosed, fiberglass LIFEBOAT, 28 feet long, 40 seats,
HATCHES fore and aft. It's drifting on the Indian Ocean, 20
miles from Somalia.

RICHARD PHILLIPS lies on the floor, his hands bound. He's 50,
a career sailor, now a hostage, just took a terrible beating.
His captors are four Somali pirates: BILAL, 16, his left foot
wrapped in bloody gauze; NAJEE, 24, pointing his AK-47 at us.
ELMI, 25, is up front at the helm.
Their leader is MUSI, around 20, rail-thin, his hand bandaged
and bloody. He shouts into the RADIO; but we just hear that
thin ringing, until finally his words become clear:
MUSI (INTO LIFEBOAT RADIO)
Okay. We gonna kill the hostage
now. Need a bodybag over here.
He barks an order in Somali. Najee and Bilal pull an ORANGE
SURVIVAL SUIT from a bin, and spread it on the floor. Musi
loads a 9 mm. gun. MUSI (CONT’D)
I got the gun...Say goodbye! Out!
He tosses the radio, marches at Phillips, yanks him to his
feet, rage in his eyes. Game over. Phillips knows it.
PHILLIPS
I thought you were all just
fishermen.
The gun comes up. Musi and Phillips are eye to eye. We
TIGHTEN on Phillips, then SMASH TO BLACK, and:
Super: "Nine days earlier."
...when the world was still sane.
CUT TO:

INT. HALLWAY- PHILLIPS HOME - NIGHT
CU: Phillips, eyeing himself in a mirror.
He’s about to take his wife out to dinner, their ritual on
his last night before a trip. He looks relaxed, but there’s
something behind the eyes.

2

2.
Might just be that he’s a mariner on land, or maybe he can
see the sea miles on his face; it’s hard to say. From
downstairs he hears:
Honey?

ANDREA (O.S.)

That’s his wife. It’s time to go. He grabs a sealed bottle of
wine from a counter, carries it off. We CUT TO:
3

INT. RESTAURANT - ESSEX, VT. - NIGHT

3

Phillips and ANDREA, (Italian-American by birth, an
experienced nurse) sit by the window. This is the restaurant
they choose when they want the night to feel like a date.
ANDREA
(mid-story)
...biggest heart surgeon in the
state and he can’t remember to wash
his hands between patients. He also
never changes his tie. Ya know,
that’s how most staph infections
get bounced around hospitals.
Doctors’ neckties.
PHILLIPS
Must be why I never wear one.
She grins. Phillips pulls that bottle of wine from a paper
bag.
PHILLIPS (CONT’D)
Guy sounds like a jerk. What do the
other nurses say?
ANDREA
They wanna give him a foley
catheter.
Phillips breathes out a laugh, pours the wine.
ANDREA (CONT’D)
Been thinking, I might pick up some
double shifts. Might as well. Be
nice to have the extra, you know.
And with everyone away.
PHILLIPS
You don’t have to do that.
ANDREA
I’ll think about it anyway.
Phillips has a piece of paper, with a LIST on it. It’s
something he always does the night before shipping out...

3.
PHILLIPS
Can we do the list?
Sure.

ANDREA

PHILLIPS
I didn’t get to salting the
driveway outside the shed, and I
think the snowblower needs oil. Did
you see Mariah’s tuition came in?
ANDREA
I know. Dan’s too. Seven per cent?
Ugh.
PHILLIPS
And the dryer’s been rattling.
Needs a new thermal fuse or
something.
ANDREA
I’ll call the guy.
He puts the list down.
ANDREA (CONT’D)
Is that it?
That’s it.

PHILLIPS

His job done, he leans back... but he feels that twinge (he’s had a bad back for years). He shakes it off.
Andrea, of course, caught it.
ANDREA
You all set for this one?
PHILLIPS
Yeah, I’ll be fine.
He is who he is. We CUT TO:

EXT. DUNES - EYL, SOMALIA - MORNING
A convoy of 4x4s roars across the sand - towards a remote,
dilapidated compound by the sea.

6

EXT. PIRATE COMPOUND - DAY

6

At the edge of the compound a young boy sees them coming.
Starts running.
7

7

INT. COMPOUND HUT - EYL, SOMALIA - SAME

The young boy opens the door - kicks a sleeping figure on the
floor. This is Musi.
YOUNG BOY (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)
Quick! They’re coming!
Musi’s up, that fast - been dreading this moment for days.
8

EXT. COMPOUND STREET- EYL, SOMALIA - VARIOUS - DAY

8

Musi (a pirate, roughly 20) hurrying past hostage pens, a
brothel, a man with one hand, a goat sipping at a puddle and
young women selling bunches of KHAT LEAVES, the ubiquitous
drug chewed by most Somalis.
In the distance a glimpse of the ocean.
He turns a corner to find the 4X4’s and a pack of
BOSSES - all guns and sat phones - tearing into a
HUFAN (44) while a CROWD OF YOUNG SOMALI MEN, all
pirates, watch, including one of Musi’s age. This

PIRATE
guy named
aspiring
is Asad.

PIRATE BOSS #1 (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)
(to Hufan)
What is this bullshit? - you bring
me small ships. Now I have to feed
these hostages and no-one wants to
pay a ransom.
HUFAN (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)
The big ships sit too high in the
water.
PIRATE BOSS #1 (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)
Then get bigger ladders.
Hufan nods. The group starts to disperse.
HUFAN
Pick your crews. And do it fast.

5.
ASAD
(Turns to Musi)
Stay out of my way today, skinny
rat.
They move off towards the beach; followed by the young boy.

EXT. PHILLIPS HOME. EARLY MORNING

9

Revealing an average Vermont farm house.
10

INT. PHILLIPS HOME - BATHROOM SHOWER- EARLY MORNING

10

Angle on the half opened doors. Phillips showering. Radio in
the background - the economy.
11

INT. PHILLIPS BEDROOM- LATER

11

Phillips packs - a few paperbacks, passport, papers marked
“Maersk Line” showing a large container ship. And a 15lb bag
of 8 o'clock coffee beans. Last, a framed photo - of
Phillips, Andrea, their two KIDS, DAN AND MARIAH, taken ten
years ago. He was younger then...
Looks up - sees a glimpse of Andrea dressing for work. Just a
moment. Then:
PHILLIPS
Have you seen my dopp-kit?
ANDREA
Dan’s room, I think.
12

INT. PHILLIPS HOME - UPSTAIRS - MINUTES LATER

12

Phillips walks down the hall - pauses at a half-opened door.
His daughter MARIAH’s room. Every inch of wall space is
filled with posters, bumper stickers, equestrian ribbons.
They make him smile.
13

INT. PHILLIPS HOME - DAN’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

13

Phillips enters his son's room now. Lots of clutter, photos
of swimsuit models on the walls and one of him and his father
fishing when he was a boy - and the kid himself, just
awakening: DAN, 19.
DAN
I was just coming downstairs...
PHILLIPS
You got that dopp-kit?
DAN
Sure - it’s over there.
Phillips picks it up off the dresser.

6.
PHILLIPS
Thought you were driving back to
school this morning.
DAN
I decided to leave later.
PHILLIPS
Uh-huh. What time'd you get in last
night?
DAN
It wasn't late.
PHILLIPS
Had to be after midnight - 'cause I
was still up and you weren't here.
DAN
You really gonna interrogate me,
Dad?
PHILLIPS
It's really simple, Dan. You go to
school. That's your job. You're
either doing it or you're not.
DAN
You wanna boss people around? Do it
on the boat, okay? Jesus.
A blow-up, that fast. Silence hangs...
PHILLIPS
I’ll see you when I get back and
don’t forget to check in on your
mom while I'm gone.
DAN
I know the drill.
14

EXT. PHILLIPS HOME - DRIVEWAY - MOMENTS LATER

14

Andrea is getting into the car. Phillips walks past the old
NAUTICAL BELL that’s been sitting (forever) on a chair by the
door. He gets in beside her.
PHILLIPS
I didn’t get time to do that bell.
ANDREA
I’ll put it on the list.
Phillips looks up: there's Dan, glancing down from his
bedroom window.

7.
ANDREA (CONT’D)
He stayed in so he could see you
off this morning.
PHILLIPS
I don't like him to miss class.
A half-wave from Dan in the window. Phillips acknowledges
it... Then they drive off.
15

INT/EXT. CAR-UNDERHILL - VARIOUS - MORNING

15

Phillips and Andrea driving through Underhill - white picket
fences, the local store, a handmade sign for fresh eggs, St
Thomas' Church. No stop-lights.
Phillips watches it slip by and out into the Vermont fields
beyond.
16

INT. MINIVAN/EXT. BURLINGTON AIRPORT - CURB - MORNING

16

Airport. Andrea pulls up to the curb. Phillips pauses.
PHILLIPS
You’re not coming in?
ANDREA
I can't today. Had a shift change.
I’m late already.
Oh. Okay.

PHILLIPS
He lets it go, gets out. We STAY WITH ANDREA - as Phillips
grabs his stuff from the back of the minivan. Comes back
round: A quick hug. A quick kiss. Neither of them are big on
goodbyes.
ANDREA
I love you.
PHILLIPS
Call you when I get to port.
Then he’s on his way into the terminal and she’s gone. On
Phillips face as he looks back - that’s the first time ever
she’s not come in with him- we CUT TO:
17

EXT. PIRATE COMPOUND - BEACH - EYL, SOMALIA - DAY
Musi and Asad follow Hufan across the beach towards two
skiffs down by the ocean.
Young men approach, anxious for work.
ASAD CREW 1 (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)
Hey - take me today, brother?

17

8.
ASAD (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)
(rubs his fingers
together)
What you gonna give me?
A few begin to dig into their pockets. Musi sees this, then
spots BILAL, clearly younger than the others.
MUSI (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)
Your sister know you’re here?
BILAL (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)
(points back to one of the
GIRLS selling khat)
Sure. She give me good leaves.
Bilal shows Musi his stash of khat leaves. Musi takes some
and chews. Gestures - come. Bilal steps forward. Next he sees
ELMI -standing at the front, pleading...
ELMI (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)
Hey skinny. You take me. I watch
your back.
Musi nods. Elmi’s in. Musi scans the group, needing one more.
And here’s Najee - bigger than the rest. Focused and intense.
Najee stares hard, nods to Musi but won’t beg. Musi
thinking... then nods. Najee walks forward.
18

EXT. BEACH - EYL, SOMALIA - MINUTES LATER

18

Down at the waters edge the pirates load their skiffs - AK47’s, handguns, ammo, ladders. In the distance the 4x4’s
watching. And the young boy.
When it’s done the skiffs are launched and head out into the
bay towards a TRAWLER in the distance, anchored amongst other
hi-jacked vessels.
This is the pirate MOTHER SHIP...
19

INT. TAXI. PORT - SALALAH, OMAN. DAY

19

Phillips in a taxi.
His POV: Endless lines of containers.
20

EXT. PORT - SALALAH, OMAN - DAY
Phillips out of the taxi.
His POV: the Maersk Alabama. She's a CARGO SHIP: 508 feet
long, 83 feet abeam, displacing 31,000 tons of water. Not
pretty, but massive.

20

9.
21

EXT. ALABAMA - IN PORT - DAY

21

Phillips walks up the ladder with his case.
Above him huge CRANES swing containers carrying the American
flag and marked “World Food Program” into the Alabama’s hold.
22

EXT. ALABAMA - DECK - DAY

22

Phillips along the deck. Instantly in Captain-mode:
scrutinizing how the cranes are operating, the massive open
cargo hold, how the ship's CREW is moving... Eyeing
everything. Ahead of him: the ship’s house, seven-stories
tall, home to crew quarters, hospital, mess, engines and the
Bridge...
As he goes inside, he checks the PIRATE CAGES (welded bars
that are supposed to be protecting the STEPS rising up seven
stories from here to the Bridge.) They're unlocked.
23

INT. ALABAMA - CORRIDOR - E-DECK - DAY

23

Phillips walks along a corridor, rounding a corner.
A few CREWMEMBERS are laughing, very blue collar. As Phillips
appears, things tighten. The laughs get choked back. He's the
boss. And not big on goofing off.
Cap.
Morning.

UNNAMED CREW MEMBERS
PHILLIPS
Phillips ducks into:
24

INT. ALABAMA - E-DECK - CAPTAIN’S QUARTERS - MOMENTS LATER 24
Puts his case down. A merchant mariner’s life is measured out
in a thousand bare, impersonal cabins. Takes out the photo of
his family and places it on his desk.
He’s alone.

25

INT. ALABAMA - CAPTAIN’S OFFICE - DAY

25

An office beside the spacious CAPTAIN’S QUARTERS. Phillips
going through the “turnover notes” The outgoing captain LARRY
AASHEIM packing his bags, ready to go.
AASHEIM
(sliding over)
Logbook. Keys, safe combination.
PHILLIPS
(checking a list)
Fresh water.

10.
AASHEIM
Hundred sixty-six tons.
Fuel?

PHILLIPS

AASHEIM
Two hundred-fifty metric tons of
bunkers. Departure draft twelve-anda-half meters fore and aft.
PHILLIPS
Any Health Issues?
AASHEIM
One of the A-B’s is diabetic.
PHILLIPS
Slop-Chest?
AASHEIM
Up to date and closed. Harbor
Master in Mombasa wants two cartons
of cigarettes now, coming and
going.
Phillips makes a note of it - then notices something else:
A PIRACY ALERT... issued by UKMTO (United Kingdom Maritime
Traffic Office.) It’s a list of PIRATE ATTACKS on the EAF4
(East Africa) run in the last two weeks.
There are 23 known attacks listed. Phillips eyes it.
PHILLIPS
And when was the last security
drill?
AASHEIM
Two days out of Djibouti. Last leg.
It was fine. Say - are we done? I
gotta flight to catch.
PHILLIPS
Sure. We’re done.
AASHEIM
Okay. Your vessel.
Aasheim’s in a hurry, to get out.
PHILLIPS
Thank you Captain.
Phillips watches him go...

11.
26

INT. ALABAMA - BRIDGE - IN PORT - DAY

26

Phillips enters the bridge - nerve center of the Maersk
Alabama. We are 120 feet above the waterline, looking out at
a bright trouble-free day through huge windows.
MURPHY (O.S.)
Good to see you, Cap.
That's SHANE MURPHY: 27, tough as a bouncer but with a Boy
Scout face. From Seekon, Mass. Phillips loves this guy.
PHILLIPS
You too, Shane. Any problems with
the load?
Phillips makes his way to the coffee machine.
MURPHY
All hatches closed and dogged,
checking the lashings now.
Electrician’s troubleshooting a
reefer in Hold Two. Should be done
in a few.
PHILLIPS
You got the voyage plan?
MURPHY
You got it.
Phillips takes his place by the electronic maps, radar
screens, satellite-fed radios. Studies the route on the
console.
MURPHY (CONT’D)
Convoy down the coalition corridor
to Djibouti, exit south of Socotra.
Then on our own round the coast to
Mombasa.
PHILLIPS
(pointing to the sea off
Somalia)
Take us the direct route across
Somali waters will ya. I want us
straight through the danger zone.
And let’s pick up the security
around here. Got pirate cages
unlocked. Engine Door, Bridge Door,
Cargo Scuttle - all of 'em wide
open. I want 'em secured. Even in
port. Guys walking around with keyrings on their hips. Jesus Shane.
What kinda crew you handing me?

12.
Whoops. That was said just as TWO CREW-MEMBERS walk in: "ATM"
REZA (26, Pakistani American) & COLIN WRIGHT (30, Southerner)
- they just decided the new Captain is an asshole. That fast.
Cap.

ATM
Phillips barely acknowledges him. Off they go to the other
side of the bridge, unimpressed.
PHILLIPS
Call all hands - I want to be
underway by fifteen hundred.
Murphy eyes him, sobered, then nods "On it."
27

EXT. ALABAMA - BOW/STERN - LATER DAY

27

SEVEN CREW-MEMBERS at the bow, ANOTHER SEVEN at the stern,
dealing with lines and spotting - with a TUG in place, as:
28

INT. ALABAMA - BRIDGE - LATER DAY

28

Phillips at the helm, following push-back procedure.
PHILLIPS (INTO RADIO)
Bow and stern, single up. Hold your
springlines.
MURPHY (THRU RADIO)
Bridge, this is bow. We are singled
up, one on one on bow.
WRIGHT (INTO RADIO)
Bridge, stern. We are singled up,
one on one on stern.
PHILLIPS (INTO RADIO)
Okay, take your last lines in.
MURPHY (THRU RADIO)
All clear forward.
WRIGHT (THRU RADIO)
All clear aft.
PHILLIPS
Dead Slow Ahead.
Wright pushes the Engine Order Telegraph (throttle). The
giant ship begins to pull away from the berth.
29

EXT. ALABAMA - FROM THE WATER - CONTINUING
The Maersk Alabama puts to sea... Slow but muscular.

29

13.
30

EXT. ALABAMA - A-DECK - AT SEA - DAY

30

Phillips on his daily inspection - down a flight of stairs.
31

INT. ALABAMA - ENGINE CONTROL ROOM - DAY

31

Into the engine control room where the Chief Engineer, Mike
Perry, is monitoring the CRT screen displaying cylinder
temperature readings. JOHN CRONAN, Perry’s 1st, beside him.
PHILLIPS
‘Scuse me, Chief, I think I’m lost.
Where’s the deck with the outdoor
pool around here?
PERRY
(smiles, doesn’t look up)
A captain in an engine room? Yeah,
you are lost.
Phillips grins. Perry wipes the grease off his hand, shakes.
PERRY (CONT’D)
Good to see ya, Cap.
PHILLIPS
How we lookin’?
PERRY
(points to the screen)
Running a bit high on this one, but
we’ll get there.
Phillips looks at the dial.
PHILLIPS
Okay, well let me know if it acts
up and I’ll see ya at dinner. Don’t
forget, it’s black tie.
Perry chuckles. Phillips moves on.
32

EXT. ALABAMA - A-DECK - WALKWAY - DAY

32

Phillips along a walkway under the serried ranks of
containers. Out into the open.
His POV: The sea - the reason to do this job.
Turns a corner... and there, suspended above B-DECK is that
fiberglass LIFEBOAT. 28 feet long, enclosed, looks like an
orange submarine, sitting on SKIDS at a 45-degree angle.
Under it are two crew members, one points a hose at the
bottom of the lifeboat.
...until Phillips launches:

14.
PHILLIPS
No, not with a hose. Ya gotta get
up there in a harness and soogee
it, with a Turk’s Head. Does a
better job.
Crew 12 eyes him - are you serious?
PHILLIPS (CONT'D)
Hosin’ it ain’t the same.
(at crew 14)
And there’s no smoking on deck.
With that, he’s gone.
33

EXT. ABOVE THE ALABAMA - AERIAL - EVENING

33

The ship moves easily through the water.
34

INT. MAERSK - MESS-DECK - MESS - EVENING

34

CREW-MEMBERS drink coffee and fill out OVERTIME-SHEETS. On
one table a card game. On another it’s all about a strip bar
in Mombasa. Phillips walks in, carrying papers. Purposeful.
PHILLIPS
Shane, got those time sheets for
me?
Sure...

MURPHY
KEN QUINN
Hey, Cap. You taking us out when we
get into Mombassa?
MURPHY
Askin' the wrong guy, Kenny. Cap
never leaves the ship. Doesn’t
matter where we dock, he stays
aboard.
PHILLIPS
I'm married and I'm cheap. What'm I
gonna do on shore?
That brought a chuckle.
CRONAN
So how far out we goin' Cap?
Phillips tightens, instantly irritated. Eyes him.
PHILLIPS
Far enough to be safe, close enough
to get to Mombasa on schedule. That
okay with you guys?

15.
CRONAN
Aye - Aye Sir.
Phillips can fire back, or he can walk away. He walks away.
MURPHY
(embarrassed)
He's okay. Just likes things done
his way.
Looks at the faces. They’re not all convinced.
35

INT. ALABAMA - CAPTAIN’S QUARTERS - NIGHT

35

Phillips eats alone. Working. His family framed nearby.
Studies another maritime bulletin on his computer: “More
pirate attacks reported off the coast of East Africa.”
36

EXT. MOTHERSHIP - AT SEA - DAWN

36

A bright morning on the beautiful ocean. The trawler making
good speed.
37

INT. MOTHERSHIP - BRIDGE - SAME

37

Hufan, and Asad study a GPS display while Musi searches
channels on the radio. We hear an exchange in JAPANESE, one
in FRENCH. Then:
MURPHY (THRU RADIO)
Hamburg Queen, Hamburg Queen - this
is MV Maersk Alabama. I’m going to
alter my course to starboard to
keep a two-mile C-P-A. We will pass
port to port. How copy? Over.
Musi stares at the GPS, dragging his finger from one blip
("Hamburg Queen") to a second (closer to them). Hufan nods.
Asad not happy Musi has found the target.
HAMBURG QUEEN (THRU RADIO)
Maersk Alabama, Hamburg Queen.
Roger that. I see you six miles
ahead of me. I’ll pass port to
port. Hamburg Queen out.
38

INT. ALABAMA - BRIDGE - SAME (MORNING)
Murphy on the radio. ATM at the wheel.
MURPHY
(into radio)
Hamburg Queen, Maersk Alabama.
Thanks for the comeback. Clear and
out.
Murphy hangs up.

38

16.
39

INT. MOTHERSHIP - BRIDGE - RESUMING

39

Hufan, Musi, and Asad eye a large blip on the GPS display.
Americans?

HUFAN (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)
Musi and Asad nod, and walk out towards the skiffs.
40

INT. ALABAMA - BRIDGE - MORNING

40

Phillips enters, all business.
Hey Cap.

MURPHY
PHILLIPS
We're running a security drill
today. Unannounced. Starting now.
MURPHY
Sure thing, Cap.
Colin Wright is at the helm. Beside him are ATM and CLIFFORD
LACON (70, African American). Phillips leans in to Wright,
calmly:
PHILLIPS
It's Colin, yeah?
WRIGHT
Yes, Cap. Colin Wright.
PHILLIPS
There's a boat on our starboard
side. Two men with weapons, acting
hostile.
Wright turns.

freezes.

...Okay.

WRIGHT
PHILLIPS
So let’s go - right? Pirates, et
cetera.
Wright rings the GENERAL ALARM, which sounds throughout the
ship. LOUD.
PHILLIPS (CONT’D)
Not the general alarm. I want the
whistle first - to let the pirates
know you’re aware of them and are
ready to defend the ship.
Wright nods, sounds a WHISTLE (audible five miles away).

17.
PHILLIPS (CONT'D)
Now the General Alarm. Long-short,
long-short.
Done. ATM takes the helm.
PHILLIPS (CONT’D)
(to Lacon)
Cliff. Secure the bridge doors.
Got it.

LACON
Phillips leaves. A beat later, so does Lacon.
41

INT. ALABAMA - CONTROL ROOM - SAME. DAY

41

Guys file in, without urgency. It's just a drill.
42

INT. ALABAMA - A-DECK - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER. DAY

42

Phillips on every detail. Checks for unsecured doors, a CREWMEMBER moving about with keys jangling on his belt.
PHILLIPS
(to a passing steward)
What's the non-duress password?
STEWARD
Mister Jones.
PHILLIPS
No. That's the Secret Security
Alarm code. Non-duress is
"suppertime."
STEWARD
Suppertime. Got it.
PHILLIPS
And run the hoses out, right?
43

EXT. ALABAMA - A-DECK LATER (DAY)

43

Phillips watches as giant HIGH-PRESSURE FIRE HOSES are run
out and tied to the sides of the rails.
44

INT. MAERSK - BRIDGE - RESUMING
Murphy on the bridge:
MURPHY
Have we called UKMTO?
On it.

WRIGHT

Phillips returns to the bridge. Meets Lacon returning:

44

18.
PHILLIPS
Did you secure the doors?
LACON
Every door - every level. Closed
shut.
PHILLIPS
You closed them.
(Lacon nods)
Did you lock them? Secure them?
LACON
Um.... No. Just closing.
PHILLIPS
So if we were under attack...
Lacon’s silent.
PHILLIPS (CONT’D)
Okay, get to your muster point.
Lacon goes. Silence hangs for a second.
PHILLIPS (CONT’D)
We are in search of excellence but oh we will accept so much less.
MURPHY
How's it look down there?
PHILLIPS
Shaky. Got watertight doors open on
the Main Engine Level; they should
all be secured, with deadbolts.
That was in the Night Orders. Guys
running around with key-chains on
their hips. If they get taken in an
attack we got pirates with access
to every room on the ship. Let's
shut this down and bring everyone
into the Ship's Office for a
critique. Five minutes.
MURPHY
'Kay. Sorry about the screw-ups.
PHILLIPS
Don't be sorry. Be angry. They'll
jump higher.
Murphy nods, shuts off the alarm. Phillips turns away.
...when something catches his eye. THREE BLIPS - coming from
the 10-cm RADAR SCREEN. Odd.

19.
He stops. Leans in. The BLIPS indicate THREE SMALL VESSELS,
seven miles astern, moving in on us. Fast.
Just like they would if this were the real thing. Hmmm...
Phillips picks up a pair of binoculars, heads outside to:
45

EXT. ALABAMA - STARBOARD BRIDGE-WING. CONTINUING

45

Phillips lifts the binoculars, to find:
Two skiffs pounding through FOUR-FOOT SWELLS at 21 knots,
right at us. A TRAWLER behind them. We can't see faces yet
but they’re moving like pirates would. Real ones.
46

EXT. ALABAMA - PORT SIDE BRIDGE WING - RESUMING - DAY

46

Phillips lowers the binoculars. Collects himself.
47

INT. ALABAMA - BRIDGE - CONTINUING. DAY
He walks back in.
MURPHY
(to Phillips)
Everything okay?
PHILLIPS
We got two skiffs, incoming.
MURPHY
(moving to the radar)
In the middle of the day? Gotta be
fishermen.
Phillips look says, “I don’t think so.” Grabs the radio:
PHILLIPS
Chief, control room, stand by.
PERRY (THRU RADIO)
We still in the drill, Cap?
PHILLIPS
Not a drill. Real world.
Phillips makes his way to the RADAR.
PHILLIPS (CONT’D)
(to Wright)
Give me left-five degrees.
WRIGHT
(turning the wheel)
Left-five.

47

20.
48

EXT. ALABAMA STERN - FROM BELOW - SAME - DAY

The unease in here going unaddressed... until:
ATM
So what’s the plan, Cap - if they
come back?
There it was. Phillips pauses. The guys await an answer.
PHILLIPS
Same drill.
(No-one looks convinced)
We got speed. We got height. And we
got hoses. That’s a lot of
advantages.
PERRY
We don’t have weapons though. Do
we?
A few guys nod. Clearly, it's been discussed in here tonight.
QUINN
Maybe we should.
PHILLIPS
Sorry. The guys who own this ship
disagree, and they sign the checks.
QUINN
They’re not out here.
PHILLIPS
Come on fellas - you know as well
as I do ships start carrying guns,
pirates are going to come back with
mortars. We start carrying depth
charges, pirates are going to come
back with rocket-launchers. Besides
that, there are ports on this run
that won't allow an armed ship to
dock.
CRONAN
So if they board us - what - we
just hide?

PHILLIPS
We follow the protocol, lock down
and wait for help.
CRONAN
And end up in Somalia hoping the
company pay a ransom? The hell with
that..
ATM
Rather put up a fight.
This isn't going anywhere good. Phillips reads the faces then:
PHILLIPS
You guys wanna know the truth?
(they're waiting)
The truth is, I don't feel any
better about this than you do. But
I don't own this vessel. I just
work here.
(that landed)
You wanna change the rules? Buy a
shipping line. Until then, we're
here for the ship; the ship isn't
here for us. Anybody who can't
accept that can deboard at Mombasa.
I won’t think any less of you.
Silence. No one replies. But he just gained some respect...

MURPHY (INTO WALKIE)
Not the Bridge?
PHILLIPS (INTO WALKIE)
Repeat: The Engine Room! If this

down. It’s more secure and I need
you there to take command.
Murphy takes off.

As Musi climbs, the Alabama turns and then turns back again
slamming violently into the skiff. Musi almost slips. The
skiff’s hull beginning to CRACK. Now what?
Musi, halfway up the ladder, shouts at his men:
MUSI (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)
Forget the boat! Everybody up!
THUMP. The skiff takes another hit - just as Bilal grabs the
ladder. Elmi still on the tiller. Najee grabs the ladder.
Skiff beginning to COME APART now. Elmi reaches...
...and grabs the ladder just as the skiff is sucked down by
the under tow and slowly chewed up. The pirates eye it from

Phillips didn’t expect that. Not one bit. But he appreciates

Phillips knows they’re coming, but his voice remains still:
PHILLIPS (MIC, CONT’D)
Don’t appear too confrontational or
too meek. If you're screaming at

you give them a personal reason to

Musi and the pirates, nearing the top of the ladder...
PHILLIPS
Bottom line is, look out for each
other. Stick together. We’ll be all
right.
He puts down the radio. ATM and Wright are silent. A moment
between them. Then Phillips grabs a JACKKNIFE off a table,
pockets it...
...as the sound of an AK-47, firing, spins our head around.

43.
The bridge-door opens - Najee rushing in, pointing that AK at
us and shouting in Somali like a guy on a meth-bender. Chaos.
Elmi and Bilal behind him. ATM and Wright drop to their
knees, hands up. Phillips freezes. He has lost the bridge.
Najee shouting. ATM and Wright scared witless. Musi glides in
last. We PUSH IN on Phillips as they come face to face for
the first time - Then:
MUSI
Relax, Captain, relax. No Al Qaeda.
No Al Qaeda. We’re Somali pirates.
Just business. You stop the ship.
Phillips nods. Musi looks the bridge over, sees Wright and
ATM - confused to see a black sailor.
MUSI (CONT'D)
What nationality?
PHILLIPS
Me? Or the ship?
MUSI
The ship. American?
PHILLIPS
Yes. American ship.
That's BIG NEWS. Musi nods, pleased. Najee WHOOPS. Big whoops
from all pirates. Phillips hitting KNOBS on the console -MUSI
Bigggg Yankee ship. You Yankee too?
PHILLIPS
Sure. Yankee Irish...
MUSI
Okay. Just business Irish. Just
business. Where's your crew?
PHILLIPS
I don't know. I'm here with you.

...with a SHUDDER, the thrum of the ship's engine STOPS.
Then, that fast, the POWER GOES OUT. Consoles, screens, A/C.
All dead. And we're adrift. Musi looks around.
MUSI
What is that?
PHILLIPS
(trying console controls)
We shut the engines down too fast.
(pure bullshit)
There's a check-down procedure. We
rushed it, knocked out the grid.
Move.

MUSI
Phillips obliges. Musi tries the instruments, futilely, as:
PHILLIPS
We shut it down too fast. Ship’s
broken now.
Phillips moves to the RADAR. Three knobs on it. He turns down
the "gain" knob and turns up the "anti-rain" and "anti-seaclutter" knobs. Then he moves toward the VHF radio..

PHILLIPS
Hey, your guys want some water? Or
cigarettes? I got a couple cartons
here.
MUSI
Cigarettes.
PHILLIPS
ATM, grab some sodas for these
guys, will you?
Sure, Cap.

ATM
Phillips hands packs of cigarettes to Musi and his men. ATM
grabs a few sodas, offers them. Najee glares: "If I want it,
I'll take it.” Elmi starts rifling through cabinets.
PHILLIPS (CONT'D)
Hungry?
(Elmi grunts)
You're in luck. We've got seventeen
tons of wheat and peas in the hold.
It was meant to feed most of Kenya,
but what the hell - go to town.

46.
MUSI
What else you carrying? Irish?
Huh?

PHILLIPS
MUSI
American ship. You carrying cars,
tv's, guns, what else you got?
PHILLIPS
Sorry. All we're moving is the
food, nothing else.
Musi studies Phillips, as if trying to x-ray him for truth. A
beat, then he moves to the radio. Tries to get it going.
Phillips sits beside Wright.
WRIGHT
(quietly)
How much we got in the safe?
PHILLIPS
Less than they want.
WRIGHT
A couple grand, right? Maybe we
give it to 'em and they go away.
PHILLIPS
It's a U.S. ship, Colin. They're
thinking millions - not thirty
grand.
WRIGHT
So what do we do?
Off Phillips thinking as:
Musi bangs the radio with frustration, trying to re-set it.
Turns, temper flaring:
MUSI (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)
(to Najee re: radio)
It’s not working.
PHILLIPS
I don’t know what to tell you.
Maybe something shorted out when we
powered down.
NAJEE (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)
(agitated, at Musi)
So we can’t talk to Hufan?

47.
MUSI
(ignoring Najee)
Get your engineer to fix it. Where
is your crew, Irish?
PHILLIPS
I don't know. I'm here with you.
MUSI
Get them up here. Now! If not,
these crazy-guys kill you!
Elmi and Najee jump as if they'd been plugged into a socket:
shouting again, pointing the AK's:
ELMI/NAJEE
Down! Down!
ATM and Wright drop their heads, the AK's pressed inches away
from them now. Things just ramped up in a hurry.
MUSI
You want to die? Two minutes, they
kill you! They kill your men!
PHILLIPS
Take it easy. I'm doing my best.
NAJEE
Minute thirty now!
MUSI

Wright looks to Phillips, who moves again to the P.A. MIKE.

Hey. You wanna shoot somebody,

Elmi pushes him away, hard. Phillips falls, but he manages to

Phillips struggles to his feet.
NAJEE

WRIGHT
Cap? Please!?
NAJEE

Najee yells. Elmi and Bilal too. Deafening. Now Wright starts
yelling too. Then suddenly: A knock, at the bridge door.
Everything stops. Every head turns. Musi nods to Phillips:
"Go open it." Phillips crosses to the door, opens it. Sighs.
...because it's CLIFF LACON. Of course. Right where he
shouldn't be. Phillips can hardly believe it.
LACON
Cap?
As the pirates react, Phillips discreetly keys his radio so
this’ll be broadcast.
PHILLIPS
C'mon in, Cliff. Drill’s over.
Elmi grabs Lacon by the collar and puts him on the ground
next to ATM and Wright, as:

Hearing Phillips, the crew breathes a sigh of relief.
180

But the crisis, oddly, has passed. Musi grabs his AK-47,
pushing Phillips roughly towards the door, as if to cover his
change of direction. But Phillips notes it, keeping his radio
keyed.
Let's go.

MUSI

the lights overhead...

Phillips, continuing to broadcast:
PHILLIPS
We’ll search the ship, deck by deckstarting at the top.
Musi pushes Phillips to the door, then nods to Bilal and
points to a flashlight. Bilal picks it up and raises his gun
to cover Phillips. The ship drifting...
MUSI (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)
(to Najee re: Wright, ATM,
and LACON)
Watch them.
(to Elmi, indicating
outside)
Get out there. Keep your eyes open.
They nod. Then Musi spots Phillips’ radio. He eyes Phillips,
then grabs it off his belt and throws it on a table.
MUSI (CONT’D)
You don’t need this. Move.
Phillips, Musi, and Bilal exit.

We're in semi-DARKNESS. Every fourth light lit. And we're

PHILLIPS
This is E-Deck- the first of 5. We
should check the crew quarters
first- then probably the cargo
hold. First room...
Phillips takes out his keys and begins to slowly sort through
them. Musi watches impatiently. Phillips finds a key, puts it
in the door and opens it: It’s A CLOSET with mops and brooms.

The place feels palatial to him. A large room, sunlit by big
windows, with an OFFICE and a SATELLITE OFFICE jutting off
it. He begins to drift through, taking it all in.
PHILLIPS
These are my quarters.

53.
Musi is oblivious. Sees to one side: a MIRROR. The biggest
one he’s ever seen. Then he notices the family photo Andrea, and the kids. Musi reacts; Phillips catches it.
PHILLIPS (CONT'D)
You have a family?
Musi looks at the picture. Ignores the question.
MUSI

PHILLIPS
What? You thought we were all

No reply. Musi sees a PAIR OF SANDALS on the floor. He grabs
them, sits down, and swaps his for them. Phillips observes
the barefooted Bilal watching enviously...
MUSI
You Christian?
PHILLIPS
Does it matter?
MUSI
I ask, you answer. Easy.

metal WALKWAY jutting off the Bridge. Elmi is currently
standing guard on it, meaning he can see from here straight
through to the Generator below.

Phillips "fumbles" his keys, stalling... then he opens the

He sees a lump on the mess-table, a BLANKET clumsily covering
the water jugs, food-bags... Phillips looks around for a sign
of someone, then starts walking toward the KITCHEN.
PHILLIPS
You guys hungry? Got some melon in
the fridge. You should take it.
It's just gonna spoil anyway.
Musi plugs a piece of khat into his mouth and starts chewing.
MUSI
No food. Hurry.
And that’s when Phillips spots the edge of Murphy's shoe,
sticking out from under a desk. Bilal's bare feet are just
inches away. Phillips opens the fridge.
PHILLIPS
You sure you don’t want some of
this stuff?
Turns with four big CANTALOUPES, and some JUICE-BOXES and
“accidently” steps hard on Bilal’s bare foot, then kicks
Murphy’s foot. Bilal yells. Gets a sharp look from Musi.
PHILLIPS (CONT’D)
Sorry, I didn’t see you had no
shoes.
(re: Bilal’s AK)
You want the food or not? I can

Perry STOPS, stares up.
...at Elmi, who leans over the rail, shoving Khat into his
mouth. He’s right above where Perry needs to go. Shit...
Then, an idea. Perry grabs the microphone from his radio and
yanks it off the cord. Looks up at Elmi. Then throws the mic
as hard as he can in the opposite direction of the generator.
A NOISE. Elmi turns toward it, then yells to Najee:
ELMI (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)
I’m going downstairs!

Phillips leads Musi and Bilal toward the Engine Room door,
well aware that his crew is on the other side of it.
PHILLIPS
Hang on, lemme just find the Engine
Room key. Wow, it's hot down here.
MUSI
All your crew weak like you?
PHILLIPS
(bristling)
My men are merchant mariners. We
built America, pal, and a whole lot
else.
MUSI
Yeah? What you build in Somalia?
Phillips lets it go. They step toward the door... when:
...we hear a CRUNCHING SOUND, and a groan from Bilal. He just
stepped on what we now see is BROKEN GLASS, by the door.
The kid winces in silence. Musi eyes him, then looks to
Phillips. Musi pushes them forward - as:
208

EXT. ALABAMA - MAIN DECK - RESUMING

208

Elmi gets to the bottom of the stairway and runs away from
the generator.
...as Perry gets to the generator. It has a lid that’s bolted
down. He pulls out a wrench and begins to loosen the nuts...
209

INT. ALABAMA - ENGINE ROOM - SAME - DAY

The Engine Room door opens. Phillips pauses in the doorway,
radar up. Bilal is on one foot now, in searing pain...
The men - hiding all over this vast space - are easy targets
with the emergency lights still on.
PHILLIPS
(calls out)
Anyone here? Guys? Are you there?
Time to come out.
Ken Quinn looks to Cronan, who quietly grabs a JACK-KNIFE...
MUSI
Why they don’t come when you call,
Irish? They don't like you?
Phillips hadn't expected that. He pauses while his men listen
in.

59.
PHILLIPS
Not much, no. I think they think
I'm a prick.
That landed - on the faces of Phillips' men...
MUSI
What that word mean? Prick.
PHILLIPS
A guy who keeps telling you what a
horse's ass you are 'cause he
thinks it'll make you work harder.
MUSI
Then I'm a prick! Good to be a
prick, right? If you’re a captain.
No.

PHILLIPS

MUSI
Yeah! You keep 'em scared, they
sail better - then you don't have
pirates taking your ship away.
PHILLIPS
That wasn't them. That was me.
(a beat)
I thought we’d be okay. I thought
you’d never get up on a ship this
high. It was a bad call, all mine.
The men heard that too.
MUSI
Maybe you getting too old for this
game.... Hey Bilal!
He nods toward a TURBINE. Ken Quinn is hiding behind it.
Bilal starts hobbling right at him.

Perry gets the last bolt loosened. He rips the lid off the

Musi stops dead in his tracks. Cannot see a thing.
MUSI

PHILLIPS
Emergency generator must've failed.

Elmi sprinting, rounds the corner, sees the generator cover

A FLASHLIGHT BEAM hits Phillips' face. The rest of the world
is PITCH-BLACK. Drifting, creaking... creepy even by pirate
standards.
MUSI
How come nothing work on this boat,
Irish?
PHILLIPS
Bad luck, I guess. Wanna check the
decks now?
MUSI
No. We keep looking down here.
PHILLIPS
(re: Bilal’s foot)
Dragging him around? You’ll be here
all week.
Musi shines his flashlight on Bilal’s foot, which is gushing
blood on to the floor. Weighs his next move.
MUSI
You’re bad luck. You know that?
(to Bilal, SUBTITLED:)
Take him upstairs. Send Najee down.
Bilal nods, prods Phillips with the AK toward the door.
Phillips has no choice. He leads Bilal out.
Musi, alone now in the darkness, LIGHTS A CIGARETTE and pulls
out his long knife...

61.
Across the room, Cronan and the rest of the crew see it. They
nod to each other.

Phillips and Bilal walk on to the bridge. Najee still has
Wright, ATM, and Lacon at gunpoint.
NAJEE (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)
Where’s Musi?
BILAL (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)
In the engine room. He wants you.
NAJEE (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)
I wait for Elmi.
See Phillips’ wheels turn. He eyes Bilal, the bleeding foot.
PHILLIPS
You should wash that.
(Bilal is listening)
We got a sick bay. Lacon here knows
what to do.
But Najee’s AK47 goes up. Straight no.
PHILLIPS (CONT’D)
Okay. Okay. Just trying to help.
But Bilal saw.

Musi finishes his cigarette. Cronan, preparing to move,
shifts his weight slightly... and makes a SOUND.
Musi REACTS, and shines his flashlight: He sees a glimpse of
Cronin’s head. Musi grabs his AK AND FIRES- just missing him.
Musi bolts toward the crew, AK slung and ready.
Cronan ducks away into darkness, crew scattering.
Musi, running through DARKNESS, then a JOLT - out of nowhere Perry just returned, lunging at Musi with the JACK-KNIFE,
slicing into Musi's hand. Musi howls, drops his AK-47.
Cronan jumps in now, then OTHER SAILORS, from every side.
Slamming Musi up against a bulkhead. For a moment it looks
like they’ll kill him.
Then a flashlight lights them up. The guys turn to see...
Hey.

Elmi enters, breathing hard. Najee eyes him, “And?”
ELMI (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)
I didn’t find anything...
Najee sighs, disgusted. Chews some Khat. Then:
MURPHY (THRU RADIO)
Hey, Pirates. Come in, Pirates.
The Pirates turn, deeply thrown. That voice, crackling
through the RADIO overhead. Who is that?
MURPHY (THRU RADIO) (CONT’D)
This is the crew of the Maersk

Phillips reacts. The pirates do too.

The entire crew huddled around Musi, a knife at his throat.
MURPHY (THRU RADIO)
Do you read, Pirates? We have your

trade him. Your Captain for ours.
BACK TO THE BRIDGE - Phillips watches Elmi and Bilal; they’re
lost. Najee, putting himself in charge, grabs the radio.
NAJEE (INTO RADIO)
You have our guy?
PERRY (THRU RADIO)
Yeah. We got him.
NAJEE (INTO RADIO)
Show me.
(aloud, in Somali:)
What’s going on, Skinny?
Perry looks to Musi: Speak. Musi replies.
MUSI (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)
Do what they say. Make a deal!
NAJEE (INTO RADIO, SUBTITLED)
We don't have a boat.
PHILLIPS

Take our lifeboat.

Najee and Bilal, covering Phillips, eye the lifeboat: If
released, anyone inside will drop down skids 45 feet straight
into the sea.
20 feet away Murphy brings the dollars from the safe. Cronan
brings a box of FOOD and water.
...while, overlooking all this from C-DECK, five CREW-MEMBERS
hold Musi - a knife to his throat, his hand bleeding badly.
Phillips and Musi lock eyes from a distance... as:
PHILLIPS (CONT'D)
Crew holding up okay?
MURPHY
Couple heat-strokes, but they're
fine.
PHILLIPS
See that they get treated, huh?
He turns to the pirates:
PHILLIPS (CONT'D)
Okay. Get yourselves harnessed in.
We'll do the exchange once you're
in the water.
No.

NAJEE
That halted things. Murphy thrown. Phillips keeps calm, as:
NAJEE (CONT'D)
Someone coming with us, show us how
the boat works - ‘til we get our
captain back.

64.
MURPHY
That wasn't the deal, Asshole.
Najee points an AK right at Murphy's head, and:
New deal.

NAJEE
Everyone stiffens. Najee turns, aims at the rest of the crew.
- Elmi shouting.
Musi, one deck up, watching intently.
....as Phillips steps forward.
PHILLIPS
You want your Captain back? Ya
gotta keep calm - and stop
threatening my crew. Understand?
NAJEE
You do what we say, nobody bother
nobody.

So- who comes?
Musi watching as we PUSH IN on Phillips.
PHILLIPS
It’ll be me. I’ll do it.
MURPHY
(interrupting)
Cap, I got it.
PHILLIPS
I didn’t ask for volunteers.
(to Najee)
Let’s go.
The pirates head for the lifeboat with Phillips. Murphy and
the crew can’t believe it.
... neither can Musi.
PHILLIPS (CONT’D)
Send him down once we're underway.
On the ladder amidship.
MURPHY
Cap, you get in there with them,
you ain't comin' out.
PHILLIPS
We want 'em off the boat, right?

65.
MURPHY
Yeah. But not like this.

Bilal, Elmi, and Najee harness themselves in, facing aft.
PHILLIPS (CONT’D)
Chief, they can still strafe the
ship, so keep the guys out of
harm's way.
PERRY (THRU RADIO)
Roger that.
PHILLIPS (INTO LIFEBOAT RADIO)
Okay. Releasing lifeboat now.
Phillips puts the radio down, harnesses himself in, grabs a
RELEASE VALVE, (a hydraulic pump.) Starts PUMPING it.

A COG holds the lifeboat on these skids. It begins to recede,
hydraulically, as Phillips keeps pumping the valve. A few
more pumps on it, then:
...the COG on the skids falls away.
...and the lifeboat, unmoored, rockets down the skids. 12
feet, like a sled, nose down, then off the edge of the ship:

The pirates are stunned by their own velocity. Phillips
braces himself. The surface rushing up to meet him, then:
A THUNDEROUS PLUNGE as the lifeboat smashes into the sea,
sending up a huge plume, vanishing under water.
It's like a car wreck in here, bodies hurtling, banging,
restrained by those harnesses. Water ABOVE us... until:

The nose of the lifeboat breaches the surface, its bridge ten

Phillips gathers his wits, looks to his passengers.

Goes back up to the control console, covered by Najee.

engine - idles alongside 20 feet below, amidship.
MURPHY
You go in, he comes out. Right?
Sure.

MUSI
That sounded ominous. The whole crew is watching from various

Phillips watching too. Bilal nervously opens the aft hatch,
pointing his AK up at the crew. Musi descending as:
Phillips looks up, locking eyes with Murphy on the deck - the
height of the Alabama standing between them, that and the
fact that Najee has an AK47 at Phillips head.
Phillips nods. Murphy returns it. Musi reaches the hatch, and
climbs in - leaving it open.

Okay, transfer complete. Come on

Castellano looks at the digital displays. Maps.

Musi dogs the hatch closed, glaring at Phillips.

between the pirates. Najee walks over to Bilal:
Khat.

NAJEE
Bilal reaches into his pocket - emptying the last few reeds.
BILAL (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)
This is everything.
Najee snatches it hungrily.
NAJEE (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)

You take too much!
MUSI (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)

Phillips noted that too. He points to a water jug. Bilal
passes it over, nervously.
NAJEE (O.C.)
This is shit!
MUSI (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)
I am Captain. Not you!
Phillips watching. There’s a desperation in this guy Najee Phillips is factoring that in as well.
Musi, aware that Phillips is watching him, keeps counting his blood continuing to drip on to the floor.
PHILLIPS
You want me to look at that?

Your hand.
It’s fine.

Yeah, sure... unless it gets

You might at least let me fix his

Phillips gestures to Bilal. Bilal gets the idea, and he is
very much in favor - but:
NAJEE (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)
(gun up)
Don’t let him do it.
Now Musi can’t say yes. Phillips notes that.
MUSI
Doctor treat him when we get home.
PHILLIPS
How're the sandals? They fit okay?
That lands. Musi thinks...
MUSI
You trouble, Irish. Yeah, you a
problem.
Musi nods to Bilal: it’s okay. Najee not happy about it.
Phillips rises, gets a MED-KIT. Pulls out SALINE WASH, gauze,
tape, disinfectant. He pulls the JACK-KNIFE from his back
pocket, start to cut a length of tape with it, but:
Najee - can’t the believe this guy’s had a KNIFE on him all
along - snatches it away, his eyes livid.
Phillips shrugs, tears the tape with his hands, keeps his
attention on Bilal. Najee pockets the knife, and backs away,
his eyes never leaving Phillips.
Phillips begins to clean out Bilal’s foot.
PHILLIPS
How old are you?
BILAL
...Seventeen.
PHILLIPS
You’re young. To be here.

Phillips turns. Najee is tearing cigarette butts apart to get
one last smoke. Elmi struggles to steer, Musi telling him
what to do while checking on the position of the Alabama.
Najee’s cannibalized cigarette just fell apart. He throws
what’s left of it on the floor, cursing loudly - at Musi too.
PHILLIPS
Hey, it’s goddamn hot. How’s if we
opened the fore hatch.
NAJEE
You don’t give orders here.
Najee turns - and joins the argument on the bridge:

MUSI
No trouble, Irish. Just this boat.
Slow piece of shit.
PHILLIPS
Yeah, draft’s shallow and you’re
fighting the current. You gotta--

76.
MUSI
--I know what I’m doing.
PHILLIPS
‘Course you do; you’re the captain.
(that landed)
Say, Captain, can we open the hatch
and get some air in here?
Najee, glaring at Phillips, kicks a seat in front of him.
MUSI (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)
(to Najee)
What’s your problem?
Najee grumbles. Musi’s SAT-PHONE call fails; it’s annoying.
PHILLIPS
Little air might do him some good.
MUSI
Yeah, sure, hatches open so your
crew can try something. No tricks,
Irish.
He walks away, leaving this oven airless and closed-in...

EXT. LIFEBOAT- DUSK.

Still motoring with the Alabama trailing...
250

INT. LIFEBOAT - MOVING - DUSK

250

Phillips chews a protein bar, watching everything:
Musi is trying to get Elmi to go faster. Keeping an eye on
the Alabama behind. And trying to wrap a bit of cloth around
his hand. It SPASMS again. Bilal sits alone, trying to master
a ROPE-KNOT Najee is teaching him. Najee’s eyes on Phillips
throughout.
THUMP THUMP THUMP. The sound turns our heads. It's Elmi
trying to break a WINDOW ON THE BRIDGE with the butt of his
AK-47.
PHILLIPS
Ya might ask him to stop that,
before he takes his head off.
MUSI
He wants more air.
PHILLIPS
But he's still got the clip in.
Musi barks at Elmi in Somali. Elmi grunts, annoyed, then
removes the clip from the AK and starts banging again...

77.
Finally, he breaks a pane. A small trickle of air blows in.
Elmi inhales it greedily. Najee too, edgy as ever.
PHILLIPS (CONT’D)
You’re gonna need more water.
(Musi turns)
Your men are in withdrawal. From
the Khat, is that what you call
it?. You’re gonna need more water.
MUSI
Why you think you know everything?
PHILLIPS
I know what sailors look like when
they’re coming down.
Musi’s hand is getting worse. And he’s perspiring.
MUSI
We get home, we get all the water
we want. I can buy a million
dollars of it.
PHILLIPS
That right?
MUSI
Oh yah. Last year I knock off a
Greek ship, make six million
dollars.
PHILLIPS
Then what're you doing here?
Musi just got unmasked. He didn't like it.
MUSI
(flaring)
Shut up Irish! Too much talk.
PHILLIPS
(flaring too)
Your problem isn’t me talking. Your
problem is you not listening.
Najee’s had enough. He approaches Phillips, AK-47 poised.
NAJEE (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)
I’m sick of him! Is he in charge
now?
MUSI (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)
Najee! Put it down!
NAJEE (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)
Sick of this boat.

78.
MUSI (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)
Put it down!
NAJEE (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)
(meaning Musi)
This is all messed up!
Najee tosses Phillips’ Jack-knife at the floor, an inch from
Phillips’ feet.
Silence. Bilal wide-eyed. Phillips clocking it all, shifts
his weight forward. Is he about to make a move?
PHILLIPS
Who’s the Captain here?
I am!

MUSI

And Musi raises his gun at Najee. Phillips anticipating...
NAJEE (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)
I say we kill him, take the money
and go home!
MUSI (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)
And I say we-Just then, everything goes SIDEWAYS.
A MASSIVE WAVE hits us, just about knocking us over.
...as a DEAFENING SIREN crushes our ears (the Bainbridge's
LONG-RANGE ACOUSTICAL DEVICE, or "L-Rad.")
And a BLINDING LIGHT suddenly hammers us, like lasers through
the windows.
The threefold effect is like having a FREIGHT TRAIN drive
through the boat. Everyone covers their ears, shuts their
eyes, lowers their heads, grabs on to anything near.
The light is BLINDING - the noise too - but we can't see
their source. The Pirates can't either.
MUSI (CONT’D)
What is that?! What is that?!
Phillips takes a step towards the bridge and that fast he’s
got TWO AK-47’s an inch from his face. So he freezes, for:
PHILLIPS
(has to shout)
Put it in reverse!
ELMI
I can’t see.

79.
PHILLIPS
It’s a more powerful gear! Put it
in reverse!
NAJEE
You sit down!
Najee jabs the AK in his ribs. Phillips sits. The boat rocks,
the SOUND deafening us, LIGHT blinding us... As MUSI opens
the hatch. His eyes just went wide...
HIS POV: the Bainbridge, on site circling the lifeboat. We
can just see its OUTLINE because of the BLINDING LIGHT
hitting us from its bow.
BACK TO MUSI - as he drops down, closes the hatch, faces his
men, and Phillips. That L-RAD still howling.
MUSI
Navy ship! US Navy!
Instant reaction: pirates grabbing guns, battle-stations.
And a reaction from Phillips too: he knows, intuitively, that
the game has just changed, utterly.
Then the L-RAD STOPS.
...and a VOICE hits our LIFEBOAT RADIO:
COMMS OFFICER (THRU LIFEBOAT RADIO)
This is the United States Navy. You
are directed to throw your weapons
over the side and put your hands in
the air. You will not be harmed.
Musi eyes his men... then grabs the microphone.
MUSI (INTO LIFEBOAT RADIO)
No Military action! No Military
action! We’re just fishermen - no
Al Qaeda! Just fishermen. We have
American Captain right here.

Castellano stands amid the hub that is the CIC.
On Castellano’s right is NEMO, a SOMALI-BORN INTERPRETER, now

MUSI (INTO RADIO, SUBTITLED)

Phillips watches as the pirates look through the tiny
portholes - trying desperately to see what’s going on.
NEMO (INTO RADIO, SUBTITLED)
I'm Nemo, born in Somalia. I
translate for the US Navy - make
sure there’s no misunderstanding.
What's your name? So I know what to
call you.
MUSI (INTO RADIO, SUBTITLED)
Call me Captain.
NEMO (INTO RADIO, SUBTITLED)
Where are you from, Captain?
Puntland?
MUSI (INTO RADIO, SUBTITLED)
You talking to insurance man yet?
NEMO (INTO RADIO, SUBTITLED)
We’re working on that.
MUSI (INTO RADIO, SUBTITLED)
Tell them we want two million

Castellano watching... as Nemo stays on script:
NEMO (INTO RADIO, SUBTITLED)
Okay, take it easy - we gotta talk
this thing out first. You okay on
food and water?
MUSI (INTO RADIO, SUBTITLED)
Insurance man. That’s who we need
to be talking to now.
NEMO (INTO RADIO, SUBTITLED)
Like I say, we’ll work on that.
Sounds like you need some food and
water first, and we need to see our

Musi - that sudden gambler’s grin, with anxiety behind it:
MUSI
See, everything working Irish.
You’ll see. It’s just business.
Ship owners always pay.
Musi goes to the window.
PHILLIPS
You think so, Captain?
MUSI
(feigned confidence)
Sure. And now we got a Navy escort!
Keep other pirates away.
PHILLIPS
The Navy’s not here to escort you.
They aren’t here to negotiate
either.
MUSI
They have to. I got you!
That lands. Phillips looks to Bilal, who seems to know that
things have just gotten a lot scarier - but can’t say so.
Their eyes meet, until the kid looks away.
We RETURN TO:

Phillips watches as Musi looks through the side window.
They see the ALABAMA, now sailing away. That makes him smile.
He leans back in, for:
MUSI
Your crew running away, Irish. They
leaving you.
PHILLIPS
They’re sailors. And they see a
storm coming. Don’t you?
Musi shrugs that off, but it registered - with Bilal too.
Then a SOUND gets Musi’s attention: the approach of the NAVY
ZODIAC - Nemo, a fellow Somali, standing tall, holding a box.
The Zodiac reaches the lifeboat, and idles...
NEMO (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)
Hey brother.

Phillips watches as: Musi crosses to the AFT HATCH. Najee
covering with his AK.

PHILLIPS
Yeah. Little hot. But okay. Does my

NEMO
Don’t worry Captain. We’re keeping
them updated.
PHILLIPS
So what’s the plan?
NEMO
We’re handling it. You’ll be okay.
Just sit tight.
PHILLIPS

SCANEAGLE flies overhead. Musi eyes it. Najee too.
NAJEE

Everyone turns - was he kidding? Najee pushes the gun into
Phillips’ ear.
PHILLIPS (CONT’D)
They ran outta Khat and they’re
crashing pretty hard. Anything
that’ll calm them down.
He just sent a message - and Najee didn’t like it:
Enough!

NAJEE
NEMO (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)
(to Musi)
We have doctors on the ship,
medicine. They can treat you - and
we can talk about all this.
MUSI (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)
Got doctors back home, too. And get
back! Get the ship back.
NEMO (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)

That where you’re headed?
MUSI (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)
(off Nemo’s discomfort)
You got the two million dollars
yet?
NEMO (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)
This is the Navy, brother - not a

MUSI (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)
Then I talk to insurance man, not
the delivery boy.
(getting agitated)
And your ship too close. Get it
back, right. Get it back!
NEMO (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)
Okay. Easy. I’ll talk to them.
MUSI
Better make it fast. Your Captain
wanna see his family again.
Phillips locks with Musi. Then Phillips turns. His POV:
SAILOR #2 is craning around to look inside the lifeboat.
Phillips notices this, and tries to distract Najee:

PHILLIPS
Hey, could you loosen up just a
bit?
No talk!

NAJEE

Sailor 2 leaning forward...
SAILOR #2 (INTO HIDDEN MIC)
Got another inside. AK 47. That’s

NEMO (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)
Brother, it’s not that easy. It
takes time-MUSI
Don’t “Brother” shit me! Fake
Somali! You tell insurance we want
the dollars!
(points to the Bainbridge)
And I told you - get that ship
back!
NEMO (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)

Tell them we need the money! You

NAJEE (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)
Too much talk! You have to show

NAJEE (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)
A beat. Musi on his heels. Then he picks up the handset.
MUSI (INTO LIFEBOAT RADIO)
Just an accident.
CASTELLANO (THRU RADIO)

MUSI (INTO LIFEBOAT RADIO)
No-one hurt. The American is fine.
CASTELLANO (THRU RADIO)
I need to hear it from him.
MUSI (INTO LIFEBOAT RADIO)
I said he’s okay.
CASTELLANO (THRU RADIO)
I need to hear from him. You read?
Musi nods to Phillips. Keys radio. Phillips glares at Musi,
then calls out, aloud - as Musi holds the radio out:
PHILLIPS
I’m okay. I’m fine.
No duress?

CASTELLANO (THRU RADIO)

PHILLIPS
I’m fine. But these guys need some
sedatives.
CASTELLANO (THRU RADIO)

Four sets of eyes watching Musi now... What will he do?
Musi’s hand spasms badly. And this is spat out, at Phillips:
MUSI (INTO LIFEBOAT RADIO)
We talk when we get back home.

Let’s go!
Elmi guns the engine; the lifeboat takes off again. Najee
likes the decision. But Bilal knows better - and Phillips

Phillips up front in the unbearable heat. The sun is low.
He’s watching Musi, pacing. Elmi is on the sat phone...
ELMI (INTO LIFEBOAT RADIO, SUBTITLED)
Come in Hufan... Come in.
(to Musi)
There’s no answer!
Try again!

MUSI (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)
ELMI (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)
Hufan. Where are you? Do you read?
NAJEE (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)
Where is he?
MUSI (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)
I don’t know.
Musi looks like hell - his hand spasming, eyes bloodshot,
wincing as if fighting the need to throw up. He continually
moves from the bridge, where he checks a small COMPASS, to
the rear, where he checks on the Bainbridge.
PHILLIPS
Can I talk to you?
Musi, not interested, walks away. Tries that SAT-PHONE again.
Pacing.
PHILLIPS (CONT'D)
Need to talk to you.

90.
Musi ignores him again. Dialing. Pacing. His SAT-PHONE call
again fails. That frustrates him.
This time, Phillips stands in his way.
PHILLIPS (CONT'D)
Captain. It’s important.
Ballsy move - and it has gotten everyone’s attention.
So? Talk.
Alone.

MUSI
PHILLIPS

Musi pauses, curious. Phillips isn’t retracting it.
Musi nods to Najee and Bilal, “Move.” Najee pissed about it.
Then Musi sits - a measure of privacy:
PHILLIPS (CONT’D)
I had a crazy Captain once, liked
to call himself Polar Bear. Polar
Bear had this thing about radar he didn’t believe in it. Didn’t put
much stock in weather advisories
either. Twenty sources could tell
him there was a STORM out there,
but unless Polar Bear felt it on
the ends of his mustache, he just
wouldn’t believe it was true. So we
got bulletins about a Nor’Easter, a
big one - and Polar Bear sailed
right into it.
(Musi, waiting...)
Ship nearly snapped in half. We
lost half our cargo containers over
the side. And Polar Bear wound up
with a broken pelvis after a whole
refrigeration unit fell on him.
MUSI
Why you telling me this?
PHILLIPS
‘Cause what’s outside this hatch,
that’s the storm. And all the calls
on this Sat-Phone, that’s you
touching your mustache instead of
doing something about it.
Musi didn’t appreciate that, but he can’t ignore it.
MUSI
You don’t know shit.

91.
PHILLIPS
I know your man’s not coming. And
that you know it too. He’s not
about to take on a Navy destroyer.
MUSI
What? Navy not gonna hurt us,
Irish. I work for those guys!
Oh yeah?

PHILLIPS

MUSI
Sure! This is a training mission!
Do 'em all the time. We take ships,
see how the Navy does. Your company
hired us. Navy guys and me, we're
friends!
He just sounded crazy - even to him. Phillips waits - then:
PHILLIPS
Let’s stop the bullshit, o.k.? I’m
speaking to you Captain to Captain-MUSI
You not Captain of nothing anymore!
I’m-PHILLIPS
You keep thinking this is about us.
It’s isn’t.
(re: Bainbridge)
That’s the US Navy. They’re not
gonna let you win. They can’t.
They’d rather sink this boat and
tell the world I died in a
firefight than let you take me back
to Somalia.
The truth of this registers. But Musi won’t acknowledge it.
And a wave of sickness hits him - hard. He chokes it back...
PHILLIPS (CONT’D)
And you’ve got a crew-member...
(he points at Najee)
...who’s gonna give them a reason
to do it. You don’t rein him in,
he’s gonna get us all killed.
Musi overwhelmed. Suddenly, the wave of sickness hits again.
He pitches forward... and vomits on to the floor.
The other three watch in silence as Musi retches - trying to
keep a bravado face. But he doesn’t look much like a Captain.
Bilal is spinning. Elmi’s struggling with the wheel. Najee,
gun in hand, glaring at Musi with disdain.

92.
And Phillips now knows: I have to get out of here. Soon. He
looks to the hatch, which seems a hundred miles away.
PHILLIPS (CONT’D)
I need to take a leak.
MUSI

Bilal.
Bilal picks up his gun, and escorts Phillips to the back.

can’t, not with Bilal standing here - so:
PHILLIPS
You could jump in, ya know.
(Bilal eyes him)
Salt water'd be good for your foot.
Bilal, trying to read that. So Phillips makes it clear:
PHILLIPS (CONT'D)
And your captain is leading you to
some very bad places...
Bilal is smart enough to know Phillips is right. So he’s
leaning; we can feel it. Phillips can feel it too. He might
just have this kid. Bilal, weighing it all... Then:
BILAL

Najee! Come quickly!

But there, lit up like a distant jewel, is the Bainbridge.

Phillips sucks in air, and DIVES down. Even underwater he can
hear the pirates shouting.
Swimming, kicking, desperate - up for a stolen breath of air the sound of the LIFEBOAT BEARING DOWN ON HIM NOW-Back down again, trying to move faster. Through the water, he
see FLARES FROM THE BAINBRIDGE LIGHT UP THE SKY -- Phillips
just keeps swimming, his lungs aching for air... Then:
The lifeboat passes over him, and STOPS, idling right atop

cables, with parachutes attached.

But there's a lit ALTIMETER on our wrist, counting down...
700 feet, 600... Our CHUTE above us. Then the RHIB hits water
below us. A huge SPLASH. We keep plummeting, down...
Then... a BIGGER SPLASH. That's us, submerging powerfully,
water all around us... then coming up again, to find:
16 men in synchronized action, SEALS leaving their chutes to
sink in the water and boarding the RHIB. The C-17 long gone.
And in the distance the Bainbridge, ready to retrieve them.

NAJEE (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)

They think we won’t kill him,
they’ll never give us the money.
And now they’re about to start trading punches. Bilal and
Elmi having NO idea what to do. Musi shoves Najee - but:

...OVERHEAD - a SOUND approaches - in a hurry.
It’s a CHOPPER, coming at us. Musi moves to a hatch:

But before he can get there, the lifeboat begins to SPIN IN A

Spinning in circles. Phillips trying to get up off the floor
as Musi finally GRABS THE RADIO, and:
MUSI (INTO LIFEBOAT RADIO)
You don’t give the orders!
(at Elmi, SUBTITLED)
Keep going!
Everything feels crazy now: Elmi trying to gun the boat
forward - as Najee, unsolicited, grabs Phillips and starts to
pull him toward the hatch. Musi, spinning, calls out:
MUSI (SOMALI, SUBTITLED) (CONT’D)
What are you doing?
(Najee doesn’t answer)
Najee! Alive!
Najee pulls Phillips out:

conscious, as he struggles to see:
Musi picking up the radio. We hear that thin RINGING, over:
MUSI (INTO RADIO)
Okay. We gonna kill the hostage
now. Need a bodybag over here.
He barks an order in Somali. Najee and Bilal pull an ORANGE
SURVIVAL SUIT from a bin, and spread it on the floor. Musi
loads a 9mm gun.
MUSI (INTO LIFEBOAT RADIO) (CONT'D)
I got the gun. Say goodbye. Out.
He tosses the radio, marches at Phillips, yanks him to his
feet, rage in his eyes. Game over. Phillips knows it.
PHILLIPS
I thought you were all just
fishermen.
The gun comes up. Musi and Phillips are eye to eye. We
tighten on Phillips.

You’re getting low on fuel, right?
And we’ve got some weather coming

tow out to the exchange point. But
we need someone to come aboard so
we can work out the logistics.
BILAL (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)
I can't get the phone to work.
SEAL COMMANDER (THRU LIFEBOAT RADIO)
Nour Najee. Why don’t you bring him
with you? You can both clean up and
rest. You’d still have two men to
guard your prisoner.
NAJEE (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)

Phillips stares out a tiny window at the sea.
We can guess what he’s thinking: maybe how he got here, how
far he is from home, how badly he wants to get back. Then:
He turns. Here’s Musi, the only pirate awake. He looks sick,
feverish.
It’s just the two of them now, their voices low:
MUSI
Got elders coming in. Money coming
in. I gotta go on the Navy boat.
He doesn’t look totally convinced.
PHILLIPS
(interrupting)
It’s a ship.
Huh?

MUSI

105.
PHILLIPS
The Bainbridge, it’s a ship. A boat
is something like this, something
you can carry on a ship. Navy guys
hate it when you call their ship a
boat.
Musi eyes him - do you ever stop fighting? Phillips shrugs.
MUSI
This was all supposed to be easy,
you know? Hostage. Ransom.
Insurance. Easy. Nobody hurt.
PHILLIPS
You had thirty thousand and a
lifeboat. But you wanted more.
MUSI
I got bosses. They got rules.
Phillips gets that, utterly. It hovers, until:
PHILLIPS
(re: Najee)
You go. That mean he’s in charge?
MUSI
Najee.
(Musi puts finger to his
head.)
Grew up away from the water. Knew
guns before he knew sailing. All
the inland guys crazy.
PHILLIPS
Then how ‘bout you take him with
you? ‘Cause my wife’s expecting me
to live through all this. And
she’ll kill me if I don’t.
Musi almost smiles. Almost. Two sailors...
MUSI
I go. He stay.
(Phillips expected that.
He waits. Then at last)
I was out there, my AK on the deck.
How come you don’t just pick it up
and shoot everybody?
Phillips pauses. Truth is, he’s asked himself that...
MUSI (CONT’D)
Gun right there. Why you don’t just
shoot us?

106.
PHILLIPS
I didn’t want to kill anybody. I
just wanted to go home.
MUSI
I don’t wanna kill nobody either.
Just doing my job, same as you.
PHILLIPS
There’s gotta be something between
fishing and kidnapping people.
MUSI
Maybe in America, Irish.

He GRABS THE CLIPBOARD FROM PHILLIPS.
Phillips springs forward - all of his anger suddenly
unleashed - and charges into Najee from behind. Tackles him.
Bilal paralyzed by the speed of it.
Elmi cranes his head down to see the fight: Phillips clawing

Phillips folds up in half. Najee charges.
But Phillips gets UP again, pushing Najee away.

Najee moves in now. Phillips can’t turn to fight back.

Najee grabs at Phillips’ hands... Phillips resists - tucking
his fists under his chin, and keeping them there.
Najee hits Phillips brutally - but Phillips won’t relent,
just keeps his fists balled under his chin - his last act of
defiance. Bilal pulls at them too. They aren’t moving.

There’s the SAT-PHONE. He reaches for it.
...until, suddenly, his hand stops. Just frozen.
And something hits him like a wave - a sudden surge of grief,
terror, pain, frustration, all at once. Everything he didn’t
exhibit for the last five days, now smacking him in the face.
He begins to cry - out of nowhere - a shock to him. He tries
to hold it back, but can’t. Just too much in there.
We leave him here, sobbing - and DISSOLVE TO:

Before he can take another step, he hears:

ANDREA (O.S.)

Phillips looks up... to see Andrea, boarding the plane. Dan
and their daughter MARIAH behind her. The hell of THEIR last
five days written on their faces.
Phillips freezes. A beat... then:
ANDREA (CONT'D)
What were you thinking getting on
that lifeboat?
Phillips doesn’t reply - he can’t. Just drops his bags and
walks down the aisle of the plane, fast as he can, until:
He reaches her, grabs her, pulls her in tight.
The kids join in too. Everybody trying not to cry - just a
family hanging on until:
PHILLIPS
Let’s go home.

Andrea nods. Dan grabs Phillips’ bags. They move to the door.
But Phillips pauses - stops Dan... and pulls him in close.
The kid gives into it, shuts his eyes. Outside, the CHEERS of

But it’s just noise. We stay with Phillips, then CUT TO:

RICHARD PHILLIPS lies on the floor, his hands bound. He's 50,
a career sailor, now a hostage, just took a terrible beating.
His captors are four Somali pirates: BILAL, 16, his left foot
wrapped in bloody gauze; NAJEE, 24, pointing his AK-47 at us.
ELMI, 25, is up front at the helm.
Their leader is MUSI, around 20, rail-thin, his hand bandaged
and bloody. He shouts into the RADIO; but we just hear that
thin ringing, until finally his words become clear:

MUSI (INTO LIFEBOAT RADIO)
Okay. We gonna kill the hostage
now. Need a bodybag over here.

Musi (a pirate, roughly 20) hurrying past hostage pens, a
brothel, a man with one hand, a goat sipping at a puddle and
young women selling bunches of KHAT LEAVES, the ubiquitous
drug chewed by most Somalis.
In the distance a glimpse of the ocean.

What is this bullshit? - you bring
me small ships. Now I have to feed
these hostages and no-one wants to
pay a ransom.
