INT. VAULT, TRES CRUCES SAVINGS & LOAN - DAY
A wall of identical safe deposit boxes... A black valise
crammed with money... A FERRET-NOSED man, JULIO by name, puts
the cash-filled valise into a box, flips the lid shut... The
box is returned to its slot... A key locks the box door...
INT. TRES CRUCES SAVINGS & LOAN - DAY
ROBERT “BOBBY” TRENCH, aka “Bobby T,” aka “Bobby B,” aka
“Bobby Beans,” (Late 30s, taciturn) studies a BULLET HOLE in
a Victorian marble column. A scar of long ago violence.
Behind Bobby, Ferret Nose emerges from the vault. Bobby
hides his face as Ferret Nose crosses behind him and exits.
MS. YOUNG (early 20s and perky) approaches.
MS. YOUNG
Admiring our bullet hole? Billy
the Kid put that there during a
robbery in 1880.
BOBBY
How much did he get away with?
MS. YOUNG
The vault was locked for the day.
Sheriff did shoot two of Billy’s
men on the front steps though.

Ms. Young chatters, but Bobby isn’t listening.
staring at the wall of safe deposit boxes.
MS. YOUNG
Your box will be available any time
from an hour after opening to 30
minutes before close. Also if you
open a checking account, we’ll give
you 5% off the box along with free
overdraft protection.
BOBBY
And here I was hoping for a free
toaster.
MS. YOUNG
Why would a bank give out toasters?

INT. DINER - SAME
MARK “STIG” STIGMAN (no aka’s, a manic ball of forward
leaning energy) sits looking out at the sleepy main drag of
Tres Cruces. Specifically at the entrance of the Tres Cruces
S & L where Ferret Nose climbs into a car with two other
rough characters and drives off.
A WAITRESS idles at Stig’s table.
STIG (INTO PHONE)
I’m ordering you the french toast.
BOBBY (ON PHONE)
No, Ma, nothing important.
STIG (INTO PHONE)
Our very patient waitress, Maggie -at least it says Maggie on her name
tag -- has poured me four cups of
coffee. If I don’t order at this
point, it’s just rude.
WAITRESS
I can come back.
STIG (INTO PHONE)
I’m making an executive decision.
Pancakes.
OUT THE WINDOW - CAMERA finds Bobby emerging from the bank,
striding toward the diner.
BOBBY (ON PHONE)
No, no pancakes. I hate pancakes.
STIG (INTO PHONE)
What are you a communist?
(to the Waitress)
I’ll have the hash and my friend’ll
have the pancakes with a fried egg.
BOBBY (ON PHONE)
If she brings me eggs and pancakes,
I will kick your ass.
STIG (INTO PHONE)
You need to eat breakfast. It’s
the most important meal of the day.
DOOR CHIMES jingle as Bobby marches in.

BOBBY
Ignore everything he’s said. If
you’ll just bring me an O.J.,
that’d be great.
STIG
Bring him coffee and toast too.
As the waitress retreats, Stig gives her a big wink.
BOBBY
Why do you have to do that?
Do what?

STIG

BOBBY
Wink at the waitress. You hang her
up for five minutes then give her a
creepy wink like you’re gonna ask
her to take a ride in your Camaro.
STIG
Hey, waitresses like me.
BOBBY
Nobody likes you.
STIG
I’m a likable guy. I’m a good
tipper. So. The bank?
The bank.

BOBBY

As Bobby talks we flash to IMAGES of:
INT. TRES CRUCES SAVINGS & LOAN - M.O.S. - EARLIER
Bobby surveys the bank as Ms. Young leads him back to the
vault. The bank is old-fashioned in its architecture but
modern in its security features. In sync with the V.O. Bobby
notes the cameras, position of the guard, alarm buttons, etc.
BOBBY (V.O. - CONT. FROM PREVIOUS)
4 tellers, 1 guard. Bulletproof
glass, multiple security cameras.
The manager’s office is between the
tellers and the vault so we’ll have
to hope we catch him on the floor.
Beyond that the safe deposit boxes
are just sitting there.

Greeting the staff by name, the deputies settle in at the
counter and help themselves to the display of jelly donuts.
The waitress returns with Bobby’s O.J. and coffee for Stig.
WAITRESS
I’ll be right back with your hash.
STIG
Wait. Maggie. Your jelly donuts,
are they any good?
WAITRESS
Best in three counties.
STIG

Stig flashes three fingers to the waitress as she retreats.
A beat. Without preamble, Stig jumps to his feet.
STIG
Gotta shake the weasel.
As Stig vanishes into the back, one of the cops throws a
glance Bobby’s way. Bobby gives the cop a flat look back.
The waitress returns with Stig’s hash and the donuts.
BOBBY
I apologize for my friend. He was
kicked in the head as a child.
WAITRESS
Oh, he’s not that bad.
No.

BOBBY
He is.

Stig returns.

Without sitting, he digs out a donut.

STIG
Mmm, these are good.

We should go.

BOBBY
Your food just got here.
Stig flicks his eyes at the cops.
BOBBY (CONT’D)
You didn’t?
STIG
You ever hear the saying “never rob
a bank across from a diner with the
best donuts in three counties?”
Bobby stands and tosses cash on the table. Behind the
counter SMOKE begins to curl out of the kitchen.
STIG (CONT’D)
That’s all you’re gonna leave for a
tip?
BOBBY
You are a complete lunatic, you
know that?
STIG
You gotta leave at least 30%. The
woman’s about to be out of a job.
The tendrils swell becoming flames as the kitchen is engulfed
in a roaring grease fire.
BOBBY
(tossing down another $10)
This, this is why nobody likes you.
EXT. DINER - CONTINUOUS
Bobby and Stig saunter out the door and back to their car.
Behind them smoke billows. Chaos. Shouts. Alarms. Patrons
and wait-staff flee. A FIREBALL blows out the windows.

A private kingdom in the Sonora desert. Ancient stone walls.
Adobe buildings. Vaqueros on horseback work EXPANSIVE
LIVESTOCK PENS.
FIND Bobby and Stig speeding along. Past BARNS that house
not just cattle but processing areas for cocaine and heroin.
Past a DIRT AIRSTRIP where bales of marijuanas are being
loaded onto a piper cub. Up to the MAIN HOUSE where a rowdy
barbecue is underway. Half a cow on a spit. Narco corridos
on the stereo. No bling, no bimbos in mini skirts. Just
hard men eating, drinking and slinging dominos.
Bobby and Stig are greeted by RUDY (knife-scarred and wily).
Rudy shakes hands with Bobby. Stig, he ignores.
RUDY
Papi’s down in the stables.
BOBBY
Go get something to eat.
STIG
I’m not hungry.
BOBBY
Stig, you and I are here to do
business. Diplomatically. If
closing this deal involved shooting
the wings off a fly while driving
on two wheels through a ring of
fire, I’d be the one getting
something to eat.
STIG
I can be diplomatic.
A glare from Bobby.

Stig goes.

Reluctantly.

INT. STABLES, GRECO RANCH - DAY
Bobby, toting a duffle, is lead inside and down into a
network of ancient tunnels that run beneath the ranch.

INT. TUNNELS - CONTINUOUS
Rudy pauses at an antechamber and motions for Bobby to wait.
Nearby savage LAUGHTER erupts from a group of MEAN CHARACTERS
who are taking turns peeking inside a bowling ball bag.
MEAN #1 (OSCAR) holds the bag toward Bobby. Wanna see?
Bobby shrugs. Oscar comes over. And with great flare snaps
the bag open under Bobby’s nose.
We see nothing more than a wisp of hair, but the half-flinch
in Bobby’s expression is enough to tell us there’s a human
head inside. Oscar and the others CACKLE.
Returning, Rudy shoos the toughs and waves Bobby on.
INT. VAULTED CHAMBER BELOW THE STABLES, GRECO RANCH - DAY
Seated on a wooden crate MANUEL “PAPI” GRECO (a man of earth
and blood) plucks the feathers from a duck carcass. Looming
in the corner is Ferret-Nose Julio from the bank.
PAPI GRECO
“I-know-a-guy” Bobby. Quick: an
ostrich, a tank of ether, and a ‘55
Thunderbird.
BOBBY
Will you take a ‘56?
PAPI GRECO
In El Paso by Wednesday?
BOBBY
I know a guy.
Papi finds this game a chuckle. He squishes his fingers into
the flesh of the duck and digs out three pellets of buckshot.
BOBBY (CONT’D)
Not for nothing, but who’s the head
in the bag?
My cousin.

PAPI GRECO

BOBBY
Little Toro?

PAPI GRECO
Julio caught him skimming. Not that
I blame Little Toro. Everybody skims
a little cream, it’s human nature.
But just ‘cuz it’s human, don’t mean
you let it go.
Papi takes a hatchet - THWACK - chops off the duck’s head.
PAPI GRECO (CONT’D)
That for me?
Bobby pulls a shiny new CHAINSAW from his duffle.
BOBBY
The gas-powered MS 270. Throttle
trigger interlock, bumper spikes,
quickstop chain-brake.
Setting aside the duck, Papi comes over to examine his new
toy. Bobby sets a protective hand on the saw.
BOBBY (CONT’D)
Where’s my present?
Papi motions to Ferret-Nosed Julio who tosses Bobby a
satchel. Inside are 200 blank passports and 400 blank social
security cards. Bobby examines them. His expression sours.
BOBBY (CONT’D)
These are garbage.
PAPI GRECO
They’re what I got.
BOBBY
If I take these, I’m telling you I
don’t know my business, and I know
my business.
A sudden air of menace hangs.

Papi’s boys glower.

PAPI GRECO
You too good for my product?
BOBBY
I’m saying anyone who’d take these
is stupid, desperate, or looking to
put you in jail. Which one you
think I am?
A beat.

Papi looks to his boys.

Then shrugs/smirks.

PAPI GRECO
It’s not just you. After Little
Toro we’re running everybody
through the blender. If it soothes
your ego, I’ll give you 39,000 for
the ‘56 Thunderbird. Assuming it’s
mint.
THWACK - Papi chops off the duck’s feet.
EXT. NEAR THE STABLES, GRECO RANCH - DAY
Four ROUGHNECKS shoot at a line of chickens buried up to
their necks in the dirt. Bets are traded. A bottle is
passed. Stig sits nearby finishing a plate of barbecue.
STIG
That’s not very sporting. What
chance are you giving the chickens?
The roughnecks trade scornful remarks in Spanish and return
to their game. Stig hurls a leg bone at them. They stop.
They glare.
STIG (CONT’D)
If I’m gonna kill a defenseless
animal, I’m gonna honor its
sacrifice by grilling it up into
some tasty barbecue. What I’m not
gonna do, is torture it just to
prove I’m a crappy shot who can’t
hit anything further away than his
own pecker.
OVER BY THE STABLES Rudy walks Bobby back out into the harsh Mexican sunlight.
They spot Stig jousting with the roughnecks.
RUDY
Looks like your junkyard dog’s off
the chain again.
Bobby grumbles/sighs and marches over to Stig.

BOBBY
What are you doing?
STIG
They’re torturing those chickens.
A roughneck curses at Stig in Spanish.
STIG (CONT’D)
Say that in English, monkey boy.
BOBBY
Stig. Look at me. You see that
bag on the buffet table?
Bobby points over at the barbecue/party where the men with
the bowling ball bag have joined the others.
STIG
Between the ribs and the potato
salad?
BOBBY
There’s a human head inside.
STIG
Aw, sonofa... That is uncool; that
is not cool.
The roughnecks mutter Spanish curses.
Bobby grabs Stig. Stig calms.

Stig lunges at them.

STIG (CONT’D)
It’s all right. I’m all right.
Stig and Bobby turn to go. Behind them the roughnecks
CHUCKLE. That tears it. In one seamless motion Stig whips
around and shoots the heads off all five chickens.
EXT. GRECO RANCH - DAY
Bobby and Stig walk back across the ranch to their car.
STIG
I hate Mexico. I hate the dust, I
hate the desert, I hate the beer.
BOBBY
I’m sure it hates you back.
STIG
You don’t think Papi suspects?

BOBBY
If Papi knew we were planning to
rip him off, it’d be our heads in
that bag by the potato salad.
STIG
Nah, our two heads’d never fit in a
bag that small.
EXT. U.S./MEXICO BORDER - DAY
The colossal border jam up. Car and buses and smoke belching
trucks await inspection. Lines of day laborers cross on
foot, ready to work hard. If they can find work, that is.
Bobby and Stig sit in their non-moving car in the non-moving
line. Bobby looks into the station wagon beside them. 5
Mexican house painters with sun-creased faces look back.
STIG
Papi’s guy delivers a briefcase
full of money to that bank every
two weeks. At that rate he’s gotta
have, what, two mil stashed there?
BOBBY
Math sounds right.
STIG
What happens if we get caught?
BOBBY
If we get caught, it’ll be your
fault and I’ll kill you.
STIG
Sure, whatever, but say we do? And
say Papi Greco mangles my corpse,
runs it through a sawmill,
something like that, would you come
after him?
Nope.

BOBBY

STIG
You wouldn’t kill him? Because if
he did that to you I’d kill him.
BOBBY
Then you’re an idiot.

9/15/09

2guns

12.

STIG
You know why I’d kill him, because
you’re my people and there’s a code.
BOBBY
First up: there is no code. You do
what you have to do. The rest is
just stuff that makes you stupid.
STIG
And second?
(a look from Bobby)
Right. We’re not “people.”
Because you, you don’t have people.
Bingo.

Bobby and Stig roll up to the inspection booth.
BORDER GUARD
Purpose for you visit to Mexico?
BOBBY
Quail hunting.
STIG
My aunt in Tuba City had a heart
attack so we cut our trip short.

The guard considers Bobby and Stig. Considers their
documents. Then retreats inside the shack.
Tuba City?

BOBBY

STIG
It’s near Odessa.
BOBBY
Nice place?
STIG
Hell hole but she is my favorite
aunt.
A sudden commotion. Boots. Guns. Swarming men in kevlar.
Before Bobby and Stig can react their car is surrounded by 15
armed border agents. M-16s leveled, fingers on triggers.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

(driven, but not without a sense of humor) observes.
UNIFORMED AGENT
Tell Agent Rees about Papi Greco.
STIG

Who?
Papi.

DEB
Greco.

STIG
He some kind of Mexican Santa
Claus?
DEB
I didn’t fall off the turnip truck,
Mr. Stigman and my roots aren’t
blonde so how ‘bout you stop
playing the stupid card?
STIG
No ma’am. It’s my intent to
cooperate with whatever you need.
As an American, I know you’re just
doing your job and sometimes
innocent folks like me get caught
up in the system. It’s like with
the airlines. They didn’t lose
your bag on purpose, but everybody
takes it so personal. I bet you
two see a lot of frowning faces.
Stig winks at Deb.

Deb rolls her eyes and exits.

INT. INTERVIEW ROOM, NUMBER 2 - DAY

BOBBY

Hard-Case bristles. Jessup puts a hand on his shoulder and
nods for Hard-Case to step out. Hard-Case goes. A beat.
JESSUP
Five border agents are ripping
apart your car as we speak.
BOBBY
They’re not gonna find anything.
JESSUP
Where’d you hide the passports?
BOBBY
There are no passports.
JESSUP
What are you talking about? The deal
was in place. A hand to hand buy
from Papi Greco for 200 passports.
BOBBY
I turned them down.
(off Jessup’s disbelief)
They were third rate crap.
Deb enters.
DEB
Your pal, Stig’s a piece of work.
BOBBY
He winked at you, didn’t he?
JESSUP
Bobby rejected the passports.

BOBBY
Papi was testing me. If I’d taken
the passports, I’d never have
gotten off the ranch alive.
JESSUP
You sure about that?
BOBBY
Don’t insult me. I’ve got four
years in on this. I have waded
through sewage. I had a bag with a
human head in it shoved under my
nose, okay?
JESSUP
I know. I know all you’ve been
through and I know how you’ve had
to give your life over to playing
the part of Bobby Beans.
BOBBY
I can get Papi Greco. I have an
angle. The only trick is I need
you to let me rob the Tres Cruces
Savings & Loan.
JESSUP
You want to rob a bank?
BOBBY
No. Stig wants to rob the bank.
It was his idea, he approached me,
no entrapment. What I want is for
you to help me stop him, just not
until he’s accessed the safe
deposit boxes.
JESSUP
And just why does “Stig” want to
break into the safe deposit boxes?
BOBBY
Because Papi Greco has two million
dollars stashed there, and if we
can access the money -- like if it
was evidence in a failed robbery -we can nail him for unreported tax
evasion and possibly RICO.
DEB
What happens to Stig?

BOBBY
He takes it hard on a class B
felony, does 20 years like a good
fish. Who cares?
JESSUP
I’m not going to like the answer,
but why not just get a warrant?
BOBBY
We can’t. I can’t prove how I know
what I know. At least not in open
court.
JESSUP
Because how you know it is in
violation of the rules of evidence?
BOBBY
Don’t ask / don’t tell.
No.

JESSUP

DEB
If it’ll get us our man...
JESSUP
It’s suborning felony robbery.
BOBBY
It’s only felony robbery if I get
away with the money.
JESSUP
There are rules to what we do,
Agent Trench. They stink and
they’re awkward, but they’re the
rules we’ve agreed to play by.
Bobby scoffs/burns.
BOBBY
You can’t fight an avalanche with a
teaspoon.

Maybe we can’t. But we’re sure
gonna dig like hell.

Stig reaches into his belt, pulls out a knife.
STIG
Are you playing me? ‘Cuz if I

your side, I’d think you weren’t

A bland unit in a bland development. Bobby enters. Silence,

Papi Greco steps over Bobby. With Papi are Rudy and FerretNose Julio.
PAPI GRECO
I miss old fashion phone books.
Policeman’s best friend, right?
But then you’d know. Because you
are an undercover agent of the DEA.
Rudy and Julio hoist Bobby up. Papi slams the phone book

The only thing DEA hates more than
drug dealers is crooked agents.

I wouldn’t take the elevator.
Bobby turns for the stairs.

Wouldn’t do the stairs either.
There’s a goon named Mini on the

Nowhere to go, Bobby retreats back into the apartment.

Did I kill you? I could’ve killed
you. In fact if I had killed you I

STIG’S POV - Quince and Teemo step off the elevator.
STIG (CONT’D)
Oh, boy. Three bogies right
outside the door. Your best chance
is to head for the back bathroom.
Ignoring Stig, Bobby hides behind the couch.
STIG (CONT’D)
What are you doing? That’s a

The door kicks open. The SEALs burst in. Bobby holds tight.
Quince signals Teemo and Mini to disperse about the loft.

Okay, we’ll do this the hard way.

Bobby moves quick and low. Thanks to Stig’s timing the SEALs
are all looking other directions.
STIG (CONT’D)
Next stop, around the bookshelf and
beneath the bed... Go.
Per Stig’s instruction, Bobby darts around the right side of
the bookshelf just as Quince comes the other direction around
the left side. Diving under the bed, Bobby just misses
getting spotted by Teemo.

Okay. Roll right, crawl into the

You’re just mad ‘cuz you thought

Bobby starts to get out of the tub.
STIG (CONT’D)
Wait, not yet.
Bobby waits.

Quince passes by the open doorway.

Why you? You were perfect. You

run rogue ops?

The Admiral taught me duty, honor,

He may be a two-faced S.O.B. but
the values weren’t wrong. I went
into that bank because I believed
we had a debt to the men we’d left

Stig and Bobby wade in with the others. The water quickly

knock them off their feet.
One of the immigrant men slips, then surfaces with a splash
of flailing limbs. He can’t swim.
The other immigrants hustle out of the river and up the bank,

IN THE PLANE Stig drops the Cessna so that its wheels scrape the ground.
STIG
You sure you don’t want me to pull
up?
BOBBY
Absolutely.
Cool.

STIG

Plane and SUV hurtle at each other. 50 yards... 25... 10...
Deb jerks the wheel. The SUV fishtails. The Cessna T-bones
the SUV. The SUV barrel rolls. The plane goes ass-overteakettle.
Then silence. The SUV lays on its side, tires still
spinning. The plane sits inverted on its back.
INSIDE THE PLANE - Bobby and Stig hang upsidedown. Bobby
claws at his belt release. Drops with a groan-inducing thud.
STIG (CONT’D)
(groggy)
Well, that was a hoot.
BOBBY
You all right?

Busted rib, maybe.
Stig pulls at his belts.

Jammed.

Bobby looks over at the overturned SUV.

Go on.

The fate of its

STIG (CONT’D)
I’m cool.

Bobby shimmies out of the plane. Gun drawn, he side steps
toward the SUV. The SUV’s engine hisses... The tires spin...
Bobby swings around the nose and levels his pistol through
the fractured windshield at... Mini’s dead body.
A pistol jabs against the back of Bobby’s neck. It’s the
Admiral, his face bloody, his right leg dragging awkwardly.
Stig?

BOBBY

ADMIRAL
Drop the pistol.
BOBBY
Stig, I kinda need your help here.
Stig, who has dragged himself free of the plane, sees the
Admiral with a gun to Bobby’s neck and snap draws his own.
The Admiral pulls Bobby tight in front of him as a shield.
ADMIRAL
Don’t do it, sailor.
Do it.

BOBBY
Shoot him.

Stig considers the narrow angle he has on the Admiral.
STIG
I don’t know. It’s tight.
BOBBY
You won’t miss.
STIG
I could miss.
Rising up from a ditch, Deb levels her gun at Stig.

9/15/09

Drop the gun.

DEB

114.

Aw, crap.

STIG

DEB
I’ll shoot you where you
stand.

BOBBY
Take the shot.

ADMIRAL
She said to lay down the
weapon.

STIG
She’s kinda got a gun pointed
at me.

Fine.

BOBBY
I got yours.

You got mine.

STIG
If you miss and I get shot...
ADMIRAL
I’m gonna count to three.

One.

BLAM-BLAM - Stig and Bobby both fire. Bobby hits Deb in the
chest. Stig puts his through the Admiral’s eye.
Bobby crosses to Deb who is rapidly bleeding out.
DEB
Say something nice.
BOBBY
You always had a beautiful neck.
Deb dies.
Nearby Stig stands over the Admiral’s body.

Bobby joins him.

STIG
Think they’ll give him a full honor
guard?
BOBBY
Of course they will. There’s no
way they’ll admit the truth.
STIG
Well, that sucks.
The remaining CIA helo, its gun cannon locked on, glides out
of the dawn and alights. Earl and the boys climb out. Earl
motions to retrieve the money from the overturned SUV.
EARL
You won’t mind if we take back what
was ours all along.

BOBBY
Would it matter if we did?
THICK
(aside to Earl)
You’re just gonna let them go?
EARL
We have the money. The people who
conspired to steal it are dead.
We’ve got no further business with
these gentlemen.
BOBBY
What about the warrants for our
arrest?
EARL
A misunderstanding.
STIG
Both our names are clear?
EARL
I trust you’ll find your own way
home?
With that Earl climbs back into the helicopter and flies off.
What now?

STIG

Bobby cross to Deb’s body.
Tosses it to Stig.

Takes the 400k out of her jacket.

BOBBY
For Mama Maybelle.
Thanks.

STIG

BOBBY
There is one more thing.
Bobby gives Stig a look.
STIG
Aw, you’re not serious?
BOBBY
Leg or arm?

You’re really gonna do this?
BOBBY
Looks like we’re gonna have to walk
out of here, so I’m thinking arm.
STIG
You are a petty, vindictive sonofa-Bobby shoots Stig in the arm.
Ow!

STIG (CONT’D)
Motherless-goat-sucking...

BOBBY
Hurts, don’t it?
INT. MAMA MABELLE’S DINER - DAY
Mama opens a brown wrapped packet. Inside is the $400k and a
photo of her son in his dress uniform. On the back of the
photo is a note: “A pitiful token in honor of your loss.”
On Maybelle.

Moved.

INT. BANK VAULT, 1ST STATE BANK OF CENTERVILLE - DAY
A long line of cash crammed safe deposit boxes. How much
cash? Say 81.53 million? Earl flips the boxes shut. Slides
them into their wall slots. Locks the doors.
EXT. 1ST STATE BANK OF CENTERVILLE - DAY
Centerville, Iowa is a placid mid-western small town.
Exiting the bank Earl gets in a car with Mr. Lean.
ACROSS THE TOWN SQUARE - at a window table in the CENTERVILLE
DINER are Bobby and Stig.
INT. CENTERVILLE DINER - SAME
Stig, his arm in a sling, scans the menu as Bobby watches
Earl drive off.
STIG
I saw some nice looking blueberry
pancakes go by.

BOBBY
When have I ever ordered pancakes?
STIG
There’s always hope.
The waitress, MARGIE, approaches.
MARGIE THE WAITRESS
What can I get you, boys?
STIG
Well, Margie, I was looking over
the menu here-BOBBY
(cutting to the point)
How are your jelly donuts?
MARGIE THE WAITRESS
To tell the truth, our donuts are
kinda lousy.
BOBBY
I can’t tell you how happy we are
to hear that.
