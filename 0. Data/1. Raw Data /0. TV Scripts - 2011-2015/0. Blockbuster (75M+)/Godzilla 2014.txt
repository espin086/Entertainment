"Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds."
J. Robert Oppenheimer,
Father of the Atomic Bomb

FADE IN, gliding above the surface of a still blue ocean. It
could be a photo, nothing moves. Nature is at peace. Then.
EXT. SOUTH PACIFIC OCEAN - BIKINI LAGOON - DAY
The JAWS OF A MONSTER slice through the peaceful surf --- it is the carved wood prow of a CANOE; one of hundreds
like it, lashed together in a ceremonial flotilla, draped in
flower leis. A grand festival is in progress.
Tattooed ISLANDERS row to the rhythm of deep bass drums.
WOMEN and CHILDREN chant joyously from the pristine ATOLL
BEACH... Celebrating this life in Paradise. But slowly -AN ENORMOUS SHADOW CRYSTALLIZES UNDERWATER
The dark form of some leviathan. Women and children spot the
beast and shout from shore. But it is too late --- the whole LAGOON BEGINS TO CHURN AND BULGE as the DARK
FORM RISES... Canoes list violently and CAPSIZE, as panicked
islanders are dragged under by the maelstrom.
Then the SOURCE of the bulge reveals itself:
THE USS NAUTILUS
BREACHES the surface with a BLAST OF SPRAY. A massive,
nuclear-powered submarine. Its TOP-HATCH swings open --- and up flies a flag:
SUPERIMPOSE:

the Stars and Stripes.

BIKINI ATOLL, MARSHALL ISLANDS - 1954

EXT. BIKINI ATOLL STILT VILLAGE - SHORTLY LATER
Pandemonium, as US SAILORS storm the peaceful village,
barking broken Marshallese on megaphones... Islanders are
dragged from shanties. The tiny village is being evacuated.
EXT. SANDBAR JETTY - DAY
More hurried work. Caged “TEST ANIMALS” are off-loaded to
the shore; sheep, horses, cattle, pigs. TECHNICIANS in lab
coats prep equipment, directing the installation of -A STEEL-FRAME “DETONATION” TOWER
SHIRTLESS SAILORS hoist up a huge aluminum cylinder, then
bolt it into place: THE BOMB.

2.

A Geiger counter starts to CLACK, as a BOMB TECHNICIAN aims
its sensor out to sea... Something is coming from the ocean.
BOMB TECHNICIAN
Hurry up, hurry up!
INT. USS BAIROKO - FLAG BRIDGE - DUSK
The USS BAIROKO, an escort carrier afloat several miles away.
From here, Bikini Atoll is just a smudge on the horizon.
OFFICERS and CREW gather tensely around a SONAR SWEEP-SCREEN.
A LARGE GREEN DOT is closing in upon the Atoll.
EXT. BIKINI ATOLL - DUSK
Geiger counters are clacking faster; DIALS spike to red. The
ground RUMBLES ONCE, in the distance. Then a second time.
The caged test animals can sense what’s coming... Horses
whinny in terror, cattle snort, hogs scream in rising dread.
BOMB TECHNICIAN
Okay, let’s go, let’s go!
With the installation finished, Technicians crowd onto a
SIOUX CHOPPER. The tiny island is left deserted.
ANGLE ON THE BOMB
As its BEACON blinks from green to yellow, armed... We
notice a crudely PAINTED DECAL on its side: the shape of a
GIANT LIZARD standing in a set of cross-hairs.
SHIPBOARD SPEAKERS (V.O.)
It is now thirty seconds to zero
time, please put on goggles...

The DECK CREW straps on UV goggles...
SHIPBOARD SPEAKERS
Fifteen seconds...
A TIMER NEEDLE sweeping down -SHIPBOARD SPEAKERS
Minus ten...

EXT. BIKINI ATOLL - DUSK
The animals are going wild. Geiger counters are spiking off
the charts. The steady RUMBLES are getting louder, closer.
TINNY SPEAKERS
Fiver, four, three...
As the whole lagoon LIFTS upward with a massive swell -TINNY SPEAKERS
Two, one...
GODZILLA RISES LIKE A LIVING WATERFALL,
completely SHROUDED by a torrent of cascading surf. We can
only barely, briefly glimpse his silhouette, before -A FLASH OF BLINDING LIGHT consumes us.

Silence.

Whiteness.

Then slowly, almost gracefully, an epic MUSHROOM CLOUD
unfurls into Nature’s pure blue peaceful sky.
It is a long, strangely quiet moment before -- the BONERATTLING SHOCK-WAVE CRASHES IN, obliterating our entire POV.

Then a BLIZZARD OF ASH ENGULFS THE TITLE, as we MATCH CUT:
EXT. SIBERIAN TUNDRA - NIGHT
The whiteout of a blinding snowstorm. A UNITED NATIONS
HELICOPTER is making its way across the windswept steppe.
the distance looms a sprawling subarctic MINING CAMP.
SUPERIMPOSE:

In

KRASNOKAMENSK, SIBERIA - TEN YEARS AGO

ANGLE ON PROFESSOR HONDA (40s),
Riding in a cockpit. An austere Japanese man with a pensive,
almost brusque demeanor. He carries a small BRASS POCKET
WATCH, fiddling with it absently as he studies the horizon:
BLACK SMOKE billows to the sky.

The camp is a disaster site.

EXT. DEVASTATED MINING CAMP - NIGHT
A LOCAL RESCUE CREW is already here, scouring the wreckage:
CORRUGATED HANGARS crunched like tin cans; decimated MEGADOZERS; gigantic DRILL-BORES, snapped like twigs... At least
a dozen RECOVERED FROZEN CORPSES lay chilling in the snow.

4.

The new arrivals are a UNITED NATIONS “MUTO” RESEARCH TEAM of
international origin. Some wear uniforms with an IDENTIFYING
EMBLEM we will come to recognize. They chatter in a MULTILINGUAL BABEL as they unload SCIENTIFIC EQUIPMENT -But their leader, Honda, does not say a word. A man of
science, at once captivated and unnerved by what he sees.
INT. MINING HANGAR - NIGHT
Half the ROOF has been shorn away by violent force, giving
onto a sky of frigid wind and moonlight. An EXPERT (DR.
STABLER, 30s) leads the way with a HALIDE FLASHLIGHT.
DR. STABLER
The Russians were surveying for
uranium ore and found a radioactive
hot-spot. But when they started
drilling, it wasn’t uranium they
found... Our Geneva office got the
call this morning.
Honda follows close at hand.
Over here!

Still not a word.

RUSSIAN RESCUE WORKER (SUBTITLE)
This one is conscious!

A surviving MINER is hunkered in the corner. Bug-eyed,
catatonic, still shuddering from hypothermia and terror.
RUSSIAN RESCUE WORKER (SUBTITLE)
What was it? What did this?
But Honda silences the RESCUE WORKER, kneeling to face the
traumatized survivor. He takes the miner’s shaking hand.
RUSSIAN MINER (SUBTITLE)
(amid pained breaths)
One -- was -- alive -The miner is staring blankly at the BLOWN-OUT ENTRANCE TO A
MINE SHAFT. Repeating the same phrase over and over again.
HONDA
(to Rescue Worker)
Take us in, please.
INT. UNDERGROUND CAVERN - DAY
THREE ROPES DROP IN FROM ABOVE, as Honda and his team absail
down into a vast, hollow chamber in the earth.

5.

Several dozen RESCUE WORKERS are already here, flashlights
sporadically illuminating what seems to be a kind of giant
nest. Hardened secretion surrounds TWO ENORMOUS OVAL SPORES.
One appears to be intact. The second has already “hatched.”
Honda studies it all with measured fascination, noticing a
set of DEEP GROOVES in the rocky wall. Claw marks?
DR. STABLER
The rescue workers found it like
this. One spore is still intact.
The other, well -(indicates wreckage)
-- must have been what did this.
Cr-unch! Honda has stepped on something brittle. He
crouches to inspect the GREEN-GRAY ROCK underneath his foot.
It pulverizes to dust at the touch of a finger. Exposing:
DR. STABLER
And then there’s that.
A COLOSSAL ANIMAL BONE. Honda, eyes wide in astonishment,
slowly pivots the beam of his flashlight upwards to reveal:
THE ENTIRE CAVERN IS RIDGED WITH BONES. It is no cavern at
all. They have dug inside a GIGANTIC, HOLLOW RIB-CAGE.
EXT. HIGH ABOVE THE MINING CAMP - HELICOPTER VIEW - DUSK
Later. The EXCAVATION CREW has now arrived and is getting to
work, like so many tiny ants -- busying about the vague dark
SILHOUETTE OF A GARGANTUAN FOSSIL FROZEN UNDERNEATH THE ICE.
TWO OTHER, SMALLER SHAPES surround the LARGER ONE, entwined.
As if all THREE CREATURES WERE SOMEHOW FROZEN IN MID-BATTLE.
EXT. SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - HOKKAIDO, JAPAN - DUSK
Cherry blossoms line a quiet street of traditional Japanese
homes. In the distance, the sloped COOLING AND REACTOR
TOWERS of a nuclear power plant loom, venting steam.
SUPERIMPOSE:

SHAKOTAN PENINSULA, HOKKAIDO, JAPAN

A UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA POSTER
has been tacked up on a shoji door. The house is traditional
fusuma style. But the residents are pure gaijin, American.
As the door slides open.

LINDA
Ford?
LINDA MADDOX (40) surveys the room with a mother’s true
despair. Apart from the poster, some BATMAN COMICS and a
FOOTBALL on the bed, the rest of the room is STILL IN BOXES.
She exhales a weary sigh.
INT. MASTER BEDROOM - DUSK
NATHAN BRODY (40) is tying his necktie in the mirror,
dressing for an evening out. Or trying to. The ungainly
tangle of a knot seems to have swallowed his pinky finger.
LINDA
Have you seen Ford?
BRODY
Little help here? I think this tie
is developing a taste for flesh.
I’m more a shorts and sandals guy.
Linda ably undoes the knot.

Re-tying it as she continues.

LINDA
He isn’t in his room. I told him
he was grounded until he got those
boxes unpacked, and all he does is
put that U.C. poster on his door.
Lift your chin.
BRODY
Can you blame him? He got in.
He’s excited about college.
LINDA
No, he’s hoping all of this is
temporary.
BRODY
I get it. He’s a high-school
senior whose mom just moved him
half-way around the world to follow
some guy.
LINDA
Is that what you are?
BRODY
Give him time.

7.

LINDA
You’re a saint. Me, he hates.
She starts to thaw.

Then her eyes snap, noticing:

LINDA
(her EMPTY PURSE)
And those were my car keys.
Where’s Elle? I swear, if he took
her out again, I’ll -Just then, Brody SEES MOVEMENT OUT THE WINDOW:
STATION WAGON is backing down the driveway...

the FAMILY

As Linda’s eyes begin to dart, Brody quickly KISSES HER.
Holding it until the station wagon pulls off up the street.
As the kiss ends. Linda, on a cloud. In love. Regards him.
The necktie has fallen, untied to their feet.
BRODY
You were saying?
EXT. BRODY-MADDOX HOUSE - DUSK
The FAMILY STATION WAGON is doing wobbly figure eights up and
down the cul-de-sac, veering erratically...
FORD (PRE-LAP)
Watch it, watch it!
INT. STATION WAGON - DUSK
FORD MADDOX (17) is an all-American teen in a well-worn UC
Berkeley sweatshirt. He sits in the passenger’s seat, trying
to mind the road ahead as his little sister --- ELLE MADDOX (11), sits beneath the wheel, blind to the
road ahead. She strains her tiny feet to reach the PEDALS.
ELLE
Which one’s on the left again?
FORD
Clutch, clutch, press it!
Elle taps the gas instead.
ELLE
“Clutch-oo.”
FORD
Your other left.

The engine GRINDS AUDIBLY.

8.

ELLE
That’s how you say most stuff in
Japanese. Just put a “oo” at the
end. Like “aisu kurimu.”
FORD
Watch the road.
ELLE
That’s ice cream.
Then suddenly -FORD
Look out!
Brody has stepped out right in front of the moving car. Ford
grabs the steering wheel, swerving hard. The wagon hops a
curb and JOLTS TO A STOP. Bumper pinched against a tree.
EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DUSK
Brody barely bats an eye.

As Ford and Elle pile out.

ELLE
Woops...
FORD
(to Brody, wrists up:
“Guilty as charged”)
You can go tell mom now.
But instead, Brody pulls out his wallet, PEELS OFF A BILL and
holds it out. Ford just stands there a beat. Confused.
BRODY
(smiles)
It’s your tip. Take it.
FORD
(hesitates, suspicious)
For denting the bumper?
BRODY
For cleaning your room.
FORD
I haven’t -(then it hits him)
Oh.
BRODY
Bingo.

9.

Ford reaches for the bill -- but Brody grips it tighter.
BRODY
Plus the living room and the
dishes. Just make the house look
nice for when we get back from this
opera or ballet, or whatever it is which, I’m not gonna lie, I’d
rather stick around and watch the
ball-game... But I won’t. Because
this move has been as hard on your
mom as it has on anyone in this
family, and right now she just
needs a little love. Deal?
Ford nods, reluctantly.

Brody lets go of the bill.

INT. BRODY-MADDOX HOUSE - ENTRY - DUSK
Moments later. Ford and Elle shuffle in with Brody. Linda
has been waiting; looks up from the PORTABLE PHONE, dismayed.
LINDA
It’s the plant. I tried to tell
them we have tickets, but -BRODY
(understanding)
It’s my night on safety. Don’t
worry about it, probably a sector
reboot. We’ll stop by on the way.
He takes the phone and speaks rapidly IN JAPANESE. Gathering
his coat as Linda puts on her evening shawl. Regarding Ford.
LINDA
You still hate me?
FORD
(weakly)
No.
LINDA
Then aren’t you forgetting
something?
Ford squirms reluctantly and mutters something.
ELLE
(the peanut gallery, knows
the drill by heart)
Louder.

10.

FORD
(still barely audible)
Love you.
LINDA
(smiles)
Prove it.
Ford hugs his mother limply. Then, per-time-tried family
ritual, she watches in mock-sternness as he does the same to
Elle, who squeezes tightly. For all their faults, a family.
EXT. JANCORP NUCLEAR POWER PLANT - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT
The plant occupies a few flat hectares of oceanfront. Its
huge cooling towers billow steam above a MULTI-LINGUAL LOGO:
“JAPAN-AMERICA NUCLEAR - UNLEASHING THE POWER OF NATURE”
INT. JANCORP NUCLEAR POWER PLANT - GLASS WAITING AREA - NIGHT
A LARGE GLASS WALL gives onto the plant control room, where
uniformed ENGINEERS attend to a dizzying matrix of monitors
and dials occupying every inch of wall-space. Among them,
Brody is in evening wear. Carrying on what seems to be an
increasingly heated conversation about an on-screen readout.
Linda can hear none of it. She sits on a couch, staring up
at a FLUORESCENT CEILING LIGHT. It FLICKERS with a band-like
rolling pattern. Something about the sight unnerves her.
BRODY (O.S.)
Sorry this is taking so long -Brody has emerged from plant control.

Steps up.

BRODY
There’s been shaking in Sapporo.
An underground line went down.
Shaking?

LINDA
Is everything okay?

BRODY
Yeah. Fine. Just a couple
tremors. But you should probably
go on ahead. I’ll take a cab.
Maybe make it there by halftime?
LINDA
Intermission.

11.

Brody spreads an easy smile.

Something slightly forced?

LINDA
You sure everything’s okay?
Of course.
didn’t I?

BRODY
I designed this place,

After a beat, Linda eases. Brody pecks her on the cheek.
Then withdraws back through the GLASS DOORS, into:
INT. PLANT CONTROL - NIGHT
Brody turns his back to the glass, and instantly the man
transforms. His face a sudden mask of DEEP CONCERN.
BRODY
What’s the status on that signal?
A seated engineer (TAK) responds from a nearby station.
Studying A PATTERN OF SPIKES ON AN OSCILLOSCOPE DISPLAY.
TAK
Major magnetic interference. Same
signature as a nuclear detonation,
but Okinawa says they aren’t testing.
BRODY
How about the North Koreans?
Suddenly, the spikes shoot higher triggering a WARNING ALERT.
The engineers instantly erupt in JAPANESE. Tak, concerned.
TAK
It could be our shielding. Should
we power down the plant, sir?
A beat.

A hard decision.

Brody makes it.

BRODY
It’s gotta be an anomaly.
(a beat, resolved)
All systems go, we’ll ride it out.

No.

Brody is too busy studying the signal pattern to notice -Linda is still standing behind the large glass wall.
Watching their activity with a growing measure of concern.
Seeing her, Tak flips a switch that turns the retroreflective glass OPAQUE. Shutting Linda out.

12.

INT. VIDEO GAME ARCADE - NIGHT
A high-decibel neon maze, teeming with JAPANESE TEENAGERS.
Ford is firing a PLASTIC M-16 at the ON-SCREEN MONSTERS of a
“first-person shooter” game. Then his avatar gets stomped.
Game over. He hooks the rifle. Noticing -A GROUP OF TEENAGE JAPANESE GIRLS, giggling at him in a highpitched hormonal squeal. He smiles back. Elle notices.
ELLE
How come you don’t try learning
Japanese?
FORD
Don’t have to. Six months from
now, I’ll be in college, playing
ball and partying on weeknights.
He winks roguishly. But the teenage girls JUST GIGGLE
LOUDER. Chattering in Japanese.
ELLE
That doesn’t help you now, though.
FORD
(a beat, she’s right)
Alright, you win, gimme something.
Elle thinks a moment, then WHISPERS SOMETHING IN HIS EAR.
Ford listens, then steps over to the giggling teenage girls.
And REPEATS THE LINE ALOUD IN JAPANESE -Instantly, the giggling girls GO SILENT. Then: ONE GIRL
smacks Ford hard across the cheek. They all stalk off.
Elle doubles-over, CACKLING at her prank.
FORD
You are so dead!
He takes off RUNNING AFTER HER.
EXT. BUSY MAIN STREET - NIGHT
Ford and Elle burst out past OTHER PATRONS, laughing as they
go, until at last Ford corners Elle and pins her, tickling
furiously until she keels over to the sidewalk, LAUGHING
HERSELF TO TEARS. Neither of them noticing at first --- a SMALL PUDDLE OF WATER BUBBLING from a THIN CRACK in the
pavement. Slowly, the crack itself is SPLITTING WIDER.

13.

ELLE
(sees it, breathless)
Ford --? Wait, wait!
Then suddenly -- the GROUND RUMBLES SLIGHTLY WITH A TREMOR.
ELLE
Look!
The tiny crack is BRANCHING UP THE SIDEWALK in the direction
of the distant reactor towers. Oddly, the night sky above
the towers glows with a HAZE OF GREENISH AURORAL LIGHT.
Ford and Elle look on for a beat, transfixed. Then -- HIS
CELL PHONE BUZZES. Call from: “MOM.” Ford answers.
Ford?

LINDA (PRE-LAP)
Are you there --?

EXT. NUCLEAR POWER PLANT - NIGHT
Outside the REACTOR TOWERS. The tremor has stopped. PLANT
WORKERS glance about, then hustle off with purpose. As Linda
returns to the station wagon, on her phone. Looks anxious.
LINDA
I tried the house line.
guys okay?

Are you

EXT. BUSY MAIN STREET - NIGHT
Ford has helped Elle to her feet. Distracted by the strange
“northern lights” in the sky above the distant plant.
FORD
What? Yeah. Just stepped out into
the yard... Mom, are you still at
the plant, what’s going on?
INT. STATION WAGON - NIGHT
Linda tries to start the car.
CLICKS strangely.
LINDA
Of course, yeah.
not a big...

But the ignition REVS AND

Brody says it’s

The ignition suddenly STARTS UP WITH A REV, as her CAR KEYS
BEGIN TO CLATTER TOGETHER. As if magnetically attracted.

14.

LINDA
(unnerved)
I’m coming home.
EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT
Ford snaps to attention.

Home?

Already?

Grabs Elle.

FORD
‘Kay mom, seeya in a minute.
He starts to hang up.
LINDA (ON PHONE)
Hey.
(this stops Ford)
Aren’t you forgetting someThe word cuts off as THE LINE GOES DEAD.
FORD
Mom?
Suddenly, THE GROUND SHAKES MASSIVELY.
INT. PLANT CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT
Pandemonium. The entire matrix of control panels instantly
GOES HAYWIRE.
TAK
Lost power to reactor two!

BRODY
Shut down, shut down!

Then the entire building RUMBLES. And out the window behind
Brody -- THE GIANT REACTOR TOWERS SHIFT ON THEIR FOUNDATIONS.
EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT
Ford and Elle watch as the reactor towers on the horizon
SHIFT AGAIN, UNLEASHING A FORCEFUL SHOCK-WAVE.
FORD
MOM!
THE TOWERS DROP FROM VIEW into a cloud of billowing debris.
SMASH TO:

15.

TELEVISION FOOTAGE
Rescue helicopters circle high above the devastated nuclear
power plant -- now the site of a GIANT SINKHOLE IN THE EARTH.
The CONTROL BUILDING still stands at the rim of the giant
pit, but the REACTOR TOWERS HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY SWALLOWED
UP. On a split-screen, a JAPANESE SPOKESMAN speaks to press.
SPOKESMAN (ON TV)
...No evidence to substantiate
rumors of unnatural causes. But
our investigation is looking into
possible human error...
A MAP GRAPHIC indicates a 20 mile “MELTDOWN QUARANTINE ZONE.”
MORE FOOTAGE: UN TROOPS erect ROADBLOCKS and TALL FENCING
around the QUARANTINE BORDER, evacuating CITIZENS from homes;
INJURED VICTIMS are carted out by PARAMEDICS IN HAZMAT GEAR;
the exhausted SAFETY TEAM pushes past a throng of REPORTERS.
Brody is among them, covering his face to avoid the CAMERAS.
INT. HOSPITAL WAITING AREA - DAY
A TV is tuned to the FOOTAGE. JAPANESE FAMILIES have been
here all night, waiting on their loved ones. Ford sits with
Elle, as Brody paces anxiously. Linda is not here.
Brody averts his gaze as the FOOTAGE of him comes up. But
some OTHER VIEWERS here have begun to notice. And stare.
ELLE
Why are they looking at us like
that? Brody?
She is too young to understand. But Ford can read their
glares. These people blame Brody for what happened. Then:
JAPANESE DOCTOR (O.S.)
Mr. Brody?
Heads turn to the inner doorway, where the DOCTOR has emerged
alongside a polished CORPORATION LAWYER in a suit.
BRODY
(snaps to attention)
Yes, is my wife okay?
LAWYER
(puts up a hand and cuts
in, fields this)
My name is Mr. Rye, I’m an attorney
for the company. I’d like to talk
to you about the accident.

16.

BRODY
It wasn’t our fault, you have to
believe me, something strange -LAWYER
Why don’t we have a word in private?
Brody glances back to Ford and Elle. Then follows the Doctor
and Lawyer through the doorway, into an inner hall -As the door seals shut behind them.

Ford steps to the glass.

ELLE
(not tall enough to see)
What is it? Is mommy okay?
ANGLE ON BRODY, THROUGH THE GLASS
Joining THREE OTHER MEN IN SUITS. Among them, stands BAYER,
50. White hair, patrician. We’ll meet him later.
FORD HEARS NO DIALOGUE -- as the Doctor begins by breaking
the news to Brody. Instantly, Brody starts to weep in grief.
ON FORD, staring back through the glass with welling tears.
He knows what this means; his mom is dead.
HIS POV: the Lawyer steps up to Brody, brandishing a LEGAL
FORM. Brody reacts in anger. But the Lawyer TALKS HIM DOWN.
Gesturing back through the glass -- at Ford and Elle. Brody
sees them, and knows what he must do. Relenting.
As the Lawyer offers back the legal form.

Uncaps a pen.

EXT. HOSPITAL STEPS - DAY
Shortly later. A shell-shocked Ford emerges with a tearstreaked Elle, following Brody and the Lawyer onto the steps - where a SWARM OF PRESS AWAITS. FLASHBULBS. Microphones.
Brody tries to shield the children from the onslaught -glancing to the Lawyer, who steps forward.
LAWYER
Mr. Brody has resigned pending a
full inquiry into the cause of
yesterday’s meltdown.
Instantly, the PRESS CRUSHES IN WITH SHOUTED QUESTIONS.
REPORTER 1
Were there design flaws in
the plant?

REPORTER 2
Did your team cause the
meltdown?

17.

LAWYER
(holding them at bay)
We do believe operator error played
a role, but like I said, the
investigation is ongoing. Now if
you’ll please excuse us -TIGHT ON FORD
Hearing this.

He casts a look of shock at Brody.

BRODY
Ford, it’s not how it sounds -But as Brody steps and reaches for Ford and Elle -- the CROWD
PRESSES IN BETWEEN THEM, separating him from them.
Ford does not move.

Just grips Elle close, protectively.
BRODY (O.S.)

Ford --?
As we PUSH IN TIGHT ON FORD in utter anger and betrayal. The
cacophony of shouted questions. The glare of camera flashes.
CUT TO:
EXT. MARINE CORPS TRAINING FACILITY - PRESENT DAY - DAWN
The same face.

Older.

Zen calm.

Focused.

FORD, now 27, is running hard along a gravel path. He has
grown tall, handsome. In the workout gear of a US Marine.
TIGHT SHOTS as he climbs ropes, scales walls, wriggles under
concertina wire. Never pausing for a breath until -He slaps a stopwatch, checks his time.

And now we see:

Ford is all alone on the training course. Not another marine
in sight. He has been racing himself. Running from nothing.
SUPERIMPOSE:

OUTSIDE SAN FRANCISCO - PRESENT DAY

INT. LOCKER AREA - DAWN
Ford towels off after a shower. His body is lean, well
muscled, a perfect marine. And yet -PFC FLACO (PRE-LAP)
Remind me why you work this office
gig again, sir?

18.

INT. MARINE RESERVES OFFICE - SAN FRANCISCO - DAY
PFC FLACO (20s) occupies one half of a desk in a downtown San
Francisco office with windows onto the city. Ford has just
arrived in uniform, and sets his gym bag by his desk.
PFC FLACO
Fit tests like yours, you’d make
Spec Ops in a cinch. Why not see
the world?
Ford sits down and looks at a PHOTO ON HIS DESK: EARLY-20s
ELLE at her COLLEGE GRADUATION. She went instead.
FORD
Lance Corporal, I just did three
tours in two years. Right now it’s
just nice to be home.
Ding.

The door chimes as a PIMPLY NEW RECRUIT walks in.
PIMPLY RECRUIT
Private First Class Murphy, sir,
here to register for duty.
FORD
We’re happy to have you, PFC,
welcome to the Corps.

EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREET - DUSK
Ford parks his ‘75 Camaro at the curb. Kills the engine and
climbs out with a BAG OF GROCERIES. Then stiffens, seeing -Brody, now 50, with many miles on the same kind face. He is
waiting on the stoop of FORD AND ELLE’S VICTORIAN ROW HOUSE.
FORD
(after a beat)
Elle’s not home.
Ford moves past him to the door.

Unlocking it.

BRODY
Actually, I came to see you.
Ford looks back from the door. Clearly less than thrilled by
the prospect. Then walks in. Leaves it open.

19.

INT. FORD AND ELLE’S APARTMENT - DUSK
A warm space, clearly furnished with Elle’s touch. Ford sets
the groceries in the adjoining kitchen, as Brody steps in.
Noticing a few framed FAMILY PHOTOGRAPHS on the credenza.
FORD
Bourbon, is it?
BRODY
Just some water.
Ford reacts to this.

Brody not drinking.

That’s a new one.

Ford begins to fix a cup of water from the faucet. As Brody
lingers in the foyer with the photos. He takes them in.
FRAMED PHOTO: 18-YEAR-OLD FORD, in dress blues at his basic
training graduation, along with a smiling 13-YEAR-OLD ELLE.
All the photos post-date the Hokkaido years. Linda is in
none. Brody regards a recent portrait of Ford in uniform.
BRODY
Double chevron. What’s that, a
sergeant now?
FORD
Corporal.
BRODY
Right, Ellie told me. She’s so
proud. Your mother would be, too.
Ford tenses a bit.

Then sets the water on the counter.

FORD
You want to tell me why you’re
here, Brody?
A beat.

A deep breath.

He approaches the ADJOINING KITCHEN.

BRODY
Right.
(trying to find the words;
he digresses, re: photos)
They evacuated us so fast, you know
I don’t even have a picture of your
mom?
FORD
(not having it)
Look, Brody --

20.

BRODY
I lied.
Just like that. This is what he came to say. The headline,
anyway. It takes a beat to formulate the rest. Struggling.
BRODY
I lied, Ford. They made me sign
something saying it was my fault...
But it wasn’t.
FORD
What are you talking about?
BRODY
It wasn’t normal. There was an
anomaly, a signal. They tried to
tell me it was nothing, but I know
what I saw... And now it’s
happening again.
FORD
What is?
BRODY
It doesn’t matter. Look, I put
some money aside for you guys. In
this account.
He pulls out a BANK LETTER.

Ford - not this again.

FORD
We don’t need your money, Brody.
BRODY
Please, I promised your mother.
Family was everything to her. I
just need you to have it now, in
case I don’t come back.
This throws Ford off-guard.

A first hint of concern.

FORD
Hang on, back from where?
But just then -- Ding-dong-ding-dong!

THE DOORBELL RINGING.

FORD

Wait right here.
He moves to the front door, opening it to find --

friend REGGIE (30s) waits in a RUNNING CAR at the curb. She

FORD

ELLE
Hey, sorry, Reg is waiting in
the car! I just came to
change, we’re meeting some
friends for drinks...

Um --

FORD
Elle, wait!
But Elle makes it into her REAR BEDROOM and shuts the door.
We HEAR the sounds of RUSTLING CLOTHES as she hollers back.
ELLE (O.S.)
I know, I know, keep your phone on
and call if you’re gonna stay out
late... Thanks mom.
She continues on like this, as Ford rushes back to the
kitchen to find -Brody’s bank letter resting on the counter. But Brody is
nowhere to be seen. The back door swings open on its hinges.
FORD
Shit!
ELLE
How do I look?
As Elle at last appears behind him in her dress.

Oblivious.

ELLE (PRE-LAP)
How could you just let him leave?
EXT. TRAILER PARK - NIGHT
Ford follows Elle up the porch of a DILAPIDATED MOBILE HOME.
Newspapers are piled on the steps, perhaps a week’s worth.
ELLE
(pounds the door)
Brody? Brody, it’s Elle!
FORD
I don’t know, it’s crazy, he said
he was going somewhere, then you
came home and he was gone.

Elle tries the door.

It’s locked.

ELLE
BRODY!

Break it down.
FORD
What, are you kidding?
WHAM!

I’m not --

Elle kicks in the door.

But Ford has just seen something else, eyes wide in shock -Uh.

FORD
Elle...?

An entire wall is tacked and pinned with a dizzying mosaic of
DATA SHEETS and PRINTOUTS. Seismic readings. Radio signals.
At the center is A MAP OF THE WORLD MARKED UP WITH PUSH PINS.
Each pin corresponds to a neatly printed number; they lay in
two main clusters: “HOKKAIDO, JAPAN” and “NEVADA, USA.”
Around this are HEADLINES and PHOTOS clipped from tabloids or
printed out from blogs: “HOKKAIDO COVER-UP!” “WHAT IS THE
UN’S SECRET ‘MUTO’ UNIT?” “WHAT ARE THEY BUILDING IN THERE?”
ELLE
He’s going back.
She is holding a PRINTOUT.

ITINERARY for a flight to Japan.

ELLE
Japan Air. Left an hour ago.
(turns to Ford)
We need to stop him.
FORD
Elle, come on...

23.

ELLE
Fine, I’ll go myself.
She moves off, but Ford grabs her wrist.
FORD
He’s not your dad.
ELLE
(spins back)
Neither are you!
This stings.

Ford drops her wrist.

ELLE
He’s the only family I have.
(instantly regrets it)
Ford, you know what I mean. You
aren’t even around half the time,
you’re overseas.
But Ford has turned his back.

Walking out.

ELLE
Ford!
INT. ‘75 CAMARO - NIGHT
As Ford parks the car outside their row house. Kills the
engine. They have driven home in silence. A long moment
passes.
FORD
(calmly as he can)
You know why I was overseas, Elle?
You know why I wasn’t around? For
you. So you could go to school.
Because you’re the only family I
have.
And with that, simply, he gets out.
Elle has a chance to speak.

Shutting the door before

INT. FORD’S ROOM - NIGHT
Ford is up late. Mulling over the PHOTO OF ELLE AT HER
GRADUATION. He has taken it from its frame. But now UNFOLDS
THE EDGE TO REVEAL -- Brody is standing in the picture, too.
His arm around Elle, beaming proudly. Her family, her dad.
Ford sighs.

He knows what he must do.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
Ford moves down the hall, DUFFEL on his shoulder. He pauses
at Elle’s open door, regards her momentarily. Fast asleep.
Then Ford moves on, walking out.

EXT. DESERTED OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT
The SOUND OF GAS MASK BREATHING. Brody treks along the longdeserted rural highway in a HAZMAT RADIATION SUIT. He
carries a CLICKING GEIGER COUNTER and a TELEPHOTO CAMERA.
Abandoned trucks and cars still jam the road, long-since
overgrown by weeds and vines. Frostbitten sunflowers have
sprouted up through DEEP CRACKS in the pavement. Brody
plucks one and seals it in a jar. Tucking away the specimen
for further study. This world has been reclaimed by nature.

INT. BRODY-MADDOX HOUSE - NIGHT
A FLASHLIGHT pans the dark, deserted house. Apart from a
layer of dust and cobwebs, the home appears exactly as we saw
it last. Still stuck in time. Brody warily steps in.
INT. FORD’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Brody’s flashlight illuminates Ford’s room, still in boxes,
except that University of California poster on the door, now
half-peeled and filmed in dust. An old dream, long lost.
INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
Brody’s flashlight settles on a spot on the floor. His
necktie, still right where Linda left it. A FRAMED PHOTO has
fallen on its face beside it. Brody kneels to retrieve it -It is a WEDDING PHOTO of the family. Linda in her gown and
Brody in his tux beside her. Along with a beaming 8-YEAR-OLD
ELLE and a somewhat surly-looking TEENAGE FORD. Brody slides
the photo it from its frame. Regarding it for an extended
beat. Everything he lost. Tears welling in his eyes.
When suddenly, the PICTURE FRAME STARTS RATTLING. Shifting
slowly at first, then skittering fast across the floor -into the base of a METAL LAMP. It clamps there. MAGNETIZED.
All at once, THE LAMP BEGINS TO FLICKER WITH LIGHT.
LINDA’S HAIR DRYER whirs to life. Attracting nearby HAIRPINS
with the same magnetic force. Around the room, every
electrical object in sight has strangely become MAGNETIC.
Brody goes still, unnerved.
EXT. DESERTED SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT
Brody emerges from the house to find the entire street of
homes is affected by the phenomenon. Long decrepit streetlamps flicker. Cars in driveways REV THEIR ENGINES.
TELEVISIONS and RADIOS blurt staticky bits of programming.
Over the horizon where the nuclear plant once stood, the
night sky glows and swirls with GREENISH AURORAL LIGHT.
Captivated for a moment, Brody forgets himself. Then
remembers his Geiger counter: it’s oscilloscope is spiking
wildly. He PULLS OUT A NOTEBOOK, capturing the pattern. As:

26.

Click! The BARREL OF A RIFLE levels at his temple. Aimed at

He’s been like this since we
brought him in. Says he used to
work here, safety engineer...

But Honda stops him. Intrigued by BRODY’S NOTEBOOK. Flips
past the FAMILY PHOTO FROM THE ABANDONED HOUSE to find -- a
schematic map of the world, with DATA POINTS IN UNITS HERTZ.
HONDA
He seems to know the signal. He’s
been recording it. But look here -A second schematic map with similar data points. But this
one is not of Japan. It centered on the desert of Nevada.
HONDA

-- he shows the same pattern coming
from Nevada?
Just then, a KLAXON on the PA sounds.

EXT. MUTO BASE SCAFFOLDING - NIGHT
Scientists hurry about the VAST SCAFFOLDING erected above the
site of the former nuclear plant. Where now we see:
THE HALF-SUNKEN REACTOR UNITS
are ensconced in a GARGANTUAN ORGANIC COCOON of yellowish
uranium glass. The shell is half-translucent, PULSING WITH A
BIOLUMINESCENT LIGHT from deep within that causes all
electrical equipment inside of 20 meters to RATTLE AND SURGE
IN RHYTHM. It is like this thing is breathing electricity.
Among the scientists, some work with tuning forks and sound
equipment; others with oscilloscopes; ENGINEERS attend to a
complex pulley system of HIGH-TENSILE CABLES. All involved
are busily preparing for what seems to be the big event.
INT. CROW’S NEST CONTROL BOOTH - NIGHT
Panoramic windows give onto the bustling activity below.
ANALYSTS attend to monitors showing various INFRARED ANGLES
of what seems to be a TWISTED, EMBRYONIC FORM.
A LABEL marks the monitors:

“HOKKAIDO MUTO (HOK-MUTO)”

ANALYST 1
Gamma rays are plummeting.
It’s drinking it like water.

ANALYST 2
Absorption levels are off the
chart. We need more fuel.

Eyes turn to Bayer, the man we saw only in the background at
the hospital in Hokkaido. Same white hair, same eyes of ice.
BAYER
Add ten kilos of plutonium.
Honda rushes in behind him, carrying Brody’s data sets.
HONDA
Have we picked up any signals
coming from Nevada?
BAYER
(distracted)
Hm? Can’t this wait, Mr. Honda?
DOWN BELOW THEM ON A FOOTBRIDGE,
TECHNICIANS in full biohazard suits load CANISTERS OF
PLUTONIUM GAS into a HYDRAULIC INJECTION PORT drilled into an
excavated section of the cocoon wall. They are “feeding” it.
The cocoon glows brighter as the canisters go in.
HONDA
This is important.
BAYER
(marvels at THE COCOON)
Admire our work, professor. We’ve
doubled its dosage twice in the
last thirty-six hours, but the
temperature is dropping. Do you
know what this could mean?
HONDA
No, Mr. Bayer, none of us knows
anything about the ramifications of
what we’re doing. That’s the
problem.
BAYER
You biologists. Can’t appreciate a
gift from nature.
HONDA
You speak of “nature” like you are
not a part of it.

29.

BAYER

HONDA
This was a prehistoric
species, evolved to
photosynthesize background
radiation. Instead, for ten
years we’ve been feeding it
concentrated doses --

Please.

BAYER
(cuts him off)
And it’s done with them what no lab
could achieve in over sixty years.
Cold fusion, Mr. Honda. That could
power the world, feed millions.
And you’d have us, what, stop now?
Before we even see what it’s
become?
HONDA
We should have destroyed this when
it came here. Instead, you’ve put
it on steroids. And now we might
not have the chance.
BAYER
And if Fleming had sterilized his
Petri dish, he’d never have
discovered penicillin. You worry
too much, Honda.
An indicator BLEEPS behind them.
MUTO ANALYST 1
We’ve got movement on the T-rays,
sir.
Bayer moves off.

Honda is left alone.

He steps out to --

A RAILED BALCONY suspended high above the COCOONED FORM IN
THE PIT. And for a moment awe supplants his dread. Whatever
else this monstrosity may become, it is sublimely beautiful.
INT. UTILITY BUILDING - NIGHT
Brody has been left alone inside his cell. He notices a

As the loud SNAP echoes, the lights go out. Guards quickly
rush outside, forgetting -Brody, still behind the one-way glass. The MAGNETIC DOORLOCK

Brody emerges to find a scene of chaos. He has put back on
his Hazmat suit and the ECHO OF ITS GAS MASK BREATHING

TECHNICIANS AND GUARDS COME FLEEING FROM THE SCAFFOLDING.
A HUGE APPENDAGE SMASHES THROUGH THE NEAREST CATWALKS,
obliterating them in a frightening hail of twisted steel.
Brody is knocked to the ground and trapped beneath the
rubble. Injured, but still conscious, he looks up to see -The Hokmuto, towering high above on six gigantic, articulated
limbs. And as the mutant monster SMASHES THROUGH THE CAMP...

What’s it called?

HONDA
“Jira,” after the Japanese for
“whale.”
ADM STENZ
Fine.
(bungles the
pronunciation)
But these “Zilla” things are all
extinct?
HONDA
Maybe not. There was one, sixty
years ago. First sighted after the
bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
We believe the nuclear radiation
affected him somehow. He became
the bane of your atomic fleet. At
first, you thought it was the
Russians, they thought it was you,
eventually both countries made a
pact to kill it. All those nuclear
tests in the South Pacific? They
weren’t tests.
BAYER
(chimes in; old news)
But that creature was killed at
Bikini Atoll in nineteen fiftyfour. There’s been no sign since.
Honda quickly leaps in, correcting him.
HONDA
There have been “bloops,” deep
ocean hydrophone recordings.
Japansese fishermen reported
sightings. The Oto islanders still
worship him as a god. “Go-jira.”
ADM STENZ
(intercedes)
Worst case scenario. If this...
God-zilla is still out there.
HONDA
The Muto’s sole purpose is to
reproduce. And for that, it needs
a host. If Gojira is alive, it
will call to him. And lure him up.

proceed. The LEADER lifts a hand to signal “halt.”
The SEALs crowd around A LARGE OBJECT ENCRUSTED IN SECRETION.
Flashlights illuminate a STENCILED RADIOACTIVE HAZARD SYMBOL.
As a bright HELICOPTER SEARCHLIGHT SLAMS DOWN FROM OVERHEAD:
A GIANT NUCLEAR-POWERED BALLISTIC MISSILE SUBMARINE, the USS
Alabama, is hanging from the trees above them, as if dropped
in from the sky. It drips with HARDENING SECRETION.
SEAL LEADER
Holy...
FROM THE NAVY CHOPPER CIRCLING ABOVE,
the PILOT and CO-PILOT look on in dumbstruck awe. Their
spotlight has revealed much more than the stranded sub.
THE HOKMUTO
is towering above the jungle canopy. Its body balanced like
a mountain peak on six gigantic legs. Saliva oozes from its
underside, encasing the sub with a glowing, bioluminescent
enzyme. Somehow, this animal is “feeding.”
PILOT
(finishing the sentence)
...shit.
INT. USS HARRY S. TRUMAN - TAC-OPS CENTER - NIGHT
LIVE HELICOPTER FEEDS show the same footage of the Hokmuto.
As Honda casts an accusatory glance at Bayer.
HONDA
You taught it to feed.
BAYER
Admiral, the creature is still
contained outside a population
center. If we end this now, cover
can be preserved. My team can
continue its work with an autopsy.

41.

The Admiral, even after all the talk and briefings, is
unnerved to actually see this monster in the flesh.
ADM STENZ
Let’s go in hot.
EXT. CARRIER BATTLE GROUP - NIGHT
The supercarrier and its battle group of escort ships ROTATE
HUGE ARTILLERY GUNS TO FACE THE RUGGED JUNGLE SHORE.
EXT. USS HARRY S. TRUMAN - FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT
FLIGHT CREW scramble for cover as an F-18 SUPER HORNET
FIGHTER JET screams off the runway with a blast of air.
UP ON THE TOWER WATCH PLATFORM,
Honda steps out for a view, but quickly turns away to shield
his face from BLISTERING EXHAUST. Then he pauses. Seeing -HIS POV: Out to sea, A DARK POINTED OBJECT IS SLICING
THROUGH THE SURF. Approaching us. Honda narrows his eyes.
EXT. WAIKIKI RESORT - BEACHFRONT - NIGHT
A YOUNG FAMILY OF MAINLAND VACATIONERS (FATHER, MOTHER, 6YEAR-OLD SON) stroll the sand, past a hotel Luau pit.
Then a HARSH WIND BUFFETS DOWN as FOUR SH-60 SEAHAWK
HELICOPTERS fly past with a cargo of HEAVILY ARMED MARINES.
FROM THE HELICOPTERS,
MARINE SNIPERS belay down ropes onto the HOTEL ROOFTOPS OF
THE RESORT. Taking up positions, they aim their HIGH-POWERED
SNIPER RIFLES out upon the nearby jungle fringe.
FROM BALCONIES AND ROOFTOP POOLS,
TOURISTS GATHER to point and stare at the strange invasion.
Some snap Facebook photos. All just a curiosity. For now.
INT. MONORAIL TRAIN - NIGHT
Ford and Ichiro occupy a window bench waiting for their stop.
The boy still in blissful ignorance of the worried parents he
left behind. While Ford tries, fumblingly, to distract him.

42.

FORD
What’s your, um -(trying to recall his
Japanese)
Anata no - uh, name, what’s your
name? I’m Ford.
ICHIRO
Goon, goon!
FORD
“Goon?”
But the word means “army.” The boy is POINTING OUT THE
WINDOW, where THE SUPER HORNET FIGHTER ROARS ACROSS THE SKY.
Right past Honolulu Airport, heading for the jungle fringe.
Ford registers surprise.

Training flights at this hour?

INT. F-18 SUPER HORNET COCKPIT - NIGHT
The VIEW OUT THE COCKPIT as the jet crests the MOUNTAIN RIM.
SUPER HORNET PILOT 1
Niner-niner, coming... Jesus.
THE HOKMUTO
comes into view above the trees. Still motionless -- yet as
the jet approaches, a RIPPLE OF STATIC FLITS ACROSS ITS HIDE.
The pilot aims his CROSS-HAIRS at the creature, but they
bounce and waver off, somehow unable to “lock on” target.
SUPER HORNET PILOT 1
Getting a missile guidance error.
Switching over manual.
The pilot FLIPS A SWITCH to aim his cross-hairs manually.
DOWN ON THE JUNGLE FLOOR BELOW,
the Hokmuto shifts slightly on his giant limbs, snapping
trees like twigs underfoot. This causes the Navy SEALs below
to pedal back a ways. Their rifles locked and loaded.
Then the fighter approaches high above.
THE HOKMUTO PIVOTS FAST
as threads of static twitch across its hide like signals,
locating the jet by a kind of ELECTROSENSITIVE PERCEPTION.

43.

And as the jet comes in.
THE HOKMUTO REARS BACK ON ITS FOUR HIND LEGS, RAISING UP ITS
TWO GIGANTIC FORELIMBS. Its entire body GLOWS LUMINESCENT.
As clouds of AURORAL LIGHT begin to swirl the sky above -- as
if it’s charging the air itself.
INT. F-18 SUPER HORNET COCKPIT - NIGHT
The pilot has his aim.

SQUEEZES HIS RED TRIGGER.

SUPER HORNET PILOT 1
Eagle One, away.
AN AIR-TO-GROUND MISSILE
drops from a wing and sparks to life, afterburners blazing
on. But just as it flies off towards the Hokmuto --- THE HOKMUTO SLAMS HIS FORELIMBS DOWN, generating a SHOCKWAVE JUST LIKE THE ONE IN HOKKAIDO that SPLITS THE AIR.
The missile shudders and flames out, spiraling off-course.
ON THE JUNGLE FLOOR BELOW,
the SEAL team dives for cover from the MASSIVE FIREBALL.
EXT. HONOLULU AIRPORT - NIGHT
Simultaneously, LIGHTS GO OUT across the tarmac.
INT. MONORAIL TRAIN - NIGHT
The monorail drifts to a stop as its MOOD LIGHTS FLICKER OUT.
Leaving the entire cabin in pitch darkness. Except for the
ORANGE GLOW OF AN EXPLOSION from the distant jungle hills.
Ichiro has fled, wide-eyed, to the window, pressed up against
the glass. Instinctively, Ford pulls him close.
EXT. WAIKIKI RESORT - BEACHFRONT - NIGHT
Back at the luau. The family of vacationers has heard the
distant explosion. BLACK SMOKE RISES FROM THE JUNGLE CANOPY.
AMERICAN BOY
Mommy, daddy, look!

44.

But the BOY is pointing in the opposite direction, at their
feet. Where SEVERAL FISH FLOP STRANDED ON THE SAND. Looking
back, the entire BEACH IS STREWN WITH COUNTLESS FLOPPING
FISH. The ocean tide is rapidly RETREATING FROM THE SHORE.
Something else is coming.

From the ocean.

EXT. HAWAIIAN JUNGLE - NIGHT
THICK BLACK SMOKE begins to clear, as the SEAL team gets its
bearings, rifles at the ready...
BUT THE ENTIRE JUNGLE HAS BEEN FLATTENED,
in a STRAIGHT PATH over the hillside towards the coast, where
the city of Honolulu lies in wait. The Hokmuto has escaped.
EXT. USS HARRY S. TRUMAN - WATCH PLATFORM - NIGHT
ADM Stenz follows Honda to the platform. Peering out at the
ocean through a PAIR OF BINOCULARS to get a closer view of:
THE DARK POINTED OBJECT MOVING THROUGH THE SURF,
as it rises, joined by TWO SMALLER POINTS ON EITHER SIDE.
They are not three separate objects at all, but the GIGANTIC
MAPLE-LEAF SHAPED DORSAL FIN OF A SINGLE, MASSIVE CREATURE.
And it is swimming directly towards the fleet.
Wonder turns to horror as the FLIGHT CREW braces for impact.
The INBOUND CREATURE DIVES RIGHT UNDER THE CARRIER FLEET.
Then.
GODZILLA!
BURSTS UP from the ocean right beneath them.

As:

INT. ELEGANT BEACHFRONT RESTAURANT - NIGHT
PIANO MUSIC tinkles softly. A COUPLE clinks glasses at a
quiet, mood-lit window seat. They neither hear nor notice -GODZILLA, RISING LIKE A WATERFALL OUTSIDE THEIR SEASIDE
WINDOW. Engulfing THE NAVAL FLEET in a torrent of cascading
surf. His giant jaws unhinge in what can only be a MASSIVE,
ANGRY ROAR TO THE HEAVENS. But we hear none of it. Not yet.
As a TSUNAMI WARNING ALERT begins to blare.

45.

OUTSIDE, A LEASHED DOG
is tied to a seaside bike rack. Barking and lashing out in
terror as the OCEAN BULGES. Then finally its COLLAR SNAPS.
The DOG GALLOPS INLAND. As A MASSIVE TIDAL WAVE CRASHES IN.
EXT. WAIKIKI STREET - NIGHT
TERRIFIED VACATIONERS scramble inland, as the FLOOD-TIDE
CRASHES THROUGH. CHURNING CARS and SNAPPING POWER CABLES,
block-by-block. Leaving all of Waikiki in TOTAL BLACKOUT.
Silence follows.
Tourists huddle in the darkness on their hotel balconies.
Listening to the DEEP BASS GROAN OF GIANT FOOTSTEPS. The
HYPNOTIC, CHURNING RUMBLE OF THE CREATURE’S BREATHING. Then.
GUNFIRE ERUPTS FROM THE HOTEL ROOFTOPS,
as the Marine snipers open fire. TRACER BULLETS SPLIT THE
DARKNESS, sporadically highlighting glimpses of Godzilla’s
giant, passing form: THREE ROWS OF MAPLE-LEAF SHAPED DORSAL
FINS; TWO GIGANTIC THREE-CLAWED HANDS; A LONG, SPINED TAIL.
Gunfire hails in endlessly. But the barrage has no effect at
all. SMOKE CLEARING TO REVEAL: just the very tip of
Godzilla’s giant tail, as it SMASHES through an OFFICE TOWER.
Leaving a TRAIL OF UTTER DESTRUCTION, heading inland.
EXT. HONOLULU AIRPORT - NIGHT
The AUXILIARY POWER KICKS IN, lights returning to the tarmac.
INT. MONORAIL TRAIN - NIGHT
The TRAIN’S SYSTEMS WHIR TO LIFE. Mood lights flicker on.
Momentarily relieved, Ford loosens his grip on Ichiro.
RECORDED VOICE (ON PA)
Please remember to stay clear of
all automatic doors...
OUT THE WINDOW, UP THE TRACK,
SKYWARD LIGHTS COME BACK ON, illuminating the elevated track
ahead. One after the next. All clear. But then:
A SPOTLIGHT HITS THE HOKMUTO
The gigantic parasite is straddling the track ahead.

46.

INSIDE THE MONORAIL CABIN,
passengers SCREAM IN TERROR as the automated train resumes
its journey, gaining speed. Heading for the Hokmuto.
RECORDED VOICE (ON PA)
While standing, please continue to
hold onto the silver handrails...
Passengers scramble desperately for the rear of the train.
Ichiro is swept away from Ford.
FORD
Goon!
HIGH-CALIBER MACHINE GUN FIRE
slices through the air outside. Ford sees it coming right
before it hits and, on instinct, TACKLES ICHIRO TO THE FLOOR.
As BULLETS SHATTER THROUGH THE WINDOWS OF THE TRAIN CAR.
EXT. HONOLULU AIRPORT - NIGHT
An AH-64 APACHE ATTACK HELICOPTER has opened fire on the
creature with a 30-MM CHAIN GUN and a battery of ROCKET PODS.
THE HOKMUTO REACTS
with a swipe of its enormous forelimbs, CRASHING THROUGH THE
ELEVATED TRACK DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THE INBOUND MONORAIL.
The train FLIES RIGHT OFF THE EDGE WITHOUT STOPPING -- then
CATCHES AND HANGS from the shattered section of the track.
INT. MONORAIL TRAIN - HANGING VERTICALLY - NIGHT
DOORS GLIDE OPEN AUTOMATICALLY, causing PASSENGERS TO TUMBLE
OUT. Ichiro slides, screaming towards the OPEN DOORS -RECORDED VOICE (ON PA)
Please watch the gap...
At the last moment, FORD GRABS THE CHILD BY THE WRIST and
yanks him back. Clutching tightly to a silver handrail.
EXT. AIRPORT TARMAC - NIGHT
The Hokmuto senses something. Completely forgetting the
Apache chopper peppering its hide. The Hokmuto turns across
the tarmac. To the darkness. THE SOUND OF GIANT FOOTSTEPS.

47.

The Hokmuto hunkers back, as if unnerved. Then REARS UP ON
ITS HIND LEGS, summoning another charge of bioluminescence.
Auroral lights swirl through the sky above. THEN IT SLAMS
DOWN, unleashing a BLOOD-CURDLING CHALLENGE HOWL AT ITS FOE.
The STATIC SHOCK-WAVE SPLITS THE AIR LIKE LIGHTNING, causing
the Apache chopper to lose power and SPIN OUT OF CONTROL into
A ROW OF JETLINERS PARKED WING-TO-WING ON THE TARMAC.
THE JETS EXPLODE IN A CHAIN OF MASSIVE FIREBALLS.
The billowing fire lights the darkness.

Illuminating:

GODZILLA,
towering above the conflagration, through REFRACTION WAVES OF
HEAT. He stands at 600 FEET, dwarfing the smaller Hokmuto.
AND THEN WITH A DEAFENING BLAST OF AIR, GODZILLA ROARS!
ANGLE TIGHT ON FORD
clutching Ichiro to his chest, as the child SCREAMS -- and
the CREATURES CLASH TOGETHER RIGHT BEHIND THEM.
SMASH CUT TO:
Quiet.

Nothing.

As a hand flips on the light switch.

INT. FORD AND ELLE’S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING
It is before dawn. Elle is just off shift, still in scrubs.
First thing, she powers on the TV, VOLUME MUTED. It is on
commercial. She moves off into the adjoining kitchen,
opening the freezer for a TV-dinner. Then pauses,
remembering -- her phone. She left it at the hospital.
ELLE
Shit.
All the while, what she doesn’t notice is the MUTED TV still
on behind her. No longer on commercial. Now on to BREAKING
NEWS, reporting from Hawaii. It is FOOTAGE OF THE MONSTER
BATTLE THAT WE CUT AWAY FROM. Taken from a distance by what
seem to be amateur handheld cameras, possibly a cell phone.
OBSTRUCTED ANGLES glimpse Godzilla thrashing the Hokmuto to a
pulp. Then towering above the fallen parasite to unleash a
final blow. BLUE FLAMES SPARK FROM GODZILLA’S GAPING MAW...
As Elle obliviously walks past the TV, blocking it from view.

48.

It is the money shot we’ve all been waiting for. But for the
moment, it plays out in silence on a small TV in the corner
of a room three-thousand miles away. As Elle microwaves her
dinner. Rinses up. Changes into an oversized nightshirt.
By the time that Elle returns, the MONSTER BATTLE IS OVER.
TELEPHOTO FOOTAGE shows Godzilla returning to the ocean,
dropping back beneath the waves. Then FOOTAGE CUTS TO THE
ANCHOR AT HIS DESK -- as Elle arrives and changes it without
a look. Settling in to watch some late night monster movie.
Mindless entertainment. She starts to eat her TV dinner.
EXT. DEVASTATED HONOLULU - DAWN
The FALLEN CARCASS OF THE HOKMUTO lays in cinders, amid the
rubble of the Honolulu Airport terminals. FIREMEN douse
flames with water cannons, rescuing SURVIVORS. CITIZENS from
all across the city perch on roofs and balconies to stare.
EXT. MARINE CORPS BASE HAWAII - DAWN
The nearby Marine base has been converted to a makeshift
triage site. RED CROSS MEDICS attend to INJURED SOLDIERS.
As a harried RELIEF WORKER strides fast with a clipboard.
Ford keeps up, holding Ichiro in his arms.
RELIEF WORKER
This way. If his parents survived
the battle, they’ll be waiting.
Ford notices the armband of an injured soldier. The MUTO
Unit emblem. Perhaps it rings a bell. From some of the blog
posts and conspiratorial photos tacked up in Brody’s trailer.
FORD
Excuse me, these soldiers, they’re
not American, who are they?
RELIEF WORKER
(checks clipboard)
Them? UN, or something. They were
on the base before those things
came. Airlifted from Japan, I
think, the earthquake.
This strikes Ford.

Resonates.

Brody must have known.

FORD
You mean Hokkaido? Do you have
names on that list, I had a...

FORD (CONT'D)
...a person I think was back there
when it happened. Nathan Brody?

Ford sets Ichiro down, as the worker scans his clipboard.
RELIEF WORKER
Did you say “Brody?”
The worker confers with a RED CROSS MEDIC. Ford can only
hear the murmurs, see the head shakes. Growing panicked.
What?

FORD
What is it?

ICHIRO’S MOTHER (O.S.)
Ichiro, Ichiro!
Ichiro’s parents have seen him from the crowd. Rushing up
with tears of joy, relief. They snatch him up and carry him
away. As Ichiro waves back to Ford. Who’s now left alone.
RELIEF WORKER
Please come with me, sir.
INT. LARGE MEDICAL TENT - DAY
A VITALS MONITOR beeps above a body on a cot: it is Brody.
Hooked up to IV drips, only semi-conscious. But alive.
RELIEF WORKER
Is this your relative?
FORD
(after a beat, dazed)
Yes. Is he going to be okay?
RELIEF WORKER
Should be, yeah, he’s just sedated.
He was medevaced from Japan a
couple days ago. We tried to
contact next of kin, but then,
well, this happened.
Ford just stands there in a fugue, overcome with relief.
Almost in shock, he reaches out and touches Brody’s hand.

Don’t tell me you haven’t seen it.
He barges past her, rushing in to change the channel.

REGGIE
This.
The TV NEWS. Continuous looping footage of the disaster in
Hawaii. The aftermath. The carnage.
CNN NEWS ANCHOR (ON TV)
...no official statement yet, but
experts recording radiation levels
at the site are wondering if
there’s any connection to
yesterday’s nuclear containment
breach in Hokkaido, Japan...
REGGIE
Hang on, wait’ll you see the
pictures of these things.
But Elle is already reeling from the news, her mind spinning
with impossible connections. Brody? Ford? She remembers
the phone in her hand. Sees the: “VOICE MESSAGE FROM FORD”
Elle quickly presses send.

Phone to her ear now, pacing.

FORD (ON PHONE)
(recorded, GARBLED)
Elle? Listen, reception’s lousy,
I’m in Hawaii, I found... Brody,
I’m... Back to you, I...
THE CONNECTION DIES.

Elle quickly CALLS HIM BACK.

ELLE
Come on, come on, pick up...
There’s an answer.

But instead --

It rings.

ELLE

The horror of her past repeating.

EXT. DECIMATED HONOLULU AIRPORT - DAY
The FALLEN CARCASS OF THE HOKMUTO is being winched to HUGE
CONSTRUCTION CRANES -- as WORKMEN free its limbs from RUBBLE.
One jackhammer slips and smacks a section of the Hokmuto’s
hide, causing an ELECTRIC SPARK TO ARC UP AND BLOW THE FUSE.
WORKMAN 1
(drops the jackhammer)
Ay! What the hell.
SUPERVISOR
Leave it to the demo team.
A GROUP OF DEMOLITION EXPERTS is already busy right nearby,
wiring the rubble with EXPLOSIVES. “FIRE IN THE HOLE!!!”
EXT. PEARL HARBOR PORT - DAY
An enormous CARGO SHIP, Maersk Nord, awaits in port. Its
CAPTAIN is in conversation with ADM Stenz and LT CMDR Hamm.

What was it, God-zilla?
BAYER
Gojira. Yes, Admiral. It matches
all the size data in our records.
During this, Honda sits apart. With BRODY’S NOTEBOOK AND
EFFECTS. He flips past: PHOTOS of Elle in scrubs; Ford in
uniform; the FAMILY PORTRAIT. Finding the SIGNAL DATA:
It is a map showing the “INCIDENCE OF EXTREMELY LONG WAVE
SIGNALS.” One cluster in Hokkaido; the second in Nevada.
Each signal bears a TIME AND DATE. Honda studies these.
ADM STENZ
But I don’t get it, I thought the
Hokmuto would lure it as a host.
Instead, it got its tail whipped.
BAYER
The fossil records in Siberia
suggest this Muto species usually
hunts in pairs. This one was alone
- clearly just out-matched.

53.

ADM STENZ
Thank god for that.
Honda has begun to scribble on a pad. Under the header “MUTO
SIGNALS” he labels two columns: “HOKKAIDO / NEVADA.” And
begins to COPY THE MUTO SIGNALS. Ordering them by date -First one in Hokkaido... Next one in Nevada... Then
Hokkaido... Then Nevada... Hokkaido... Nevada...
Honda flags down Dr. Stabler, showing him the data.
HONDA
It’s a second set of signals.
DR. STABLER
Where’d you get this, that guy at
the plant? He was a quack.
HONDA
No, it’s a pattern, look. The
Hokmuto’s signal from Hokkaido...
Then another from Nevada, the next
day. It goes on like that.
DR. STABLER
(realizing)
Like a call response.
HONDA
(nodding, “yes”)
A conversation. Starting the same
week that the Hokmuto roused from
hibernation.
DR STABLER
You think there’s a mate?
HONDA
(leaps up, urgently)
Mr. Bayer!
But Bayer is busy briefing Stenz across the way.
BAYER
Just a moment, Mr. Honda.
HONDA
I need to know where we disposed of
the second MUTO spore.
BAYER
(distracted)
In the desert. Why?

HONDA
Where in the desert?

It was radioactive, Honda, we put

In the same place we store all our

GAMBLER 1
Jackpot!

Heads turn. But just then, unbelievably, ANOTHER SLOT
MACHINE pays out. And then another. And another... All
down the line. Every machine in the casino is paying out.
Then all at once, the LIGHTS IN THE CASINO DIM AND FLICKER.
A moment later, there is a DISTANT HOWLING ROAR.
EXT. OUTDOOR PEDESTRIAN ARCADE - NIGHT
OUTDOOR MUSIC drowns the roar. SPECTATORS are gathered below
a VAULTED SCRIM, as a DAZZLING LASER LIGHT SHOW plays across
the starry sky. But then: THE LIGHTS AND MUSIC STOP.
The spectators are left in darkness, silence. But just as an
impatient murmur starts -- THE DAZZLING LIGHT SHOW RESUMES.
Filling the entire sky above them. Brilliant colors,
brighter than before, so bright the spectators must squint.
Because it’s not the show at all. It is THE BIOLUMINESCENT
UNDERBELLY OF ANOTHER GIANT MUTO STRADDLING THE STREET ABOVE.
A FEMALE MUTO (”THE FEMUTO”),
even larger than the last.

EXT. SAN FRANCISCO INTERSECTION - DUSK
Elle and Reggie sprint out down the sidewalk, as the four
cars SPIN TO A STOP in a shower of broken glass. The DRIVERS
stagger to their feet, a few cuts and bruises but intact.

DRIVER 2
So did you, the lights went
out!

Indeed, EVERY TRAFFIC LANTERN IN THE AREA IS BLINKING RED.
ELLE

Is everyone okay?
But the drivers are suddenly distracted by something up above
-- A MILITARY HUMVEE SLOWLY PARACHUTING FROM THE SKY.
Thunk! The humvee creaks down at the center of the junction.
Its enormous parachute gently floating in. And now we see:
DOZENS OF SOLDIERS
parachuting into downtown San Francisco. They hit the street
and quickly arm themselves while stunned PEDESTRIANS look on.

ADM STENZ
Well, let’s be glad it doesn’t.
Where’s it going?
Bayer brings up a GEOSPATIAL MAP. Tracking the progress of
the Femuto -- following A ZIG-ZAG PATTERN WEST.
BAYER
This is the new Muto’s course so
far. Now if we bring up nuclear
site locations on the GIS...
RADIATION HAZARD SYMBOLS POP UP ACROSS THE MAP, indicating
each nulcear facility. The Femuto’s course lines up exactly.
ADM STENZ
She’s following the radiation.
HONDA
Except here, this is wrong.
(indicates a RECENT TURN)
If she continued on a straight
path, she’d reach the nuclear plant
at Morro Bay. Instead she turns to
the north. Into the mountains.
Honda traces the path still farther. To a GRAYED OUT SECTION
OF THE MAP DUE EAST OF SAN FRANCISCO. A LABEL READS:
“NORAD - RESTRICTED ZONE”
The military brass trade knowing, troubled looks.
HONDA
What are you keeping here, Admiral?
LT CMDR HAMM
Sir, the contents of that facility
are highly...
ADM STENZ
(cuts him short, doesn’t
care)
We’ve got two hundred and fifty
ballistic missiles in that arsenal.
It’s not exactly public record.
This hangs a beat.
HONDA
Well it is to her.

ADM STENZ
(to Hamm)
Get those missiles out of there and
get techs working to shield the
electronics against these things.
EXT. TWENTYNINE PALMS MARINE BASE - TARMAC - DAY
The C-17 has landed. Marines deplane. As Ford checks his
cell phone for a call from Elle: “NO SERVICE.” Approaching
a SERGEANT (WALTZ) waiting by a CHINOOK TRANSPORT CHOPPER.
SUPERIMPOSE:

TWENTYNINE PALMS MARINE BASE - CALIFORNIA

FORD
Corporal Maddox, sir, I’m looking
for a transpo up to San Fran?
But SGT Waltz is busy on his radio.

Receiving orders.

SGT WALTZ
Yessir. Platoon of reserves just
got here...
(grabs Ford)
You got cammies in that bag,
marine? Get in the chopper.
FORD
Sir, I’m not deployed, just headed
home.
SGT WALTZ
If we don’t do this job, soldier,
you may not have a home to head
back to.
A beat. Ford glances back at the cell phone in his hand -then shoves it back in his pocket and snaps to attention.
FORD
Yes, sir.
AIR RAID SIRENS start to sound, as SGT Waltz moves off to
corral the rest of the platoon. They have a mission.
INT. MGM GRAND HOTEL SUITE - LAS VEGAS - DAWN
A gilded, marble suite. Relaxing MUSIC plays from inlaid
speakers. It is a picture of serenity and peace. Until.
A WHOLE BRIGADE OF FIREMEN steps past us, gazing out in
dumbstruck awe -- AT THE BLOWN OUT WALL OF THE HOTEL SUITE.

61.

As the CHINOOK TRANSPORT CHOPPER whisks past the gaping void.
EXT. LAS VEGAS - HELICOPTER VIEW - DAY
A DEEP CHASM cuts across the entire Vegas Strip, where the
Femuto must have burrowed through beneath the earth. Crowds
of TOURISTS gather far below as RESCUE CREWS attempt to help.
New York-New York has been demolished. Its EMPIRE STATE
BUILDING crunched to sticks, its STATUE OF LIBERTY
disembodied. The facade of faux-America has been laid ruin.
EXT. MAIN STREET - SIERRA MOUNTAIN FOOTHILLS - DAY
The battle has come and gone, CITIZENS evacuated. There is a
LOW DIN OF ARTILLERY SHELLING in the distance. As the
Chinook transport helicopter TOUCHES DOWN.
Ford climbs out IN UNIFORM with a PLATOON OF REINFORCEMENTS.
TROOP CARRIER TRUCKS have just rumbled to a stop. Carrying
HUNDREDS OF BLANK-EYED SOLDIERS just back from the “front.”
The shell-shocked soldiers stagger out in silence. Heading
for the chopper. Ford and the reinforcements are here to
take their place. Some hesitate. But there’s no time to
waste. SGT Waltz hollers above the rotor roar.
SGT WALTZ
Alright, double-time, hop in and
grab some spares!
SGT Waltz holds out a BAG FULL OF ELECTRICAL FUSES. Ford
takes one then hands the bag to ANOTHER MARINE (TRE, 19).
TRE
What are they?
FORD
Fuses.
Ford and Tre move past the dead-eyed veterans, unnerved.
Climbing into the bed of a waiting transport truck.
TRE
(to SGT Waltz)
Hey, how come those guys get the
choppers?

62.

SGT WALTZ
No air cover where you’re goin’.
Big thing sends off some kinda
shock-wave when it howls, fries out
all electric. No biggie in a
truck. Big problems in a chopper.
The SGT gestures out upon A DESERT LANDSCAPE DOTTED WITH
CRASHED MILITARY AIRCRAFT. SMOKE PILLARS billow to the sky.
On Ford and Tre and all the others, as the TRUCK PULLS OFF.
EXT. RAIL DEPOT - DUSK
It is almost nightfall now. As the transport trucks pull up
alongside a COMMERCIAL RAILROAD PLATFORM.
SGT WALTZ
Alright, marines, look alert!
Rifles up! In formation! Go!
The troops pile out into a WORLD OF LOW HANGING SMOKE FROM A
NEARBY FOREST FIRE. The SOUND OF SHELLING IS LOUDER HERE.
The SGT signals caution. As the platoon converges on:
THE PLATFORM
Barely anything is visible around the nearest bend. Ford and
the other troops form a hard line, taking aim into the haze.
There is a GROAN OF RUMBLING FROM THE SHROUDED DISTANCE.
Ford clenches his rifle tightly. Sweat beads forming on his
brow. Not a soul stirs. As the groan becomes a HOWL... AND
A LONG TRAIN WHINES AROUND THE BEND, HEADED INTO STATION.
It is transporting DOZENS OF ENORMOUS ICBM MISSILES.

CUT TO:
The thick of an ungodly traffic jam. A rural highway packed
with the cars and trucks of evacuating citizens. We are --

63.

INT. FAMILY STATION WAGON - DAY
The car is piled with CLOTHING and BELONGINGS. HORNS BLARE
outside as a MOTHER and FATHER bicker in the front seat.
FATHER (O.S.)
I’m trying, I’m trying! No one’s
moved an inch...
Their YOUNG DAUGHTER clutches a TEDDY BEAR in back. The
first to hear the CHIME of RAILROAD WARNING BELLS. Then -The RAILWAY CROSSING GATE ARM lands directly on their
windshield. Their car is on the tracks. As the ICBM FREIGHT
TRAIN rounds a nearby bend -- bearing in.
The Father slams the gas, but his TIRES SPIN IN MUD. As
OTHER PASSENGERS abandon their cars entirely. Ding-ding-dingding! The train is closing in. But just as it does -The tires grab and the car BUCKS FORWARD, clearing the
inbound train by inches as it SCREAMS PAST THE LEVEL CROSSING
-- smashing through the other cars abandoned on the tracks.
ANGLE ON FORD
Standing guard aboard the ICBM arsenal train. As it speeds
past the highway, affording him a brief full view of the
exodus -- a line of vehicles, stretching to the far horizon.
Ford and Tre trade looks as the gravity sets in. The train
drawing past a veil of trees, leaving the exodus behind.
EXT. ARSENAL TRAIN - DUSK
BLACK SMOKE looms above the dense sequoia forest on either
side of the tracks, as the TRAIN WINDS UP A MOUNTAINSIDE.
WEAPONS TECHNICIANS are working on ONE ICBM WARHEAD. They
have an access panel open. They are retro-fitting it.
WEAPONS TECH 1
(shouts to his team)
Alright, this one’s shielded.
Close her up and let’s get to the
next one!
Ford and his platoon stand guard alongside the GIANT ICBM,
reacting nervously to the POUND OF ARTILLERY in the distance.
SGT WALTZ
Don’t look so worried. They’re
modding-up these things to
withstand Armageddon.

64.

To prove his point, the SGT POUNDS HIS RIFLE BUTT against the
giant ICBM FUSELAGE. It clangs harmlessly. Echoing.
Yet Ford and Tre trade looks, uneasy.
EXT. MOUNTAIN PASS - NIGHT
SCREECH! The train jolts as it brakes to a stop outside a
NARROW RAILWAY TUNNEL through the rocky mountainside ahead.
The SOUNDS OF BATTLE are closer now. Dense smoke hangs low.
The SGT leans over to his RADIO OPERATOR.
SGT WALTZ
What’s the status on the track
ahead?
The radio operator tweaks his dials, scanning through WAVES
OF INTERFERENCE. A few crisp VOICES come through:
VOICES (ON RADIO)
(filtered, distorted)
Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!
Then the SOUND OF SCREAMING. Then silence. Even the
shelling in the distance stops. A long beat passes. Then:
STATIC SNAPS THE AIR LIKE LIGHTNING, causing the TRAIN’S
LAMPS TO GO DARK. The radio shorts out, too, leaving us in
silence, darkness. The soldiers tense their bodies.
Ford has been through this before. Instinctively, like a
child in a lightning storm, he starts counting softly:
FORD
One-Mississippi, two-Mississippi,
three-Mississippi...
Tre, a city boy, just watches him, unnerved.
TRE
What’cha doin’, man?
FORD
Summer storms. Mom used to say you
could tell how far away it was by
counting off between the lightning
and the thunder.
TRE
So how far is it?

65.

THE FEMUTO’S CHILLING HOWL
echoes from the distance, RICOCHETING FROM SIDE TO SIDE
ACROSS THE MOUNTAIN PASS. Soldiers stiffen, aiming their
M16s in all directions. Uncertain where it came from.
Tre glances at Ford, jittery. Then STATIC SNAPS THE AIR
AGAIN. This time, Tre joins in counting with him.
TRE
One-Mississippi, twoMississippi, threeMississippi...

FORD
One-Mississippi, twoMississippi, threeMississippi...

THE FEMUTO’S HOWL CUTS THEM OFF AGAIN.

Louder this time.

FORD
It’s close.
Ford regards the flashlight on his rifle. Smoke threads from
its BURNED OUT FUSE. Ford uncaps it, replacing the burned
fuse with his spare. The light comes on. Tre does the same.
SGT WALTZ
(rushes up to them)
Corp. You saw these things before.
Choose a friend and follow me.
INT. DARK RAILWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT
The train waits back outside the tunnel, its ENGINEERS busy
replacing fuses in the engine. As a FIRE-TEAM OF 4 MARINES
stalks cautiously into the pitch-dark tunnel: the SGT and a
RIFLEMAN lead the way; Ford and Tre bring up the rear.
The SGT signals for alert as his men arrive at the opposite
end of the tunnel, stepping out onto:
EXT. TALL TRESTLE BRIDGE - NIGHT
A narrow STEEL-FRAME VIADUCT built high above a riverbed
below. The bridge fades off into a thick haze up ahead, its
other end not visible. Down below, SOUNDS of RUSHING WATER
can be heard, but the river itself is shrouded in the mist.
SGT WALTZ
(to Ford and Tre)
Fire, Assist, you check the tracks.
(to Rifleman)
Ready, come with me.

66.

The SGT and Rifleman hop a side-rail and cautiously descend a
STEEP PATH DOWN THE MOUNTAIN-SIDE TO THE RIVERBED BELOW.
Ford and Tre glance ahead, uncertain.
MOUNTAIN PEAK LOOMS WITHIN THE HAZE.

Behind them, a CRAGGY

TRE
(at Ford, half-kidding)
Some friend.
They step forward slowly through the fog. Wide gaps stretch
from slat to slat beneath their feet, giving onto nothing but
MIST BELOW. A broken slat causes Ford to stumble slightly.
His flashlight clatters off and spins down into darkness.
EXT. UNDER THE BRIDGE - NIGHT
HUGE SEQUOIA TREES stand rooted firmly in the river banks.
As the SGT and his Rifleman move cautiously between them -Ford’s flashlight SMACKS the riverbed, causing the Rifleman
to flinch. The SGT does not react. Noticing something else.
Up river, A BRIGHT LIGHT FLICKERS THROUGH THE MIST. It is
moving, coming towards them. Both men take aim, as the light
looms brighter, closer. Then the LIGHT bursts from the mist:
A FLAMING ABRAMS TANK
FLOATS PAST THEM IN THE RAGING CURRENT, borne away
downstream. The SGT and Riflemen dive aside, looking on in
shock -- as MORE FLAMING MILITARY WRECKAGE drift right by.
EXT. TALL TRESTLE BRIDGE - NIGHT AWAY
Ford and Tre have come to a stop. Hearing the commotion down
below. Ford WHISTLES ONCE then waits a beat. Then a REPLY
WHISTLE comes up from below. Ford nods to Tre. All clear.
They continue on through thickening haze, each step a test of
nerves. Uncertain what may lay ahead. Until at last:
The OPPOSITE MOUNTAIN RIDGE comes into view before them.
bridge is still intact. Ford and Tre exhale relief.

The

All clear, repeat, all clear.
They do not yet turn back to notice through the fog -- as THE
CRAGGY MOUNTAIN PEAK BEHIND THEM SHIFTS IN PLACE AS IF ALIVE.

INT. LOCOMOTIVE ENGINE ROOM - NIGHT
CONTROL PANELS LIGHT BACK UP, as the ENGINEER replaces a
final fuse. Tre’s “All clear” filters in over the radio.
ENGINEER
That’s an all clear. Remember this
thing senses electricity. Build up
some steam then coast the bridge
with the engines off. Lights out.
EXT. ARSENAL TRAIN - NIGHT
The massive Diesel engines churn to life. Marines astride
the ICBM missiles pass the order verbally:
MARINES
Lights out! Lights out!
Flashlights and radios are switched off. The train CHUGS
FORWARD, picking up a head of steam, as it ENTERS THE TUNNEL.
INT. RAILWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT
Then THE ENGINES CUT. The train coasts through the tunnel in
total darkness, just the SPARKS OF WHEELS ON TRACK. Soldiers
tense as the train slowly glides on toward the fog ahead.
EXT. UNDER THE BRIDGE - NIGHT
The SGT and Rifleman look up as the bridge BEGINS TO TREMBLE
with the train’s approach. Then suddenly, the SGT pauses.
Something JUST MOVED inside the nearest stand of trees. The
two men duck for cover behind a huge sequoia. But then THE
ENTIRE TREE UPROOTS ITSELF FROM THE GROUND. Looking up, we
realize it was no tree at all, it was THE FEMUTO’S GIANT LEG.
HOT ZONE!

SGT WALTZ
TAKE COVER!

THE GIANT BEAST ABOVE THEM
trundles through the river toward the trestle bridge.
EXT. TALL TRESTLE BRIDGE - NIGHT
Ford and Tre freeze stock-still, laying on their backs in
perfect silence. As the Femuto dips in right below them.
Her SENSORS GLOW with luminescence as she “SNIFFS” the air.

68.

Sensing their electric currents.
Tre’s FLASHLIGHT FLICKERS. Terrified, he grips his rifle
tighter. Preparing to roll over for a shot -- but Ford
reaches out and stops him with a hand. THEN SHUTS THE LIGHT.
Putting a finger to his lips to signal silence. Stay cool.
After a moment, the Femuto seems to lose their scent. She
backs her head out from under the bridge. Instead, she RISES
TALLER ON HER GIANT LEGS -- and STEPS RIGHT OVER THE BRIDGE
ITSELF. Straddling it. ONE HUGE LUMINESCENT SPORE hangs
just above Ford’s head. Then the Femuto starts to move off.
But the BRIDGE BEGINS TO RATTLE LOUDER. The train is coming
from the tunnel. THE FEMUTO PIVOTS QUICKLY, sensing it.
EXT. ARSENAL TRAIN - NIGHT
Marines clench their M16s as the train emerges from the
tunnel into a peaceful world of mist. They all look forward.
Failing to notice THE GIANT SILHOUETTE GLIDING IN ABOVE THEM.
EXT. TRESTLE BRIDGE - NIGHT
Ford and Tre take off running towards the fog-bank.
FORD
STOP THE TRAIN!

TRE
LOOK OUT!

But A HUGE ROAR drowns their shouts. Followed by the POP AND
FLASH OF GUNFIRE within the fog. All hell has broken loose.
Then suddenly. The RUNAWAY TRAIN COMES CHARGING TOWARDS
THEM, flames pluming from its burning engine as the huge
Femuto ravages the rail cars from above, snatching up the
ICBM MISSILES like so many giant pick-up sticks.
Ford and Tre take off running from the train -- but Tre’s
boot catches in a gap between the slats, just as a GIANT LIMB
SWIPES THROUGH, OBLITERATING THE SECTION WHERE HE STOOD.
With nowhere to go and the train barreling in, FORD LEAPS -OFF THE BRIDGE,
and PLUNGES TO THE CHURNING RIVER DOWN BELOW, as an entire
rail car stacked with ICBMs crashes down behind him. Ford
can only glimpse the carnage before the CURRENT DRAGS HIM
UNDER. The last SOUND he hears is THE FEMUTO’S HELLISH HOWL.

ADM STENZ
What are my options, gentlemen?
We’ve already seen what damage one

BAYER
Our nukes are much stronger these

HONDA
Are you insane? Nuclear weapons
started this. They won’t end it.
ADM STENZ

And I thought these things ate

BAYER
Not if we get in close enough on
land. If we can somehow insert a
hardened warhead on a timer -ADM STENZ
Are you actually suggesting we
detonate a nuke on our own soil?
BAYER
Depending on wind-speed and
direction, and with a fast
evacuation -HONDA
(interrupts)
This is madness. Never mind the
human risk, we’re talking about the
balance of nature. Gojira is an
alpha predator. Without him, there
is no telling what else may come.
ADM STENZ
So you’re suggesting what, we just
sit back and hope he wins?
BAYER
And suppose he does. Then what?
We cheer and wait for him to swim
away? What if he doesn’t?
HONDA
We made this mess by tampering with
Nature. It needs to right itself.
LT CMDR Hamm looks up from the comm.

His face pale.

LT CMDR HAMM
Sir, the train carrying our
shielded arsenal has just gone
missing. We have teams scouring

NATIONAL GUARD SGT
We have orders, ma’am. The city is

The GUARD SGT corrals Elle by the elbow.

She tugs away.

The BODY OF A MAN lays lifeless, half-buried, caked in mud.
And then his eyes blink.
Ford has washed up on the shore. He squints at the
helicopter spotlight up above him. Opening his mouth to

Honda studies Brody’s data sets. Comparing them to his own.

MONITOR FOOTAGE: Godzilla swims on, disappearing into the
EARLY MORNING FOG outside the GOLDEN GATE OF SF BAY.
EXT. GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - DAWN
The bridge is hopelessly snarled with EVACUATING VEHICLES.
DRIVERS blast their horns, jostling futilely for inches.
As a COAST GUARD HELICOPTER hovers in above.
HELICOPTER VOICE (ON PA)
Please leave your vehicles and
clear the bridge, immediately.
National Guards drag drivers from their vehicles. The
civilians struggle, kicking and shouting. Until suddenly.
An AWFUL SCREECHING ECHOES FROM THE FOG-BANK OUT TO SEA.
Then A GIANT FLOCK OF SEAGULLS FLIES SCREECHING FROM THE FOG,
SMACKING INTO WINDSHIELDS. But they just keep flying.
Desperate to escape. And then we HEAR the reason why.
THE RUMBLING THUNDER OF FOOTSTEPS UNDERWATER.

BOOM!

BOOM!!!

AIR-GROUND MISSILES scream past overhead, vanishing within
the fog-bank. Then after a beat. THE MISSILES EXPLODE IN A
FIREBALL within the fog-bank that briefly silhouettes:
GODZILLA, AS HE ROARS,
escorted by the swarm of A-10 WARTHOGS, already peppering his
hide with BARRAGES OF ARTILLERY. But the onslaught barely
slows his stride, as Godzilla surfaces in the direction of -THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE ITSELF
DRIVERS stare captivated for a beat too long, because: the
Bay is not deep enough to accommodate the standing giant. As
Godzilla rises higher above the water, chest, arms, torso.
Terrified drivers desert their cars, STAMPEDING left and
right until -- GODZILLA TEARS THROUGH THE BRIDGE MID-SPAN.
Thousands of abandoned cars spill into the Bay, along with
giant segments of the roadway. Then the MASSIVE CABLES
supporting the rest of the bridge-span snap in turn, PULLING
DOWN THE HUGE STEEL TOWERS in a catastrophic domino effect.
EXT. SAN FRANCISCO BAY - DAWN
As Godzilla wades on, unimpeded, into San Francisco Bay.

77.

The Bay is shrouded in a DRIZZLING MORNING FOG. Little
visibility within it. Godzilla hesitates a moment, trailing
a mess of concrete and twisted steel. He senses something.
Then.
A HUGE SHELL sails up, whistling, from the foggy Bay. BAM!
The shell impacts Godzilla with a powerful concussion. And
now we see, emerging from the fog-bank all around him:
THE ENTIRE BAY IS RINGED WITH US NAVY WAR SHIPS. They open
fire all at once. Sending up a SALVO OF POWERFUL ARTILLERY.
Godzilla HOWLS IN ANGER as small explosions pock his chest.
His progress halted, Godzilla pivots for an angle of escape --- but TWO GUIDED MISSILE CRUISERS now block the path behind
him. A FULL VOLLEY OF TOMAHAWK MISSILES EXPLODE from the
topside launch tubes, arcing up and racing towards him.
Godzilla has just enough time to ROAR. Before the missiles
connect and EXPLODE IN AN ENORMOUS CONFLAGRATION. And then
ANOTHER HELLISH ROAR. As Godzilla emerges from the inferno,
battle-scarred and angry, but very much alive.
With nowhere else to go, Godzilla lumbers onto the fog-bound
shore of ALCATRAZ. Trapped. As gunfire keeps raining in.
EXT. SAN FRANCISCO GENERAL HOSPITAL - DAY
A SERIES OF MEDEVAC CHOPPERS are taking off -- as AMBULANCES

Looking out upon the foggy Bay -- Godzilla’s silhouette,
enshrouded in the smoke and mist. As HE ROARS MIGHTILY.
BRODY
Are you sure I’m still conscious?
ELLE
(utter disbelief)
I’m not sure I am.
She wheels him into the ambulance and Reggie shuts the doors.
INT. CHINOOK TRANSPORT HELICOPTER - FLYING - DAY
The ICBM MISSILE has been strapped down inside the transport
cabin. Ford sits beside it, caked in mud. Staring at --

78.

THE FRESH-FACED SOLDIERS here to guard it. We recognize -the same PIMPLY RECRUIT we met at Ford’s reserve office. No
more than a week in uniform. Both men stare in silence.
No words could possibly suffice.

This is what it’s come to.

EXT. USS HARRY S. TRUMAN - FLIGHT DECK - DAY
As Ford’s transport chopper spins down on the flight deck.
EXPERTS SWARM THE ICBM, preparing it for quick deployment.
Ford is left alone, ignored. The city of San Francisco looms
through the fog on the horizon. Distant sounds of SHELLING.
SUPERIMPOSE:

USS HARRY S. TRUMAN - OUTSIDE SAN FRANCISCO

SEVERAL MEDEVAC CHOPPERS have just landed nearby. PARAMEDICS
unloading EVACUATED CIVILIAN HOSPITAL PATIENTS on stretchers.
FORD
Are all these people from the city
hospitals?
PARAMEDIC 1
Critical only, other patients went
out in buses, and everyone else is
in the subway tunnels. Things were
built to withstand Russian nukes,
so let’s just hope they can survive
our own.
This resonates on Ford.

He hadn’t realized.

FORD
We’re using a nuke in San
Francisco?
PARAMEDIC 1
I’m just a paramedic, man, you’re
the soldier. But I do have eyes.
He nods across the deck, where A TEAM OF WEAPONS TECHS has
boarded the transport with the ICBM. Already lifting off.
As Ford looks on in rising dread.
EXT. SAN FRANCISCO BAY - DAY
The recovered ICBM is lowered in by winches from the Chinook
Chopper onto the deck of an AMPHIBIOUS TRANSPORT VESSEL.

79.

WEAPONS TECH 2
Easy, easy!
Hundreds of SAILORS and MARINES look on from other warships.
As artillery continues to hail down on Godzilla in the Bay.
LT CMDR HAMM (PRE-LAP)
The nuke is on a hardened timer.
INT. USS HARRY S. TRUMAN - TAC-OPS CENTER - DAY
Adm Stenz paces in anticipation.
LT CMDR HAMM
Once set, our fleet will have fortyfive minutes to make its way out of
the Bay. And with a hypocenter on
Alcatraz Island, the civilians in
the tunnels should be spared.
A beat.

Turns back, solemnly.
ADM STENZ
You realize what we’re doing here.
LT CMDR HAMM
I’m trying not to, sir.

EXT. SAN FRANCISCO BAY - DAY
The ICBM transport converges in towards Alcatraz, surrounded
by DOZENS OF TROOP CARRIER LANDING CRAFT. Up ahead from this
POV, Godzilla is mostly shrouded from view by FOG AND SMOKE.
ABOARD THE ICBM TRANSPORT,
weapons techs busy about the MISSILE on the deck. Its CONE
TIP has been opened on a massive hinge -- giving access to
the TRUNK-SIZED WARHEAD WITHIN. The techs dictate redundant
protocols as they tweak DIALS, ENTERING THE LAUNCH CODE:

INT. USS HARRY S. TRUMAN - STATEROOM - DAY
Honda is still poring over data sheets and CLOSE-UP PHOTOS of
the Hokmuto’s corpse. Using a felt-tipped pen to CIRCLE FOUR
STRANGE FEATURES ON ITS HIND LEGS.

80.

He compares this to AN IMAGE OF THE ADULT MUTO CARCASSES FROM
SIBERIA -- THE ONE WITH FOUR WINGS IN PLACE OF ITS HIND LEGS.
His eyes widen.
INT. USS HARRY S. TRUMAN - TAC-OPS CENTER - DAY
As Bayer and the other brass follow the events in the Bay on
VARIOUS MONITORS WITH LIVE FEEDS. Honda bursts in, abruptly:
HONDA
We need to reach the ship that was
transporting the Hokmuto...
Heads turn.

Honda brandishes his photos of the Hokmuto.

HONDA
The outer shell began to shed too
quickly. This is far more radical
than normal decomposition, it must
be a chrysalis.
BAYER
What makes you think --?

ADM STENZ
A chrysalis?

HONDA
Like a pupal stage in larval
insects. The “carcass” in Hawaii
was a stage of metamorphosis. A
cocoon.
ADM STENZ
So you’re saying the male MUTO is
still alive?
Yes.

HONDA
And now it’s fully grown.

LT CMDR Hamm looks up from an analyst station.
LT CMDR HAMM
The Hokmuto’s freighter just turned
up in Barrow, Alaska...without him.
ON MONITORS: The giant cargo ship, Maersk Nord, has run
aground on a ROCKY ALASKAN BEACH. ONLOOKERS crowd around -but the Hokmuto’s “carcass” is nothing but an EMPTY SHELL.
ADM STENZ
Get me the ICBM transport, now.

81.

EXT. ICBM TRANSPORT VESSEL - DAY
The ICBM transport glides up onto Alcatraz island’s shoals.
Accompanied on both sides by landing crafts of ARMED MARINES.
The weapons techs are almost finished with their task.
WEAPONS TECH 2
Prepare to engage.

WEAPONS TECH 3
Prepare to engage.

They stop. Their eyes meet. No turning back from here...
Then they TURN THEIR KEYS IN UNISON. A DIGITAL TIMER STARTS:
45:00:00...

44:59:00...

44:58:00...

WEAPONS TECH 2
Alright, get this cone locked on,
and take this eagle in, we have Tminus forty-five to clear the Bay!
The techs quickly refasten the missile cone. Locking the
warhead deep within its giant rocket casing. None noticing -the INTER-SHIP COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM, which sputters static.
EXT. ALCATRAZ ISLAND - DAY
FLASHLIGHTS flicker, too, as Marines trek deeper inland from
their landing craft. The shelling has stopped. Godzilla has
gone silent. His HUGE FORM COMPLETELY SHROUDED IN THE HAZE,
from the perspective of those on the ground looking up.
MARSOC LEADER
We’ve lost visual, stay tight.
As they proceed, a DARK FORM TAKES SHAPE INLAND, THROUGH THE
FOG. The marines clutch their rifles, taking aim. Then the
dark shape resolves into dozens of smaller shapes:
It is ANOTHER MARINE PLATOON converging from the opposite
side of the island. Confused, they lower their weapons. As
dense mist parts TO REVEAL THE RUBBLE OF THE FORMER PRISON.
But no Godzilla... The creature has escaped back to the Bay.
MARSOC LEADER
(stops short)
What the...
Suddenly. There is a SNAP OF STATIC THROUGH THE AIR.
RIFLE BARREL-LIGHTS GO OUT. And a moment later --

Their

EXT. OAKLAND BAY BRIDGE - DAY
Both levels and all ten lanes have been closed to outside
traffic. ARMORED HUMVEES escort a LONG MOTORCADE OF
EVACUATION AMBULANCES. Crawling East like ants across a log.
Then all at once, their ENGINES JOLT TO A STOP on the bridge.
INT. ELLE AND BRODY’S AMBULANCE - DAY
The ENGINE DIES AND DOME LIGHTS BLINK OUT. The ambulance has
stalled in the middle of the bridge. For a moment, there is
silence. Raindrops pattering the rear bay windows.
BRODY
Look!
The entire ELECTRIFIED SKYLINE OF SAN FRANCISCO BLACKS OUT.
And just then, finally -- A MUTO’S DISTANT HOWL ECHOES IN.
INT. USS HARRY S. TRUMAN - TAC-OPS CENTER - DAY
THE VIDEO FEEDS from San Francisco SPUTTER OUT.
LT CMDR HAMM
(into COMM)
Flag ship, come in, come in!
Interference whines on every channel.

They lost the fleet.

HONDA
It’s the Muto.
Already?

ADM STENZ
I thought we had more

BAYER
(re: GIS MAP, confused)
We should. Our seismic stations
are reporting activity on the
Calaveras fault line, East of
Oakland. The female isn’t here
yet.
ADM STENZ
Well something is.
LT CMDR Hamm gets word nearby.

83.

LT CMDR HAMM
We’re picking up a radar anomaly by
Bolinas Bay.
ADM STENZ
Tell our subs to form a hard line.
HONDA
(but that’s the thing)
It won’t be in the water.
EXT. OAKLAND BAY BRIDGE - DAY
All along the bridge, PARAMEDICS are out on foot, replacing
BLOWN OUT FUSES. Reggie works the engine on their rig.
REGGIE
(calling back to Elle)
Alright, hit it!
INT. ELLE AND BRODY’S AMBULANCE - DAY
But Elle is studying the pedals in consternation.

The

ELLE
Which one’s the clutch again?
BRODY
(from behind her)
Left pedal.

REGGIE
(from outside)
On the left!

Ambulance by ambulance, the convoy is coming back to life
behind them -- while theirs remains stalled in its lane.
Elle finds the left-most pedal.
ELLE
Okay, try again!
Just then: Whoosh! A SQUADRON OF F-18 SUPER HORNET JETS
COMES SCREAMING PAST THE BRIDGE ABOVE. Heads turn in awe.
EXT. CLOUDY SKIES ABOVE THE BAY - DAY
The squadron flies in tight formation through DENSE CLOUDS.
SUPER HORNET PILOT 2 (ON RADIO)
CAG, my nose is cold. Repeat, lost
radar.

84.

INT. F-22 RAPTOR COCKPIT - DAY
As a SHADOW FALLS ACROSS THE SKY ABOVE THEM -SQUAD LEADER (ON RADIO)
Um, I don’t think you’ll need it.
THE GARGANTUAN UNDERSIDE OF AN ENORMOUS FLYING CREATURE: THE
HOKMUTO, FLYING THROUGH THE AIR ON FOUR GIGANTIC WINGS, where
once its hind legs were attached. It is the ADULT MALE MUTO.
As the jets rise up from below like mid-air escorts -- THE
HOKMUTO’S BODY STARTS TO CHARGE WITH A BIOLUMINESCENT GLOW.
The sky around it swirling with a green auroral light.
SQUAD LEADER (ON RADIO)
Right wing, prepare to engage.
But just then -- THE CONTROLS IN THE COCKPIT FLICKER.
INT. ELLE AND BRODY’S AMBULANCE - DAY
VROOM!

Elle’s ignition catches and the engine roars to life.
BRODY
That’s it, you got it!

OUTSIDE ON THE BRIDGE AHEAD,
Reggie gives a thumbs up and shuts the hood. Winding up his
jumper cables to return them to ANOTHER AMBULANCE ahead.
REGGIE
Just a second, keep it running!
But Brody sits up in his cot.

Seeing something --

BRODY
Elle?
JUST OUT THE WINDOW: A FIGHTER PILOT FLOATS DOWN IN AN
EJECTION SEAT. Parachuting slowly, a captivating sight.
Elle turns to look. But before there’s time to process:
THE HOKMUTO FLIES OUT FROM THE CLOUDS ACROSS THE BAY.
ELLE
Oh my...
ANGLE ON REGGIE
Drops his jumper cords.

Agape.

And just then --

85.

REGGIE
...god.
A FIGHTER JET SLAMS DOWN INTO THE BRIDGE BESIDE HIM,
obliterating Reggie and the other ambulances where he stood.
INT. ELLE AND BRODY’S AMBULANCE - DAY
Elle screams as the fireball plumes toward her windshield.
ELLE
REG!
THE ENTIRE FIGHTER SQUADRON IS RAINING FROM THE SKIES.
EXT. ALCATRAZ ISLAND - DAY
Marines dive aside as the JETS MEET GROUND, shelling the
island in a bone-rattling succession of FIREBALLS.
EXT. ICBM TRANSPORT VESSEL - DAY
A jet hits the FLIGHT TOWER, launching a spray of flaming
wreckage onto the fuselage of the ICBM on the deck.
Weapons techs scramble to protect the FRAGILE MISSILE CONE.
But just then a SHADOW LOOMS ACROSS THEM FROM ABOVE. They
look up just in time to see:
THE HOKMUTO PLUMMETING DOWNWARD with its jaws agape, like a
dive-bombing predator. He PLUNGES right down through the
vessel -- VANISHING WITH IT UNDERNEATH THE WATERS OF THE BAY.
A long beat passes.

The Bay is left in silence.

Then the Hokmuto EXPLODES UP FROM THE BAY like a bird with
its prey, CLENCHING THE GIANT ICBM MISSILE IN ITS JAWS. And
emits a PIERCING, HOWLING CALL. It soars back into the sky.
INT. ELLE AND BRODY’S AMBULANCE - DAY
The ENGINE GRINDS as Elle struggles to get it into gear. She
is still in shock, tears streaming. Just trying to focus.
The vehicles behind her HONK and jostle in a panic -- but her
ambulance just revs its engine, stuck in its lane. Up ahead,
the wrecked jet burns across the lane divide not twenty yards
ahead. Flames lick the INTACT MISSILES ON ITS BROKEN WING.

86.

ELLE
Come on, come on, dammit Ford!
(the gears connect)
GO!
But the rig lurches BACKWARD. She has put it in reverse.
Elle quickly slams the brakes. But now the traffic behind
her has just enough space to squeeze right past, RAMMING HER
AMBULANCE ASIDE AS THEY SWERVE AROUND ONTO THE BRIDGE AHEAD.
Wait!

ELLE
Help!

But just then, the INTACT MISSILES ON THE FIGHTER JET IGNITE.
BOOM! The explosion swallows up the fleeing vehicles ahead -causing a HUGE SECTION OF THE BRIDGE TO PANCAKE BACKWARDS.
Elle is already in reverse. She floors it, chased by the
collapsing roadway, back towards San Francisco.
CUT TO:
EXT. DOWNTOWN SAN FRANCISCO - DAY
A deserted downtown intersection. A shadow falls from above.
Then the ICBM MISSILE crashes down onto the junction. It has
been placed there by the Hokmuto, who has alighted. And now
unleashes a DEAFENING, BLOOD-CURDLING HOWL TO THE SKIES.
He is calling to his mate. This missile is her dowry.
long beat of silence passes. Then the GROUND RUMBLES.

A

INT. BART SUBWAY PLATFORM - BELOW THE CITY - DAY
As the Hokmuto’s howl echoes through the darkened tunnel.
FLARES illuminate HUDDLED MASSES OF EVACUATED CITIZENS.
All eyes pan upward in suspense. DUST FLUTTERS from the
ceiling. The Hokmuto is right above them. So it comes as a
surprise -- when the ENTIRE PLATFORM BUCKLES UNDERNEATH THEM.
Something else is rising from below.
EXT. CHINATOWN STREET - DAY
A parachute dangles from a lamppost. As a DOWNED PILOT
unbuckles his ejection seat, dropping to the sidewalk.
The deserted street has been decked out with ASIAN LANTERNS
and ELABORATE PAPER DRAGONS for some interrupted festival.

87.

But there is no one left. The city is completely quiet.
Then: A POLICE CAR ROLLS PAST THE NEAREST INTERSECTION.
DOWNED PILOT
(sees it, shouts)
Hey! Over here!
He takes off chasing it around the corner -EXT. COLUMBUS-BROADWAY INTERSECTION - DAY
But the police car swerves out of control and jumps a
sidewalk, crashing to a pole. The pilot races up, confused -BUT THE POLICE CAR IS COMPLETELY EMPTY. It slid here.
And now the pilot glances up the street to see MORE ABANDONED
VEHICLES sliding towards him, some fishtailing, skidding
sideways as the STREET ITSELF BULGES LIKE A WAVE.
Spooked by this, the pilot backs away.

Sees:

THE WAVE IS TRAVELING TOWARDS THE GIANT ICBM MISSILE,
HUGE CRACKS SPIDERWEB THE ASPHALT underneath it as the wave
arrives. And the entire intersection DIPS DOWN LIKE A BOWL.
Then starts to fracture. Swallowing the ICBM FROM BELOW.
FROM HIGH ABOVE THE INTERSECTION,
The Hokmuto is perched between TWO HIGH-RISE OFFICE TOWERS,
his wings wrapped around them like a pair of flimsy stilts.
HUGE CHUNKS OF CONCRETE dislodge, crashing to the street
below. And as THE HOKMUTO UNLEASHES ANOTHER HOWLING CALL.
THE DOWNED PILOT CLAMBERS TO FLEE,
but the GROUND GIVES WAY BENEATH HIM, swallowing the entire
ICBM in A GIANT SINKHOLE. Dust and debris blast upward -And then THE FEMUTO RAISES HER ENORMOUS BODY FROM THE VOID,
with the ICBM in her MASSIVE JAWS. She HOWLS UP AT HER MATE!
EXT. USS HARRY S. TRUMAN - FLIGHT DECK - DAY
Medics assist a MASS OF NEWLY ARRIVED HOSPITAL EVACUEES, as
Ford presses through, searching desperately for Elle.
FORD
Excuse me, excuse me?
The ER Doctor is too busy to look up.

Tending to a patient.

88.

FORD
Are you from San Francisco General?
I’m looking for my sister, she’s a
nursing student there, Elle Maddox?
ER DOCTOR
Yeah, yeah, she wasn’t on a
medevac. She and Reggie took her
dad out on a bus.
FORD
Her dad, Brody?

Did they get out?

ER DOCTOR
I don’t know, my guess is, if she
made it off the bridge, she’s still
trapped in the city.
On Ford, the utter horror of this sinking in. And just then - AIR RAID SIRENS BLARE. SOLDIERS sprint across the deck.
LOUDSPEAKERS
All soldiers, please report to the
hangar bay. Repeat...
INT. USS HARRY S. TRUMAN - HANGAR BAY - DAY
The soaring hangar bay is crammed with TROOPS OF EVERY BRANCH
AND STRIPE. ADM Stenz is mid-way through his briefing. Next
to him, Honda projects images of the GIANT OVAL MUTO SPORES.
ADM STENZ
(gravely, shaken)
As some of you may know, a plan to
detonate a warhead in San Francisco
Bay has gone SNAFU. The missile’s
now located in Downtown San
Francisco. And we need a weapons
crew down on the ground, stat, to
pull the plug. That crew needs
backup...
As Ford jostles in along with several others AT THE REAR...
MURMURS AND REACTIONS periodically ripple through the crowd.
A PROJECTED SATELLITE FEED shows THE RUBBLE OF CHINATOWN,
where A SUPERIMPOSED CIRCLE DENOTES the ICBM’s location.
FORD
(whispering)
What’s happening?

89.

ARMY SOLDIER
Flying thing dragged the nuke to
shore. It goes off, so does the
whole city.
NAVY SEAMAN
They’re HALO jumping in a bunch of
techs to disarm it. They need
boots for cover.
Ford pushes closer to the front.
ADM STENZ
...Truth is, for most of you, this
could be a one-way ticket. Some of
you have families. Not a soul here
will look askance if any of you men
decide to walk away right now. But
make no mistake.
(a beat)
Your courage has never been more
needed than it is today.
A long beat.

Not a soul in the hangar moves an inch.

FORD
(for Elle and Brody)
Where do I sign up, sir?
Then, following Ford, OTHER TROOPS step forward, too...
Up ahead, Honda observes Ford with a look of recognition.
EXT. USS HARRY S. TRUMAN - FLIGHT DECK - DAY
A V-22 OSPREY TILT-ROTOR is being readied for its take-off.
NAVY CHIEFS collect A SINGLE DOG TAG from each VOLUNTEER.
Just in case. As Ford deposits his in the GROWING PILE.
HONDA (O.S.)
Mr. Brody?
Ford turns.

Honda hustles up across the deck.

Holding out --

HONDA
Is he your father?
The PHOTOS from Brody’s things: one of Ford in uniform; the
other from Hokkaido, of the entire family as it once was.
FORD
(sees it, stunned)
Where’d you get this?

90.

HONDA
He had it in Japan. I believe he
came to warn us.
(then)
I am sorry we did not listen.
As the Navy Chief corrals the final troops into the Osprey.
NAVY CHIEF
Hurry up, let’s go!
FORD
(takes the PHOTO)
Thank you.
Honda nods. Deep wells of regret, compassion. Looking on,
as Ford boards the plane. Honda calls back to him.
HONDA
Soldier.
(Ford turns)
Your father would be proud of you.
Ford nods back from the plane.

As its rear hatch slams shut.

EXT. EMBARCADERO - SAN FRANCISCO - DAY
They’ve left the ambulance behind. Elle is hurrying a weakkneed Brody up the ramp to the ENTRANCE OF THE BART STATION -BRODY
Elle, I’m sorry about your friend -But she’s on a mission.

Moving fast to keep the pain at bay.

ELLE
(cuts him off)
We have to keep going.
They reach THE DOORS -- TO FIND THEM BARRICADED SHUT.
ELLE
(tries it, hopelessly)
No! No!
BRODY
We can head inland. Some of the
old buildings may have shelters.
Just then -- SOMETHING GROWLS AT THEM FROM BEHIND. Elle and
Brody turn back to see A WHOLE PACK OF RUNAWAY DOMESTIC DOGS.
All of them growling in the direction of the Bay...

91.

But before the fear can even set, something much worse rises
up behind them, soaring high above the TRANSAMERICA TOWER -THE WINGED HOKMUTO
CALLS OUT TO THE BAY WITH AN EAR-SPLITTING CHALLENGE HOWL.
Causing the pack of dogs to skitter off in terror.
BRODY
Uh oh.
Then a BASS ROAR RUMBLES BACK FROM DEEP WITHIN THE WATER. As
the BAY ITSELF BEGINS TO BULGE. Elle grabs Brody by the arm.
ELLE
Let’s go, let’s go!
And A LIVING WATERFALL EXPLODES UP behind them as:
GODZILLA RISES FROM THE BAY,
responding to the Hokmuto’s challenge with a DEAFENING,
UNHOLY ROAR. Godzilla has come to make his final stand.
ELLE AND BRODY
race full-tilt across the Embarcadero -- as the concussive
impact of GODZILLA’S FOOTFALLS SENDS BRODY STUMBLING
HEADLONG. Elle stops to help him to his feet.
BRODY
Go without me!
But now she looks him in his eyes.

Tears in her own.

ELLE
Not a goddamn chance!
HIGH ABOVE THEM, THE HOKMUTO
is swooping in to meet Godzilla. Godzilla quickens his pace,
almost RUNNING TO ENGAGE THE FLYING PARASITE. And just as
Elle and Brody are caught between the two -INT. TRANSAMERICA TOWER LOBBY - DAY
-- they dive through the doors of the TRANSAMERICA TOWER.
the CREATURES CLASH TOGETHER RIGHT OUTSIDE BEHIND THEM.

As

HARD CUT TO:
THE FAMILY PHOTO Brody rescued from Hokkaido. Tattered, but
still somehow intact. Ford holds it in his fist.

92.

INT. V-22 OSPREY JUMP PLANE - DAY
Then he tucks it in the Velcro pocket of his JUMP SUIT. The
plane is FILLED WITH SOLDIERS IN HALO JUMP GEAR. All of them
performing similarly sentimental rituals. Only the DRONE OF
ENGINES CAN BE HEARD as a PRIEST shouts prayers from a Bible.
But a JUMP SGT is repeating orders, drowning out the prayer:
PRIEST
And he will send his angels
with great trumpets!

JUMP SGT
One more time! No chute
release until below one
thousand feet! Locate the
ICBM! Cover the techs while
they deactivate the warhead!

A DEAFENING BLAST OF AIR cuts this short, as the REAR BAY
DOORS glide open. It is shockingly loud. JUMP MASTERS guide
the HALO JUMPERS, one-by-one out into the great beyond.
Ford reaches his turn and just begins to INTAKE A BREATH -when the JUMP SGT SHOVES HIM OUT THE BAY BEFORE HE CAN.
EXT. 25,000 FEET ABOVE THE CITY - DAY
Instantly, the world goes quiet. Just the peaceful whistle
of thin air above the clouds. Hundreds of SOLDIERS FREE-FALL
FROM THE SKY. As Ford sails down past DENSE CLOUD COVER -THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO
draws into view below. From Ford’s POV, the damage wrought
is mind-boggling. Fires blaze through plumes of smoke.
A HUGE WAKE OF DESTRUCTION cuts across the Embarcadero and up
Telegraph Hill -- where THE FEMUTO SITS IN HER “NEST.” As
GODZILLA AND THE HOKMUTO BATTLE amidst the city’s high-rises.
It is a fair fight, but not an even one. Godzilla is far
stronger. Pestered by the flying parasite, yet hardly fazed.
As the Hokmuto dive-bombs for Godzilla -- Godzilla lashes out
with an agile tail-whirl, smacking his opponent from the sky.
THE HOKMUTO TUMBLES DOWN BROADWAY IN A SWATH OF DEVASTATION.
MEANWHILE, PARACHUTING IN ABOVE THEM,
Dozens of soldiers have pulled their chutes too soon and are
drifting down right on top of the fighting monsters. Some
are smacked aside or sliced in half by flailing talons.
As Ford looks on in horror, still 10,000 feet above the city.

93.

EXT. USS HARRY S. TRUMAN - VULTURE’S ROW - DAY
ADM Stenz has stepped out to find Honda standing at the rail - gazing out upon the SMOKE-FILLED SKIES OF SAN FRANCISCO.
The MONSTER BATTLE IS ONLY VAGUELY VISIBLE THROUGH HAZE.
Honda holds his OLD BRASS POCKET WATCH. A rail conductor’s
time piece, its glass face cracked. His fingers work it
automatically. Winding and winding it in endless turns. But
THE HANDS HAVE LONG SINCE STOPPED. They tell a time: “8:15”
HONDA
It was my father’s.
ADM STENZ
(sees it, knows the time)
Eight fifteen in the morning.
was the time of the Hiroshima
blast.
Honda continues gazing out.

That

Remembering.

HONDA
It was noon when he came to. Lying
on his back under the summer sun.
Bodies everywhere he looked,
scattered across what used to be
the school yard. Blue fires were
flying in the air... Phosphorus
from all the burning bones. He
said it was the only color in the
world, anymore. Everything else
was black. Black and burned and
filled with unimaginable death. He
shut his eyes, wishing it was a
dream. And when he woke again it
was night.
(pause)
At first he thought a snow had
fallen. Everything that had been
black was white now. And moving.
And then he felt them. All up and
down his legs, the burnt flesh.
There were maggots, millions,
everywhere, covering the city like
a winter snow. He told me in that
moment he knew that it was nature,
life, rising back from death. From
one hundred and fifty thousand
women and children and men.
(looks to Stenz)
That day we burned the world. That
night, nature took it back.

94.

EXT. DOWNTOWN SAN FRANCISCO - DAY
Ford touches down with a not-too-graceful stutter-step at the
center of the rubble-strewn Financial District. He quickly
ditches his parachute and hustles round a corner to find -A dozen soldiers already assembled, with FOUR WEAPONS TECHS.
The JUMP SGT signals fast to follow him. No time to wait.
JUMP SGT
This way, this way!
They move off briskly, as Ford readies his rifle on the run.
EXT. COLUMBUS-BROADWAY INTERSECTION - DAY
The site of the sinkhole is now a crater piled with debris.
The Femuto is burrowed in her “NEST.” Secretion oozes,
encrusting the ICBM and HER BIOLUMINSECENT SPORE.
Eerily, electricity around the female sparks and flickers
with sporadic life. A CAR RADIO sputters out discordant pop.
MORE SOLDIERS
are now converging from all sides of the wide intersection.
Trading forlorn looks. Ford glances to the SGT: What now?
EXT. FINANCIAL DISTRICT - DAY
Godzilla pins the Hokmuto against a LARGE, MULTI-STOREY CARPARK, pummelling him brutally -- until the structure
collapses, burying the parasite in rubble.
Looming over the Hokmuto, Godzilla opens his mouth as wide as
it will go, emitting a turbulence current of shimmering
thermal waves. There is just enough time to register LIGHT
SPARKING within his cavernous maw, and then as he ROARS --- something happens we have not yet seen in person:
GODZILLA VOMITS OUT A FOUNT OF BLINDING BLUE-WHITE FIRE!
INT. TRANSAMERICA TOWER LOBBY - DAY
Elle holds Brody close as -- GODZILLA’S ATOMIC BREATH
BLISTERS DOWN LIKE NAPALM ON THE STREET OUTSIDE.

95.

EXT. FINANCIAL DISTRICT - DAY
The Hokmuto flaps up into the air to escape Godzilla’s brutal
incendiary assault -- but FREEZES MID-TAKE-OFF. Godzilla’s
JAWS HAVE CLAMPED DOWN ON ONE OF ITS FOUR SMOLDERING WINGS.
The Hokmuto HISSES, then FLUTTERS INTO A FRENZY, trying to
loose its wing. The animal BUCKS and TWISTS, pelting the
area with BROKEN SCALES and SALIVA -- but Godzilla holds.
Enraged, the Hokmuto FLINGS ITSELF AWAY IN PAIN -- WITHOUT
ONE WING! The massive appendage, shed clean, REMAINS IN
GODZILLA’S MOUTH. Godzilla drops the wing, which is still
WRITHING. He SNARLS at the Hokmuto:  “I DID THIS TO YOU.”
The Hokmuto HOWLS DEAFENINGLY IN AGONY.
EXT. COLUMBUS-BROADWAY INTERSECTION - DAY
The creature battle is audible from here, but the Femuto
remains motionless. Still crouched above the ICBM. Until
suddenly: THE HOKMUTO’S HOWL OF PAIN ECHOES across the city.
THE FEMUTO SPRINGS TO ATTENTION,
quickly lifting her enormous frame on her four hind legs and
trundling off in the direction of her pained mate’s call...
Ford and the other soldiers dive aside to dodge her CRUSHING
FOOTFALLS, several unsuccessfully -But with the Femuto gone, the “nest” is left unguarded. Four
weapons technicians immediately descend the crater towards
the ICBM, wedged in next to the Muto’s GIANT SPORE.
They get to work as Ford and the other troops surround the
burrow, standing watch. The SGT checks his stop-watch:
08:34:00...

08:33:00...

08:32:00...

INT. USS HARRY S. TRUMAN - TAC-OPS CENTER - DAY
The same TIMER COUNTING DOWN. As Honda and Stenz return to
look on, breathlessly. Along with Bayer and the others. No
adversaries, anymore. Everyone just praying for survival.
EXT. FINANCIAL DISTRICT - DAY
Godzilla FURTHER BULLIES a downed Hokmuto, body-checking and
tail-lashing the grounded parasite until, finally, he stands
above his soon-to-be vanquished opponent.

96.

Fury flashes in Godzilla’s eyes. But this time as Godzilla
unhinges to unleash a final, fatal blast of atomic fire -THE BLUE FLAMES SNUFF OUT COMPLETELY. The ignition current
in his throat SHORT-CIRCUITS with a FEEBLE CLICK-CLICK.
ANGLE ON GODZILLA
Smoke seethes from his nostrils.
Turning slowly back to see --

But now he is confused.

THE FEMUTO HAS ARRIVED; it was her magnetism that shorted out
his flame. She HISSES ANGRILY -- while the Hokmuto flaps up
behind Godzilla on his three remaining wings, incensed.
Godzilla is trapped between them.
FEMUTO SLAMS DOWN HER GIANT FORELIMBS, as HOKMUTO CLAPS HIS
MASSIVE WINGS -- generating a COMBINED SHOCK-WAVE so intense
it STUNS GODZILLA where he stands. He staggers, dazed.
Then BOTH MUTOS POUNCE.
EXT. COLUMBUS-BROADWAY INTERSECTION - DAY
Ford and the other troops stiffen on their rifles, LISTENING
to the monstrous cacophony. It is clear even from a distance
that the tide has turned. While down in the “nest” -THE WEAPONS TECHS
are dismantling the CONE TIP OF THE ICBM TO EXPOSE -- THE
INNER NUCLEAR WARHEAD. They carefully LIFT IT BY ITS HANDHOLDS and slide it from the larger missile tube.
Its COUNTDOWN TIMER ticking down:
06:55:00...

06:54:00...

06:53:00...

As the techs continue on their work; a long, complex process.

A

EXT. FINANCIAL DISTRICT - DAY
GODZILLA PIN-BALLS DOWN THE RUBBLE-LINED STREET, choking on a
blizzard of swirling ash -- but THE HOKMUTO AND FEMUTO allow
no respite, out-matching him from land and air.

97.

THE FEMUTO SINKS HUGE FANGS INTO HIS TAIL. Payback for her
mate. Godzilla lets out a PAINED ROAR as electricity ripples
his body, preventing him from summoning his atomic breath.
HONDA (PRE-LAP)
The female is shorting out Gojira’s
heat release.
INT. USS HARRY S. TRUMAN - TAC-OPS CENTER - DAY
SATELLITE FEEDS provide partial glimpses of the action.
HONDA
If they keep him on land long
enough, his body could go into
meltdown.
EXT. FINANCIAL DISTRICT - DAY
The combined efforts of the Mutos bring Godzilla to his
knees. The Hokmuto GOUGES FROM ABOVE, as the Femuto twines
her massive limbs around Godzilla’s throat, choking him out.
Godzilla struggles mightily, but his efforts are diminishing.
INT. TRANSAMERICA TOWER LOBBY - DAY
Elle and Brody brace with each concussion from outside. The
lobby swirls with dust and smoke. But then they notice:
BRODY
Look!
THOUSANDS OF TWENTY-DOLLAR BILLS are floating through the air
like falling leaves. Elle looks across the lobby to see the
money is fluttering from the open doors of a BANK VAULT.
She hoists Brody to support him and they take off running.
EXT. COLUMBUS-BROADWAY INTERSECTION - DAY
Back at the female’s nest. Weapons techs continue their
methodical work, sweat pouring down their brows. As they
fire up ELECTRIC DRILLS to unscrew a COMBINATION PANEL --- the NEARBY MUTO SPORE ripples with STATIC ELECTRICITY. As
if sensing the electric charge. Ford notices. Then sees:

98.

THE FEMUTO, IN THE DISTANCE,
reacting to the signal from her spore. It distracts her,
momentarily. Like a spider sensing a disruption of her web.
Ford rushes to the spore and POUNDS IT WITH HIS RIFLE BUTT -more static ripples its surface. The Femuto reacts again.
FORD
Come on, gimme a hand with this!
The SGT and some other TROOPS rush up to join him. All
pounding at the shell. Ford retrieves a PAIR OF BOLT-CUTTERS
from his back-pack and JAMS THEM THROUGH THE HARDENED SPORE --- ELECTRIC SPARKS EXPLODE FROM THE SHATTERED SHELL!
EXT. FINANCIAL DISTRICT - DAY
The female reacts in shock, sensing the destruction of her
spore. She swivels back, momentarily forgetting Godzilla -Who seizes the brief advantage, and as the Hokmuto dive-bombs
for another three-winged attack -- THIS TIME GODZILLA LASHES
OUT AND SNAPS HIS JAWS AROUND THE CREATURE’S THROAT. BITING
DOWN SO HARD HE CRUSHES THE HOKMUTO’S GIANT SKULL.
THE FEMUTO SPINS BACK
in utter fury. As her mate, the Hokmuto, flops lifeless to
the ground. She REARS UP AND CHARGES AT GODZILLA -- driving
his body right through the TRANSAMERICA TOWER.
INT. TRANSAMERICA TOWER LOBBY - DAY
The entire building QUAKES MASSIVELY from the fatal blow.
Columns buckle, shards of concrete hailing down... Elle and
Brody have not quite made it to the BANK VAULT, when -EXT. TRANSAMERICA TOWER - DAY
The entire skyscraper COLLAPSES IN UPON ITSELF -- completely
entombing Godzilla (and Elle and Brody) in debris.
EXT. COLUMBUS-BROADWAY INTERSECTION - DAY
Ford and the other troops are thrown from their feet by the
resulting shock-wave. Then a CLOUD OF CONCRETE DUST BLASTS
THROUGH, ENSHROUDING THE ENTIRE AREA in blinding smoke.

99.

The SOUND alone has a concussive impact, temporarily TOPPING
OUT OUR AUDIO TRACK. All we can hear is a shrill, tinnitus
ringing. Dust and debris consume us.
ANGLE ON FORD
He is trapped beneath a pile of brick and twisted rebar.
Writhing soldiers surround him on all sides. The warhead
rests ten yards away. Its LIGHTS STILL BLINKING, counting
down. Several weapons techs lay dead beside it.
Ford struggles, but his boot has been impaled by rebar. He
quickly yanks and tugs it off, freeing his foot. He crawls
to the warhead. By now, THREE MORE SOLDIERS have come to,
gathering around. None with any clue of what to do.
JUMP SGT
The techs are gone...

It’s over.

Just then, the SOUND of a massive INHALATION up above them.
The dust cloud itself begins to CHURN. Offering vague
glimpses of THE FEMUTO’S TERRIFYING SILHOUETTE -AS SHE UNLEASHES A BLOOD-CURDLING HOWL!
A hurricane force blast of air blows right through the dust
and smoke, clearing the sky above the intersection. Then:
THE FEMUTO POUNCES
on her burrow. Dozens of soldiers open fire futilely, as she
swipes and stomps them. Finding her spore destroyed. The
ICBM tube is empty -- its warhead has been removed.
FORD’S POV: A SWATH OF BUILDINGS has been flattened, giving
onto a clear path to San Francisco Bay, just down the hill.
He looks to the warhead.
4:22:00...

The Femuto hasn’t seen it yet.
4:21:00...

4:20:00...

FORD
(to OTHER SOLDIERS)
Quick! The Bay!
Ford and THREE OTHER SOLDIERS hoist the warhead by its handholds, two-to-a-side. Hurrying down the steep, debris-strewn
hillside towards the Bay...
THE FEMUTO
quickly pivots on her feet.
of the warhead.

Sensing the escaping radiation

100.

EXT. FISHERMAN’S WHARF - DAY
Sparks fly off the bottom chassis of the warhead, as Ford and
the soldiers drag it, bumping down the PIER and onto -THE DECK OF A “SEE-THE-BAY TOURS” BOAT
tied up in a slip. Ford runs into the cabin. The key hangs
in the ignition. The ENGINE REVS to life. Ford jams the
throttle -- but the boat just LURCHES FORWARD TO A STOP.
It is still hitched to its DOCK LINE!
EXT. WHARF DOCK - DAY
Ford leaps out, scrambling for the dock line, but just then,
the tour boat’s ENGINE SHORTS OUT WITH A SIZZLING SPARK.
The dock line goes lax.
THE FEMUTO
has arrived, towering above the wharf. STATIC FLICKERS
across her hide, shorting out the tour boat’s engines.
ON THE TOUR BOAT,
the other soldiers open fire, unloading their M16s in a
final, futile hail of glory -But the Femuto casually CLEARS THEM ALL WITH A SINGLE, FATAL
SWIPE, shearing the covered top clean off the tour boat.
FORD IS LEFT ALONE,
stranded on the dock. His M16 RUNS OUT OF AMMO. Then he
drops it limply, and slumps, exhausted to his knees.
The battle is over.
THE FEMUTO LOWERS IN,
her enormous head sniffing at him. Sensing Ford by electroreceptivity. Saliva oozes from her fangs.
Ford has no place left to go, nothing left to do but face
this monster nose to nose. And glare. But just then...
Ford’s expression shifts. Almost the hint of a smile.
Sensing something there behind her.

101.

FORD
(to himself, in disbelief)
King of the fucking monsters.
AND AS THE FEMUTO UNHINGES HER UNGODLY, SLAVERING JAWS TO
ROAR --- THE ROAR OF ANOTHER MONSTER CUTS HER OFF, INSTEAD,
drowning out her feeble howl with a deafening, commanding
bellow accompanied by blistering waves of heat.
IT IS GODZILLA, KING OF THE MONSTERS!
Swaying on his feet behind the female, bleeding and battered,
many of his dorsal plates cracked or broken off completely.
Like a twelfth-round boxer, ready for his final stand.
And if the Femuto could make an “Oh, shit” expression, it
would be right now, as -WHAM!!!
GODZILLA SWIPES CLEAN THROUGH THE FEMUTO with a single, fatal
blow, SNAPPING THE HEAD CLEAN OFF HER NECK. The enormous
parasite crumples, crashing to the wharf -- deceased.
Then the great Godzilla drops to a knee, exhausted.
INT. BART SUBWAY PLATFORM - DAY
The massive tremor echoes from the street above, as terrified
citizens huddle in the darkness. But then, unexpectedly:
ELECTRICITY FLICKERS BACK throughout the station. LIGHTS
COME ON AGAIN. With the MUTOs dead, the power has returned.
INT. USS HARRY S. TRUMAN - TAC-OPS CENTER - DAY
SATELLITE FEEDS return as well, as ADM Stenz, Honda and the
rest look on. The COUNTDOWN TIMER IS STILL TICKING:
00:45:00...

00:44:00...

00:43:00...

EXT. WHARF DOCK - DAY
From his position on the dock, Ford watches as ELECTRICITY
RETURNS, block-by-block across the San Francisco skyline.
Then suddenly.

102.

Vroom!!! The tour boat’s engines whir to life! The boat
jolts forward, pulling taut again against its DOCK LINE.
Ford, startled, reaches out and slips the dock line free.
AND THE TOUR BOAT
shoots out onto the waters of the Bay, racing fast away from
shore. Carrying the warhead. But will it be fast enough?
INT. USS HARRY S. TRUMAN - TAC-OPS CENTER - DAY
On the GEOSPATIAL MAP, a RED DOT follows the location of the
warhead as it travels out into the Bay. Its BLAST RADIUS
creeps out with it, receding towards the city’s edge. But
still encircling the downtown area of San Francisco, as:
00:19:00...

00:18:00...

00:17:00...

EXT. FISHERMAN’S WHARF - DAY
Godzilla has COLLAPSED TO A PILE OF RUBBLE, completely spent.
HIS BREATH WHEEZES PAINFULLY with every exhalation.
ANGLE ON FORD
He slumps back, too. Barely strong enough to turn his head.
But his eyes allow one final look upon Godzilla. Somehow,
unexpectedly, his comrade in arms.
Then Ford remembers something. He reaches for the Velcro
pocket of his jump suit. And exactly then -The COUNTDOWN TIMER DETONATES IN A FLASH OF BLINDING LIGHT.
Silence.

Whiteness.

Then.
Gradually. Ever so faintly, colors coming into view. The
outlines of shapes resolving. Faces in a picture. It is the
Maddox-Brody family portrait. Ford grips it tightly in his
fist. Shielding his eyes from the light...
As the last whiteness gradually dissolves to reveal AN EPIC
MUSHROOM CLOUD, billowing up across the Bay.
Ford is alive.

The city has been spared.

And now --

103.

Godzilla’s great chest heaves slightly, then almost seems to
stop... Ford’s eyes shut, too. And at last HE PASSES OUT.
FADE TO BLACK.
EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - VARIOUS - DAY
A new day.

A city in ruins.

But slowly coming back to life.

Fire crews douse flames.
Red cross workers help citizens from BART tunnels.
Bucket brigades of volunteers scour wreckage for survivors.
Officials and civilians have come to gather near the fallen
body of Godzilla. Honda and Stenz are among them. Standing
above the ailing King, as National Guards keep civilians
back.
TV NEWS REPORTERS deliver their take to cameras:
TV REPORTER 1
In a city spared from fallout
by prevailing winds, many
feel another force of nature
protected them today --

TV REPORTER 2
Gathering here to witness the
fallen creature in what may
well be its dying throes --

INT. VA HOSPITAL - DAY
The same reporters on TVs. As INJURED SOLDIERS watch them.
Veterans are being bandaged up. Ford sits among them,
battered, bruised, but still intact. And yet for him, the
worst may not be over. He is on his phone. It is RINGING.
He is trying to reach Elle.
ELLE (ON PHONE)
(recorded)
You missed Elle. Leave me
something beautiful.
Beep.

But Ford has no words left.

HIS TEARS BEGIN TO FALL.

RESCUE WORKER 1 (PRE-LAP)
(shouting)
QUIET!
EXT. WRECKED FINANCIAL DISTRICT - DAY
A bucket brigade is scouring the wreckage.

RESCUE WORKER 2

RESCUE WORKER 3

Quiet!

Quiet!

Silence falls.
And then we hear it.

Faintly.

From beneath the rubble --

The BUZZING OF A PHONE.
INT. VA HOSPITAL - DUSK
Later. OTHER VETERANS have FAMILIES at bedsides. Grateful,
emotional reunions are underway... But Ford has not stopped
calling Elle. And yet, still nothing. Silence on the line.
RECORDED VOICE (ON PHONE)
If you are satisfied with your
message, you may hang up now. To
continue recording, press one. To
erase and rerecord...
Ford, at last, hangs up.

Gives up.

And shuts his eyes.
Then.
ELLE (O.S.)
Hey.
She is standing in the doorway.

Next to Brody, beaming back.

Ford leaps to his feet and the family crashes in together.
No words are spoken.

None are needed.

Tears fall, as they embrace.
Look!

A family again.

VOICES (PRE-LAP)
He’s moving!

EXT. FISHERMAN’S WHARF - DUSK
DEBRIS tumbles aside as Godzilla suddenly EXHALES A MASSIVE
BREATH. His chest heaves. He is awaking.
The crowd of onlookers staggers back. Gaping on in awe.
Godzilla slowly rises from the rubble. Standing tall.
Honda watches from below. In wonderment and awe.

Every eye in the hospital is rapt.
Except for Ford and Elle and Brody.
Theirs are shut too tightly. As they continue to embrace.
Nothing outside that could possibly be more important.
EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - DUSK
Godzilla’s mountainous silhouette sinks back beneath the
surf, swallowed by a brilliant orange sunset.
The churning waters settle back to stillness. It could be a

Nature is at peace.
