WHIRS and HUMS.

The screen flickers.

Splices pop through the gate.
And then, today's feature film:
MONSTERS FROM BEYOND!
The title card is made from cut cardboard, and very
blurry.
MOM (O.S.)
Victor, I don't know that it's...
VICTOR (O.S.)
You have to wear the glasses.
Oh!

MOM (O.S.)
Yes of course.

Thick frames slide past. Now we're looking at the title
card in real 3D. It's very homemade, but charmingly
done.
The next card:
STARRING SPARKY
That's you!

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
Victor's MOM and DAD share the couch with SPARKY THE DOG,
30-odd pounds of canine goodness. They're watching the
homemade movie through vintage 3D glasses.
Behind them run two projectors, manned by the filmmaker
himself, VICTOR. He's more mad scientist than film
auteur -- he built this twin projector system himself.
ON SCREEN
Sparky wears a foam fin on his back as he walks through a
metropolis made of cardboard and found objects.

Victor, so that’s where my

DAD
I’ve been looking for those golf

BACK TO THE SCREEN
Sparky-saur turns, seeing a PTERODACTYL (a plastic toy on
fishing line) flying down from a nearby mountain.
In CLOSE UP, the Pterodactyl’s eyes glow menacingly,
Christmas bulbs flashing.
Defending the city, Sparky-saur jumps up and attacks the
Pterodactyl, shaking it in his mouth.
ANGLE ON SOFA
(The real) Sparky BARKS at the screen, hopping up on the
back of the couch, casting a silhouette on the screen.
DAD
You tell him, Sparky!
Suddenly, one of the projectors JAMS on a splice. The
film melts, then the tail WHIPS AROUND, getting snared in
the second projector's reel. The two machines SMASH
TOGETHER in a shower of sparks.

The FLARE

TOWN - MORNING

In a VERY WIDE SHOT, we establish the suburban paradise
of New Holland. It's a sea of cookie-cutter houses on
cul-de-sac'd streets named after trees.
The town comes complete with its own ersatz Dutch
windmill, which lazily turns on the hillside above.
A BIKE-RIDING PAPERBOY delivers the morning news.
EXT.

VICTOR'S HOUSE / STREET - MORNING

Sparky picks up the newspaper in his mouth, then trots
back to the house, where Victor is waiting.
VICTOR
Morning, Mr. Burgemeister!
Next-door neighbor BURGEMEISTER retrieves his own paper.
The Mayor of New Holland, Burgemeister is slightly OCD
and largely insufferable.
BURGEMEISTER
Your mutt has been sniffing around
my Dutch Dazzlers. And the other
day I caught him peeing on my
flamingo.
VICTOR
I'll keep an eye on him.
BURGEMEISTER
You better, or I’ll get you -- and
your little dog too.
He thinks he’s clever quoting the “Wizard of Oz” -- but
Victor doesn’t get it.
Yes sir.

Victor heads inside.
Sparky trots after Victor.

Burgemeister unfolds the newspaper to read the front
page.
INSERT NEWSPAPER: The headline reads “MAYOR
BURGERMEISTER TO KICK OFF DUTCH DAYS.” A photo shows
Mayor Burgemeister complete with sash and hat.
Burgemeister is pleased with the photo.
WIDER: A girl Victor’s age tries to sneak out of the
house behind Burgemeister.
This is ELSA VAN HELSING. She’s a raven-haired fourthgrader with the soul of a poet.
With eyes in the back of his head...
BURGEMEISTER
And just where are you headed,
Elsa?
She freezes.
ELSA
To school.

A SHADOW falls across him.
He looks up to see WEIRD GIRL standing over him. She has
a fluffy white CAT in her arms, which she strokes idly
like a James Bond villain.

MR. RZYKRUSKI
I am Mr. Rzykruski. I will your
new science teacher. Apparently,
Mr. Holcum had an incident.
Elsa interjects:
ELSA
He got hit by lightning.
This is news to Mr. Rzykruski. The rest of the class,
including Victor and every child we've met so far,
already knew.
MR. RZYKRUSKI
Well. That is bad. But he did
not get "hit by" lightning.

eating a bad chicken dinner, that

He turns to an old Schwinn bicycle mounted on a stand and
starts the wheels spinning. One by one the appliances
start to whir and come alive.
Victor then begins to hoist Sparky up through the sky
light. The rain is beating down and the lightning getting
more intense.
The metal table finally reaches his resting spot under
the swing set.
Now all he can do is wait. He watches the storm intently,
silently urging Zeus' thunderbolts to strike.
He doesn't notice his hair rising up on end. Or how the
other nuts and bolts on his workbench are suddenly pulled
upright.
And then...

A jagged finger of light touches the top of the balloons,
racing down the cord and into the attic Zapping Sparky with a thousand volts.
He removes his swim goggles, and springs right to action

All of the appliances power down and grind to a halt. The
room goes silent.
He swings the table over to the workbench.
Wearing a stethoscope, he listens for a heartbeat.

Back home, everyone is scientist.

Physicist, physicist, chemist,

not make enough scientists.
Always needs more. You should be

Nobody likes scientists.
MR. RZYKRUSKI
They like what science gives them,
but not the questions, no, not the
questions that science asks.
VICTOR
I have a question.
MR. RZYKRUSKI
That is why you are scientist.
Victor smiles, a little.
VICTOR
I was doing my experiment, my

worked great. But the next time
it didn't. I mean, it sort of
worked, but then it didn't. And I

The main square has been transformed into a suburbanite

Oktoberfest, half county fair. There are a few carnival

Windmills and tulips are the most common tchotkes, but
every discernible bit of Dutch culture has been stripped
from the bones and repackaged, from Van Gogh to canals.
