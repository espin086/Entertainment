OVER BLACK we hear the sounds of a TURNTABLE turning on.
We hear a NEEDLE drop. The record plays a SONG.
The SONG is pure, innocent, and simple... the kind of
thing great singer-songwriters are made of.
TEXT:
“The following is kind-of based on a true story a little
bit.”
The words are lifted away in a haze of CIGARETTE SMOKE.

INT. CHIME IN MAGAZINE OFFICES - DAY (1971)

1

We listen to the song as we pick up snapshots from an
office of an early 70’s music magazine:
- Cigarettes are smoked indoors, everywhere.
over cubicles, everywhere.
- Women wear mini-skirts.

Smoke wafts

Really “mini” mini-skirts.

- Music POSTERS and SIGNAGE line cubicle walls.
Dylan. Simon and a Jew-fro’d Garfunkel.

Hendrix.

- A poster of a young RICHARD NIXON. Someone has drawn a
MUSTACHE on Nixon’s face as well as a “SPEECH BUBBLE”
which reads “I’m an asshole.”
- We hone in on a SINGLE CIGARETTE. A hand places it in
an ASHTRAY. The now-empty hand removes the needle from
the record player (stopping the song).
VOICE (O.S.)
Well, it’s a hell of an album,
Kid. People are gonna freak.
The album goes into a SLEEVE and gets placed on a table.
The album’s cover bears only a simple title: Danny
Collins.
The cigarette gets picked back up, and the “voice” takes
his place behind a desk. His other hand picks up a
DICTAPHONE.
VOICE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
(re: recording)
This cool?
Sure.
He hits RECORD.

SECOND VOICE (O.S.)
A PACK OF CIGARETTES are held forward.

VOICE (O.S.)
SECOND VOICE (O.S.)

The pack is pulled back REVEALING for the first time:
OUR INTERVIEWER, GUY DELOACH (36). His style is of the
day and his manner that of a hippie who thinks he knows
everything about anything worth knowing.
DeLoach leans back in his seat. He takes a long drag on
his cigarette as he studies the YOUNG MAN opposite him.
ON THIS YOUNG MAN
Throughout, we see him only in FACELESS SNAPSHOTS.
- Long hair, very much of the era.
- Open collared shirt.

A hairless chest.

- A single gold cross on the hairless chest.
- Those few facial features we can make out are boyish,
untouched by... well, anything.
DELOACH
Jesus H, you’re a baby.
you, sixteen?
Twenty-one.

What are

YOUNG MAN

DELOACH
Jesus H.
(beat, then)
Well the album’s gonna be massive,
Kid. Who got you there?
I’m sorry?

YOUNG MAN

DELOACH
Your influences. Who do you dig?
Who makes you hard?
YOUNG MAN
(uncomfortable)
Oh, well, I-Hold on.

DELOACH

DeLoach picks up the recorder, speaks into it.

DELOACH (CONT’D)
June 30th, 1971, Guy DeLoach with
Danny Collins for Chime Mag.
(then)
More than anything it’s your
writing. You write like fucking
Lennon, man.
DANNY
Oh, well, that’s... thank you.
DELOACH
He’s clearly an influence here,
no?
DANNY
Yeah, I mean... I guess he’s the
one who makes me the hardest?
A beat.

DeLoach LAUGHS, shakes his head.
DELOACH
Jesus H. Well, you’re going to be
huge, Kid. I know the real thing
when I hear it and you’re it.

Danny doesn’t say anything.

DeLoach raises a brow.

DELOACH (CONT’D)
Kid, look at me. I’ve been a starmaker and a star-fucker for a very
long time, and I’m telling you:
You. Are. Going. To. Be.
Huge. Richer than richer, famous
as shit, more women than you know
what to do with. And I’m telling
you this, and I’ve got to ask: why
are you sitting there, staring at
me, looking like that information
scares the living shit out of you?
Danny leans forward, full-frame for the first time.
DANNY
Because it does.

A sign on the dressing room door reads: HEADLINER. In
the distance we hear a dull, thumping ROAR. THUMP.
THUMP. THUMP. A distant crowd awaits their star.
6

INT. DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

6

A HAND fingers a CROSS.
The cross dangles from a chain, half buried in a patch of
gray chest hair. The cross is removed, placed on a table.
The cross OPENS, like a coffin, and dumps a line of
COCAINE on a table.
A NOSE comes into frame, snorts some.
AT THE MIRROR
Preparation for show time:
- GRAY HAIR STRANDS are darkened with HAIR COLORER.
- A GIRDLE is strapped over an undershirt.
- PLATFORM SHOES are stepped into, providing an extra
five inches of height.
7

INT. TUNNEL - MOMENTS LATER

7

From behind, we TRACK our hero as he marches through the
bowels of the arena in his platform shoes - his steps are
wobbly, not exactly in a straight line.
He passes some GIGGLING GIRLS, nods at them. He passes a
few “backstage” types, including a familiar ROADIE.
ROADIE

The CHANTING CROWD

AT THE STAGE CURTAIN/DOOR
From behind, we watch as he pauses. One deep breath.
One crack of the neck, each way. Then:
He gives a THUMBS UP to someone off to the side. The
curtain/door opens as he steps out onto the stage in
front of 20,000 adoring fans.
Needless to say, they go completely bat-shit.

ON STAGE

We stay behind Danny as he strolls forward, takes the
mic, and greets his fans.
DANNY
Thanks for coming, Los Angeles.
It’s good to be home.
The crowd ROARS approval.
DANNY (CONT’D)
I think you might know this one.
Danny turns to his BAND, NODS, and...
LIGHTS BLAST ON!!!

Everywhere.

The crowd ERUPTS.

Our CAMERA SWEEPS over the crowd revealing, in full,
DANNY COLLINS for the first time since he was twenty-one.
He’s still a striking man, but the years have definitely
left their mark.
He wears an impeccably tailored but boldly colored
outfit. And those platform shoes. Equal parts Rod
Stewart and Neil Diamond.
There are instruments everywhere... but Danny’s not
playing any of them.
This is over-the-top spectacle... but not caricature.
The music, the act, it’s cheesy without being cartoony,
campy without being completely void of melody.
It’s pretty clear that the stadium isn’t the only thing
that has sold out.

Danny has clearly led off with his biggest hit, akin to
Sweet Caroline (equally catchy, almost as good). Sweet
Caroline is a good reference actually, mainly because
from the first note (and especially the chorus), the
audience is SINGING ALONG in a call and response fashion
(TWO VIDEO SCREENS even cue the audience to sing their
part with bouncing-ball karaoke-esque prompts).
The CROWD (older) eats it all up. A WOMAN sings his
chorus “Hey, Baby Doll” while also wearing a “Hey, Baby
Doll” T-shirt. ANOTHER WOMAN holds up a sign that reads
“This Granny Loves Danny.”
ON DANNY
During the song he mingles with women in the front row he kisses one woman’s hand, blows a kiss to another. He
makes a show out of giving one woman his SCARF.
Danny takes in...
THE CROWD
AN OLDER COUPLE, arm and arm, SING the response part of
the song back at him. They’re singing way too hard.
THREE OLDER WOMEN sit quietly in their front row seats,
eating RED VINES and mouthing words along, lifeless.
A GROUP OF YOUNG PEOPLE sings along with energy... but
they’re LAUGHING. They’re not laughing with Danny.
ON DANNY
He’s seen it all a thousand times.

It no longer fazes

He pivots with a little shimmy, keeps performing.

INT. DRESSING ROOM - HOURS LATER

Danny SLUMPS in a chair, his dressing room has
transformed into the site of an after-party. Danny
fingers an expensive scotch (and his cross) as he does
his best to stay awake.
TIM, a thirty-something, comes into view through Danny’s
scotch glass.
TIM
Mr. Collins, do you think I could
bother you for a quick picture?
(before Danny can
answer)
Just real quick, my mom will die--

Frank tilts his head, takes Danny in.
FRANK
Hey, Sylvia Plath? You okay?
DANNY
Yeah, I’m fine. Birthday blues or
some shit I guess.
That’s all Frank needs to hear.

He stands.

FRANK
Alright everyone, sorry but my guy
needs a little rest.
No one really listens.
FRANK (CONT’D)
LISTEN UP YOU LEECHES, IT’S TIME
TO GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!
DANNY
Frank, let ‘em be-FRANK
No, Danny, I can name three people
in this room and that’s about
three more than you can.
(to room)
DID I STAMMER, I SAID GET THE FUCK
OUT!
The mumbling crowd begins dispersing. Once they’re gone,
Danny and Frank sit in silence for a moment. Then:
FRANK (CONT’D)

mandated depression has to set in.

DANNY
You see the Golden Girls sitting

liquorice the entire time?
FRANK
Can’t choose your fans, Danny.
DANNY
Three of them. Each of them older
than the next. Made one pack of
liquorice last the entire show.
Just sat there gumming it for two
hours.
This hangs there.

Frank tries cheering him up.

FRANK
New billboard went up on Sunset
for the album. You should check
it out on the way home.
Danny nods, staring off into space.

Frank STANDS.

FRANK (CONT’D)
Alright, enough of this crap.
It’s your birthday tomorrow,
that’s your big problem? Pregnant
women in Africa, feeding half
their village from their
titties... those ladies have
problems. Not you.
Danny smiles weakly.
No, I know.

DANNY
You’re right.

FRANK
‘Course I’m right, I’m always
right. So go home to your
stunning half-your-age fiancé
who’s throwing you the massive
surprise party tomorrow that I
didn’t just tell you about. Then
come tell me and the sore tittied
African ladies about all your
problems.
Okay.

I/E. DANNY’S MERCEDES - LATER

It’s a preposterous car for anyone... let alone a man in
his sixties. Silver on the outside, leather everywhere
on the inside, it’s a spaceship on wheels.
Inside: Danny, exhausted, does everything he can to keep
his eyes from closing as he navigates Los Angeles
traffic.

INT. DANNY’S MERCEDES - LATER

Danny eases the car up to the GATE of a MANSION. He
tries using his “clicker.” It doesn’t work. He SIGHS,
TOOTS the horn.
In the booth of the guardhouse stands a DOORMAN,
currently talking on a HOUSE PHONE. This is MARTY
(40’s). Marty holds up a finger (”Be with you in a
second”).
Danny parks, waits. After a beat, Marty hangs up and
approaches. Danny SIGHS, lowers the window.
MARTY
We gotta get that fixed for you,
Mr. Collins. Good show tonight?
DANNY
It was, thanks.
MARTY
Calling it early? No after-party?
DANNY
Little tired. Just looking to hit
the sack so...
He motions at the gate.

Marty doesn’t take the hint.

MARTY
What’d you open with tonight?
DANNY
Same as always.

Marty nods.
MARTY
Have a good night, Mr. Collins.
Marty walks toward the gate, hits a BUTTON. It opens,
revealing SHANGRI-LA. Is this a home or a “Four
Seasons”? Danny literally has to cross a “bridge” to get
to his home.

INT. MANSION FOYER - MOMENTS LATER

Danny ENTERS the house.
I’m home!

No response. Danny heads toward the tall staircase,

An ELEVATOR, which carries him upwards.

He shakes his head, thrown by the sight, and turns to go.
Then he stops, remembering:
DANNY
Oh, yeah: the kid out front, can

don’t need a half hour of chitchat
every time I pull into my house.
SOPHIE
He’s just trying to impress you.

Sophie SHRUGS, continues her grooming.

INT. DANNY’S HOME STUDIO - LATER

It’s a great space. A PIANO sits dead center. It’s
obvious, however, that the room is not used often.
ON THE WALLS:
Covered in PLATINUM ALBUMS and framed copies of Danny’s
records. The cover art on the albums tells a story from that first SIMPLE ALBUM to the “look” he’s developed
over the past decade or two (same typeface, posing,
etc.).
Danny ENTERS the room, looks around, and spots what he’s
looking for: a BOX OF EMBOSSED STATIONARY PAPER. He
carefully opens the box. Grabs a sheet. It’s blank.
They’re all blank.

Catches sight of himself in the studio mirror:

reading glasses, trying to write something original after
what’s clearly been a long hiatus from just that.
ON DANNY
Realizing. He stops, unwilling to go further. You can
see it in his eyes. What’s the point? He puts down the
pen, leans back, and closes his eyes.
He falls asleep sitting up.

INT. DANNY’S MERCEDES (IN FRONT OF MANSION) - NEXT DAY
Danny pulls up to the house. Sophie holds leftovers in
her lap; she’s dressed in something super revealing.
Danny wears something that makes him look like a mid-60’s
pimp.
You can imagine the looks they got at the restaurant.
SOPHIE
Good birthday brunch, Baby?
DANNY
(nodding)
Good birthday brunch.
She kisses his cheek.

He smiles at her.

DANNY (CONT’D)
So how many people are inside?
Dammit!

SOPHIE
Fucking Frank!

Danny SIGHS.
DANNY
Honey: you can’t surprise a man my
age. You want to give me a heart
attack or something?
She motions at her ring finger.
SOPHIE
Not until it’s legal.
Funny.

DANNY

SOPHIE
Uch, I’m so pissed at him!
Sophie reaches into her purse, pours a line of coke on
the dash, bends forward and does some.

Sophie exits the car and scampers after him (attempting
to fix her dress as she scampers).

INT. MANSION - MOMENTS LATER
They ENTER the house to a huge:
Surprise!

CROWD

The main living area is full of GUESTS. Danny feigns
shock, looks to Frank, front and center. Frank motions
to him: “act surprised.”
DANNY
No way! Are you kidding me!?
(to Sophie)
You did this?
But Sophie’s already hopped up, barely listening, rubbing
her nose and sniffling. Danny covers her behavior by
hugging her. The CROWD AWWWWES.
DANNY (CONT’D)
(putting on a show)
Don’t you all know you don’t
surprise a man my age? You could
have given me a heart attack!
Everyone LAUGHS. Someone CUES Danny’s MOST FAMOUS SONG
(the one we saw him open the concert with).
DANNY (CONT’D)
I think I know this one!

As Danny goes through the motions in snapshots.
- He watches OLDER MEN ogle YOUNGER WOMEN frolicking in
his pool.
- He and Frank watch as TWO YOUNG GUESTS ransack his wine
cellar.
- He OPENS gifts, relishes in receiving a bottle of
SCOTCH with a ribbon around it.
- He DOES COKE in the bathroom, alone.
- He watches two IDIOTS pour vodka/white wine in his Koi
pond.
- At one point, he spots Sophie chatting with Marty
outside (the doorman). He watches as she hands him some
CASH.
- He receives the gift of a SCARF from a FAMOUS FRIEND.
He places it in a pile of identical boxes (everyone has
gotten him scarves).
- By the time evening descends on the party, we pull away
from the festivities, ending on Danny’s familiar shoes.
But this time, the shoes are empty.

The party has pretty much cleared out, day has turned

Opposite them, Sophie is passed out on a love seat.

Holy shit, I’ve been holding this

Danny, wait, hold on.
Danny stops opening the gift.
FRANK (CONT’D)
You remember doing an interview,
when you were a kid? Something
called Chime Magazine? Fella
named DeLoach?
DANNY
(confused)
Yeah. Maybe.
FRANK
I don’t know what you’d said to
the guy - you mentioned Lennon,
doesn’t matter. Point is: Lennon
read it! And he wrote you a
letter!
Danny lowers the box, confused.
DANNY
What? Frank, what the hell are
you talking about?
FRANK
John Lennon wrote you a letter,
Pal! In 1971. He sent it to you
at the magazine, care of this
DeLoach guy. DeLoach smells money
- handwritten letter from John
Lennon and all - so he holds onto
it, never tells you. DeLoach
died, he’s not the point. The
point is he sold the letter to a
collector. Can you believe this
shit?

Danny does, slowly. Frank has had the letter framed and

ON THE LETTER
It’s small, handwritten.

Very personalized.

FRANK (CONT’D)
A handwritten letter to you from
John Lennon, written in 1971. Can
you fucking believe it? Read it!
Danny is still processing.

He reads, out loud, slowly:

DANNY
Dear Danny Collins. Yoko and I
read your interview. Being rich
and famous doesn’t change the way
you think. It doesn’t corrupt
your art. Only you can do that.
So what do you think about that,
Danny Collins? Stay true to your
music. Stay true to yourself.
The rest will follow. My phone
number is below. Call me, we can
discuss this. We can help. Love,
John.
FRANK
Crazy, right!? I’ve been sitting
on this thing for months...
As Frank continues rambling excitedly, we PUSH in...
ON DANNY
He’s just staring at the letter. Reading it, over and
over. His world has clearly just rotated on its axis.
A letter from your hero, meant to be delivered to you
when you were twenty-one. Warning you of all the things
you wound up doing and now regret. Forty years too late.
Can you imagine?
CUE SONG: Imagine (TBD) written by John Lennon.
Everything SLOWS as Danny looks around the deck. The
imagery conflicts with the beautiful song: his fiancé,
belching and half-conscious. The hangers-on passed out
everywhere. His preposterously lavish mansion.
Sad, horrific, irony.
The song carries into...

INT. DANNY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Danny lies there holding the letter, still staring at it.
It’s 5:45 AM and he hasn’t slept. He’s slowly

DANNY
I’ll be back late.
She waves a hung-over arm at him.

INT. DANNY’S MERCEDES - EARLY MORNING

Danny drives through Los Angeles. The Sunset Strip, home
to the Roxy, the Whisky. Have you ever driven down
Sunset when there’s not a soul in sight? It’s surreal.
The whole time the letter sits next to Danny, on the
passenger seat. Haunting him.
Danny pulls the car over.

HIS GIANT BILLBOARD. Danny stands in front of it,
miniscule in comparison, taking in the ridiculous picture
of himself winking at/pointing at camera - the oversized
portrait a symbol of every bad decision he’s ever made.
And that does it...
Slowly... ever so slowly: a smile creeps over his face.
He cracks his neck, coming to terms with a decision, and:
He gets back in the car and races off.

Change of plans.
Danny heads through the bathroom into the walk-in closet.
He takes out a SUITCASE, begins packing. Sophie ENTERS.

What are you doing?
Packing.

You can come out! I promise I’m

his small bag.

Where Danny sits at the bar. He’s wearing a customary

furiously. It’s important to note that he’s finally able
to write using hotel stationary and an ordinary hotel
pen, as opposed to his Montblanc and embossed stationary.

DANNY
Hate to tell you, Buddy, but I’ve
been breaking down for forty
years. I’m broken. Ain’t nothing
left to break.

I can’t waste anymore time.

Frank nods, sips his water.

DANNY

Your mom--

Died of cancer ten years ago.
Never married, never spoke about
you except to say it was a wild
thing she did when she was twentythree and got drunk backstage
after a concert. I use her last
name. Anything else?
DANNY
You’re clearly very angry.
TOM
I’m not angry, I don’t care enough
to be angry. I’m thinking about
what I’m going to tell my daughter
about you, and I’m thinking that I
have to be back at work in twenty
minutes. Are we done?
DANNY

An amazing little girl. I wish I
could do more for her. I’d do
anything for that. But yes. If
it makes you sleep better, I’m
happy. Oh, and fuck you, you

Oh, because I work with a bunch of

In 1971, John Lennon read an interview in a small music
magazine. The subject of the interview was a twenty-one
year old musician named Steve Tilston. In the interview,
Tilston admitted wondering if future wealth and fame
might one day hinder his ability to write powerful songs.
And so... John Lennon wrote Steve Tilston a letter.
In the letter, Lennon offered Tilston advice and
friendship, as well as his home phone number.
Steve Tilston did not receive the letter until 2005.
