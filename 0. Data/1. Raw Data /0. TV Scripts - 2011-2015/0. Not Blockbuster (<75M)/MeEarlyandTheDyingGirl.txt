INT. GREG’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

1

A mediocre-looking teenage boy, GREG, is staring in frozen
horror at a computer monitor, the only source of illumination
in the room.
He is lost in thought, and his thoughts are hell.
GREG (V.O.)
I have no idea how to tell this
story.
He types. His typing is labored.
GREG (V.O.)
I don’t even know how to start it.
Like: I guess I could use one of
those classic story-beginning
sentences.
He examines the screen. There’s one line written: “It was the
best of times; it was the worst of times.”
GREG (V.O.)
(becoming agitated)
But what would that even mean? I
mean, obviously somewhere in the
world it’s the best of times for
someone.

INT. SOME GUY’S LIVING ROOM - DAY

2

Some EXTREMELY FORTUNATE GUY is benefitting from all these
things that Greg is describing.
GREG (V.O.)
Like he’s eating all of this insane
Vietnamese food that he just got
for free and the woman who
delivered the food looks exactly
like the hot girl from Pussy Riot
and now she’s situated in the
corner playing unspeakably
beautiful melodies on the harp.
While he’s just going to town on
that food. So yeah. That’s the best
of times. Meanwhile,

INT. NORTH KOREAN DUNGEON - NIGHT - ALTHOUGH WHO REALLY KNOWS
3
WHAT TIME OF DAY IT IS IN THIS HORRIBLE GODDAMNED DUNGEON
A COMPARABLY UNFORTUNATE GUY is the recipient of Greg’s
imagined parade of horrors.
GREG (V.O.)
...some other guy is being tortured
by the North Korean government
specifically by being suspended
over a crocodile-infested pool of
acid, and because it’s acid these
crocodiles are just pissed, and
they’re also piping in that gross
smell you get when they spill a
bunch of milk in the school parking
lot, and this beefy torturer dude
is just punching the hell out of
him. Worst of times. Check.

INT. GREG’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

GREG stares screenward. He has typed the words, “I have no
idea what I am doing.”
He erases them and begins typing again.
GREG (V.O.)
All right. Look. I’ll just start.
This is the story of my senior year
of high school, and how it
destroyed my life, and how I made a
film so bad it literally killed
someone.
Greg finishes typing. The screen says:
“I made a film so bad it literally killed someone.”
Greg is staring blankly at the screen, again.
TITLE CARD: ME & EARL & THE DYING GIRL.
The hot girl from Pussy Riot is back on harp.

INT. CITY BUS - 6:07 A.M., FIRST DAY OF SENIOR YEAR

GREG is slumped in a seat, yawning and absentmindedly eating
something, as the bus rumbles through the darkness.

I/E. SCHENLEY HIGH SCHOOL - BEFORE CLASS

6pt

Schenley High School is a stately, formidable city block of
barred windows and desert-colored brick. It’s a bit like they
made a penitentiary out of a dismantled Gaza pyramid.
As GREG walks through the school - down hallways, in and out
of the band room, etc. - we trail him.
6pt

IN THE FOYER:

6pt

Greg approaches a lone JOCK.
GREG (V.O.)
I used to think about it this way:
Like a continent, Schenley High
School is divided into nations.
Greg and the jock exchange what’s-up head nods.
GREG (V.O.)
Jock Nation.
6pt

IN A VAST GRITTY HALLWAY:

6pt

Greg bumps fists with TWO STONERS, smoothly declining their
offer to look at a YOUTUBE VIDEO.
GREG (V.O.)
Kingdom of Stoners.
6pt

FURTHER DOWN THE HALLWAY:

6pt

JUSTIN HOWELL THE THEATER KID is laughing uproariously and
flirtatiously at a thing Greg has said.
GREG (V.O.)
The People’s Republic of Theater
Dorks.
6pt

IN THE STAIRWELL:

6pt

Greg observes, unnoticed, as two STONERS pelt a JOCK with
ketchup packets and then book it out of there.
GREG (V.O.)
In the typical high school life,
you belong to one nation, which can
never guarantee you total security.
6pt

IN THE HALLWAY:

Blue (6/3/14)

4.

A group of GANGBANGERS smoking cigarettes exchanges sullen
what’s-up nods with Greg.
GREG (V.O.)
But I thought I found a way out.
Get citizenship in EVERY nation.
Get passports to EVERYWHERE.
6pt

IN THE BAND ROOM:

6pt

Greg briefly plays the bass drum in an impromptu jam session
with FOUR OR FIVE BAND KIDS.
GREG (V.O.)
Just be on low-key good terms with
everyone. Casually interact with
them once in a while, in a way that
is invisible to everyone else.
7

IN ANOTHER HALL:

7

Three MEDIOCRE-LOOKING GIRLS are in GREG’S path. One is
quietly but utterly miserable.
FRIEND OF MISERABLE GIRL
The test was today?
The miserable girl nods, wordless; her friends hug her
fiercely, protectively.
GREG (V.O.)
Never commit to an interaction that
won’t be casual or mellow. That’s
like sending troops to Afghanistan.
GREG
(cheerily, hastily)
Ugh! Tests! I’ve been there.
He speeds away-8

IN THE AUDITORIUM:
GREG is watching with polite interest as two GOTHY DORKS,
including SCOTT MAYHEW, play Magic cards.
GREG (V.O.)
Maintain relationships even with
citizens of the most dicked-upon
nations. For example, Scott Mayhew,
the Gothy dork I’m sitting next to
here. It took years of cultivation
to win his trust.
Scott plays a card entitled “Common Highland Berserker.”

GREG
(murmuring respectfully)
Scott, nice berserker.
Icy and sinister, Scott turns his gaze to Greg.
SCOTT MAYHEW
Thank you-9

PARKING LOT, STEPS:

9

GREG is patiently listening to the violent freestyle rapping
of ILL PHIL, a runty neck-tattooed ne’er-do-well.
GREG (V.O.)
Or the universally ostracized Ill
Phil. Truly, a nation of one.
ILL PHIL
They call me Ill Phil /
I’ll bend you to my will /
my will is ill /
and my name is Phil /
for real /
GREG
Yeah, that’s good.
ILL PHIL
(interrupting him)
take you out back behind the mill /
force you to eat a pill /
now you like “what’s the deal” /
“I just got killed”
GREG
Some great rhymes in there.
FREEZE FRAME.
GREG (V.O.)
This all may appear simple.
6pt

REWIND to the FRONT STEPS of school, where this scene began.
6pt
GREG (V.O.)
In fact, it requires thousands of
social calculations per second.
REPLAY the interactions with the JOCK and the STONERS, again
in slo-mo, but this time from GREG’S POV - ROBOGREG sequence.
In his field of vision are SCI-FI VISUALS: bars and charts.
It’s the data with which a high-functioning autistic person
might negotiate the terrifying social world of high school.

INT. CAFETERIA - LUNCHTIME

6.
10

GREG, holding a bagged lunch, is standing inconspicuously at
the entrance of the cafeteria. He is peering at A PLACE OF
TOTAL CHAOS: crowded, dirty, and lawless.
GREG (V.O.)
And there were some places I simply
couldn’t go. Like the cafeteria.
Every last square inch of it was
disputed territory. It was Crimea,
Kashmir, and the Gaza strip all
rolled into one. Also the part of
the Indian Ocean with pirates.
11

INT. MCCARTHY’S OFFICE

11

GREG is eating his lunch in a teacher’s office, next to a
DIMINUTIVE BLACK KID. Above them stands MR. MCCARTHY, a young
teacher with a shaved head and arms sheathed in tattoos. He
is notable for his paradoxically mellow intensity, and for
his LOVE OF FACTS.
He is, to Greg, the only reasonable teacher in all of
Schenley.
GREG (V.O.)
Instead, I always ate lunch in my
history teacher’s office...

Blue (6/3/14)

7.

MR. MCCARTHY
FACT: I will be in 309 for the next
20 minutes. Respect the research.
GREG
(dutifully)
Respect the research.

EARL
(chainsmoker’s rasp)
Respect the research.

McCarthy leaves. Greg hits space bar on McCarthy’s DESKTOP to
unpause a YOUTUBE CLIP (from BURDEN OF DREAMS: THE MAKING OF
FITZCARRALDO). The boys watch and eat, wordlessly.
GREG (V.O.)
...with Earl, whose role in my life
I’m not even going to try to
explain to you right now.
MADISON, probably the hottest girl in school and yet somehow
also a fundamentally decent person, opens a door.
MADISON
Oh hey guys.
GREG
Hi Madison.
MADISON
Greg, how was your summer.
She smiles and touches Greg’s arm. He suppresses a freak-out.
GREG (V.O.)
One last thing. Hot girls destroy
your life. That’s just a fact. It
doesn’t matter if the hot girl is
also a good person. She’s a moose,
you’re a chipmunk, she’s just
wandering through the forest,
oblivious, and she doesn’t even
know that she stomped your head.
BRIEF DISPLAY OF IMAGE OF MOOSE STOMPING CHIPMUNK
Back in Mr. McCarthy’s office, Greg is attempting charm.
GREG
Summer. It’s like... what does that
word even mean? More “summ”?
(beat)
Winter: same deal! More “wint”?!
Mercifully, Earl cuts in.
EARL
McCarthy’s in 309.

Oh great! Thanks guys!
She leaves. Greg gazes wistfully at the closed door.

A KNOCK ON THE DOOR sends him into panic.

GREG’S MOM
(entering)
Honey? Can we come in?
GREG’S PARENTS are in the room now.
GREG’S MOM is a forceful Jewish mom. She believes her son is
the most wonderful person in the world, and also that she
must take frequent intrusive measures to redirect his life.
She is holding a shrinkwrapped COLLEGE DIRECTORY.
Because this is a movie, she is probably sort of hot, but not
egregiously so.
GREG’S DAD, holding the family cat, is a muumuu-wearing
classics professor, a man of profound spacey weirdness. He is
often making a face of thoughtful concentration. This is to
conceal the unfathomable strangeness within.
Why is he thrusting the cat out at Greg? What is the cat’s
role in this impromptu family meeting? Unclear.
GREG
What do you want.
GREG’S MOM
(tearing shrinkwrap)
First, I was going through your
stuff, and I saw you haven’t even
opened your college directory! So,
please. Have a look.

Blue (6/3/14)
GREG
Mom. Don’t go through my stuff.
GREG’S DAD
We discussed it, and she gets to go
through your stuff.
GREG’S MOM
Just have a look! It’s fun! It’s
like a menu for your future!
(paging through,
theatrically)
What are you in the mood for? Could
I interest you in... Penn State?
Pepperdine? Pomona? Ooh--Princeton?
GREG
I’m not getting into
Princeton.

GREG’S DAD
He’s not getting into
Princeton.

GREG’S MOM
Well, not with that attitude.
Victor, you’re just being hostile
because they wouldn’t let you bring
Cat Stevens into Whole Foods.
GREG’S DAD
That establishment practices cat
apartheid, and history will not
judge them kindly for it.
GREG
Mom. Is that it?
GREG’S MOM
It’s not. Honey... your father and
I wanted to talk to you about
something kind of sad.
GREG
What? What happened?

GREG’S DAD
It sucks quite a bit.
ALT: It sucks super hard.
She is crying. Hesitantly, Greg goes over to give her a hug.
Greg’s dad joins the hug. He is working the cat into the hug.
They are all squat-hugging on the floor of Greg’s bedroom.
GREG
Dad, Cat Stevens is biting me.
GREG’S DAD
He’s deeply distraught.
The hug stops. Cat Stevens scampers angrily away.
GREG’S MOM
Honey, Denise and I agreed, Rachel
needs her friends now more than
ever.
ALT: Honey, I was talking to
Denise. And we agreed you were
someone who could really make
Rachel feel better.
ALT: Honey, I was talking to
Denise. And we agreed, Rachel could
really use someone to make her
laugh.
GREG
Oh. Yeah. But, we’re not really-ALT: Mom. You have to remember,

That’s not going to work. She’ll

GREG’S MOM
I’m sorry to be the one to
tell you this, Gregory, but
you do not have a choice in
this particular matter
because you have been given
the opportunity to make a
very real difference in
someone’s life, and if what
you’re choosing to do instead
is just lie around the house
all day like a dead slug then
I am required to step in and
inform you that that is one
hundred percent unacceptable
and if you think that any of
these excuses you’re giving
me is more important than the
happiness of a girl with

Then suddenly she envelopes Greg in her wiry arms.
DENISE

Hi Mrs. Kushner.
DENISE
Denise, Greg. To you, I’m Denise.
GREG

Okay! Good.
Denise leads him inside. On a table in an adjoining room is a
bottle of something, and a glass. Dr. Phil is on.
DENISE
You’re a good kid. You know that?
You’re just a sweet, good-hearted
kid. And handsome.
GREG
I’m not handsome, but thanks.
DENISE
And so modest.

I’m a modest mouse, I guess.

GREG
Uh... So the doctor really
recommends a strong dosage of Gregitor. He thinks you should start
taking it immediately.
RACHEL
You already used that joke.
GREG
No, because last time it was about
Greg-acil, which, if you recall,
comes in convenient gel-tab form-RACHEL
Look. I don’t want you hanging out
with me. I don’t need your stupid
pity. I’m fine. You can just go.
GREG
No no no. You’ve got it all wrong.
I’m not here because I pity you.
I’m here because my mom...

worse)
...is, uh... making me.
Hmmmm.

Yes. Please. Let me hang out with

No, uh... they’d be suspicious or

This pillow is a dude, obviously.
But he reminds me of a pillow we
used to have. Francesca. Similar
coloring. Oof, Francesca. In the
end, we had to give her away. That
whole situation was just... a
problem.
(poker face from Rachel)
But there was also a chemistry
between us that no one could deny.

The world thought it was wrong. But
maybe the world was wrong. Wrong
about what could be, between a
pillow and a boy... who became a

mine, but in a much tougher
neighborhood. His dad’s in Texas,
his mom’s a depressed shut-in, and
his brother Derrick’s dog, Doopie,
will definitely eat me someday.
Derrick chuckles, snaps his fingers, and a GIANT DOG explodes
through the front door, barking furiously. The dog chases
Greg off-camera. YOUNG EARL comes running out after them.
YOUNG EARL
Doopie! Doopie, chill.

YOUNG GREG AND YOUNG EARL happen upon GREG’S DAD, who is
watching Aguirre, the Wrath of God.
GREG (V.O.)
My house has better stuff to do
anyway.
GREG’S DAD
Boys, you’ll want to pay close
attention to this. The insane
conquistador Aguirre is raging
through the jungle, in search of a
golden city that does not exist.
The boys are transfixed. On-screen, Aguirre is freaking out.
GREG’S DAD (CONT’D)
It’s a classic of foreign cinema.
YOUNG EARL

GREG’S DAD is serving the BOYS cuttlefish.
GREG (V.O.)
In addition to the best films, my
house also has the weirdest food.
GREG’S DAD
This is cuttlefish, a sea creature
much like a squid. It is a favorite
East Asian snack food.
YOUNG EARL
(chewing)
Staaaaaaank.
GREG’S DAD
Yes, the smell is odd and repellent
to our Western noses.
GREG (V.O.)
Obviously we come from pretty
different backgrounds. But somehow
we like most of the same things.

YOUNG GREG AND YOUNG EARL are eating more cuttlefish and
trying to watch The Seventh Seal.
Next to them, however, three of their CLASSMATES are munching
Doritos and watching a fourth classmate play PS3.
GREG (V.O.)
And we learned pretty early on that
we were the only ones who liked,
for example, classics of foreign
cinema.

YOUNG GREG AND YOUNG EARL are trying to recreate a scene from
Rashomon. Young Greg has a camera and a boom mike. Young
Earl, dressed like a samurai, is sort of spazzing out.
GREG (V.O.)
Why did we like them? It’s hard to
say. Maybe it’s that they were
weird and often violent, like us.
Or confusing and possibly
meaningless, like life.
Anyway, we liked them so much that
we started making our own.

Okay. Class. Tomorrow, you must

CLASS. RESPECT THE RESEARCH.

Respect the research.
Mr. McCarthy punches his own biceps.
FACTS.

MR. MCCARTHY

Greg approaches him as his classmates file out of the room.
GREG
Mr. McCarthy? Do you know any facts
about, uh, leukemia?
MR. MCCARTHY
(kindly)
Yes. Leukemia is cancer of the
blood and/or bone marrow.
GREG
So it’s pretty spread out in the
body.

MR. MCCARTHY
Own the fact. Yes.
GREG
How soon do people die from it?
MR. MCCARTHY
Well, it’s often very treatable,
bud. Why do you ask?
GREG
You know Rachel Kushner has
leukemia, right?
This silences MR. MCCARTHY.
Also OTHER NEARBY CLASSMATES (including MADISON).
In retrospect, Greg has said this way too loud.
MADISON
Rachel has what?

INT. RACHEL’S BEDROOM - THAT EVENING
GREG is back in RACHEL’S pillow-infested room. She is not
happy. He has his head in his hands.
GREG
I’m, like, innovatively stupid.
RACHEL
Everyone was going to find out
sooner or later. I just hate having
to share everything about myself.
Greg is trying to think of a way to help.
GREG
I’m the exact same way. Check it
out. One thing you can do when you
don’t want to deal with people is
just enter a subhuman state.
Rachel looks at him expressionlessly.
GREG (CONT’D)
Here, pretend you’re someone
annoying.

Hi, Rachel. I’m really sorry you

Rachel does not know what to think of this. It’s definitely
cute. It’s also deeply stupid.
RACHEL
Does that ever work?
GREG
It works all the time. It’s passive
resistance. That’s what Gandhi was
all about.
RACHEL
I’m pretty sure Gandhi never did
the subhuman thing.
GREG
How do you think India achieved
statehood? Try it: uurrrnng
nnnurrrrjjrjjjj.
RACHEL
(smiling)
Nope.
GREG
Come on! It’s easy. Or another
thing you can do is just flat-out
pretend to be dead. Check it out.
Say something annoying to me.
RACHEL
(impersonating another
annoying classmate)
Hi, Rachel. I just wanted you to
remember that your cancer is all
part of God’s plan.
Greg is being flamboyantly dead. Rachel is enjoying this. But
behind her head, a cut-out of HUGH JACKMAN glares at Greg.
HUGH JACKMAN
Yo. Asshole. Just so we’re straight
on this: You’re advising a girl
with cancer to pretend to be dead?
GREG

ignore Hugh Jackman)

No, seriously. Think about what

Greg is now lying there with a horrified look on his face.
HUGH JACKMAN (CONT’D)
I’ve been doing my broody Wolverine
face on this girl’s wall for five
and a quarter years, and at this
point I’m probably only still here
because she’d feel weirdly guilty
or disloyal taking me down, but I’m
goddamned if I’m letting a little
punk like you waltz in here
stupiding up the place-RACHEL
Greg, what’s wrong?
GREG
Uh...
(foolishly)
Sorry, I shouldn’t have told you to
pretend to be dead. It was really
insensitive.
RACHEL
I mean... I’m sick. I’m not dying.
GREG
(panicking)
No yeah obviously but now I’m being
all weird about it, and I can’t get
un-weird, because I’m just an idiot
and despite what you just said I’m
clearly still sitting here thinking
“death death death death death”-Suddenly Rachel enters a subhuman state.
RACHEL

For the first time in his life, a girl has understood him.
GREG

RACHEL
You can’t really think that!
GREG
I don’t think that, I know that.
For a kid like me, best-case for

mouse boys on our doorstep.

Would you like a little cheese?
Sure.

GREG

EARL
Naw, we good.

INT. RACHEL’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
RACHEL is guarded; EARL, unreadable; GREG, malfunctioning.
RACHEL
Hello, Earl.
EARL
Hi, Rachel. I like your room.
RACHEL
Thank you. Greg thinks it’s too
girly.
GREG
No! This room is great! What are
you talking about?
EARL
Course it’s girly. It’s a girl’s
damn room. My room ain’t got no
pictures of James Bond in no thong.
GREG
(laughing nervously)
But if it did... that’d be weird.

Blue (6/3/14)

41.

An uneasy silence.
EARL
So Rachel. We came to check up on
you.
Thanks.

RACHEL

GREG
Yeah, chemotherapy. That really
sucks.
EARL
(shoving Greg)
Dude. Don’t say it sucks.
RACHEL
It does kind of suck.
EARL
Yeah, but you gotta do it, so...
I guess.

RACHEL

By this point Rachel and Earl are both staring at the ground.
Clearly Greg has to say something.
Uhhhhh.

GREG

Earl and Rachel look at him expectantly. Greg literally
cannot think of a thing to say. He opens his mouth and hopes
words will come out.
Buhhhhhh.

GREG (CONT’D)

RACHEL
(beginning to sound
tearful)
You guys can go if you want.
Greg panics.
GREG
We’re on drugs.
EARL
(face in hands again)
Goddamn.
RACHEL
Why are you on drugs?

Blue (6/3/14)

42.

GREG
We’re accidentally on drugs.
RACHEL
Accidentally?
EARL
McCarthy gave us some of his soup-GREG
(hastily)
Mr. McCarthy gave us some of his
totally normal soup. But it was,
uh, the last of the soup. So we had
to go get more. From a restaurant.
On the fifth floor of an office
building. And in the same building
there was a Jamaican embassy.
No one knows where this is going.
GREG (CONT’D)
We got trapped in an elevator with
a Rastafarian. He just hotboxed the
whole elevator. We were in there
for 25 minutes. We had to breathe
the weird marijuana air. Earl. Am I
right.
Earl is utterly disgusted. But he has to go along with it.
EARL
Yeah. That’s what happened.
But thank God: Rachel thinks that these confused, lying boys
are being kind of sweet.
RACHEL
You guys had quite an adventure.
GREG
Being on drugs sucks... and then
being around someone on drugs
sucks... this whole situation sucks
super bad and it’s all my fault-EARL
Man, shut up. Makin errything about
your druggy ass.
(to Rachel)
I’m in the mood for some damn ice
cream. You like ice cream?

Blue (6/3/14)

EXT./INT. TABLE OUTSIDE ICE-CREAM PLACE

EARL and RACHEL are chatting. GREG is utterly absorbed in his
ice cream, holding it several inches in front of his face.
Super: The part where it turns out Earl holds nothing sacred
RACHEL
So you know Greg from class?
EARL
I known Greg ever since we was
little. You know I was in y’all’s
kindergarten, right?
Really?

RACHEL

EARL
Yeah. I remember you. You were the
girl who called Justin Jones
perverted, for showing girls the
birthmark on his butt.
RACHEL
Oh my God! Yes!
EARL
Dude came running up to you. Showed
you his butt. You was all calm.
Said, “Justin. Only perverts show
their butts.” I was right there.
RACHEL
It’s amazing you remember that.
EARL
You was a hero. Shut his perverted
ass right down. Never forget it.
RACHEL
So you and Greg are coworkers?
EARL
Naw, we friends. He just hates
callin anyone his friend. Dude’s
got issues.
RACHEL
Yeah! He does! What’s going on?
EARL
Man, I don’t even know. Might be
his folks. Dude’s mom always tellin
him how handsome he is, which... he
ain’t.
(MORE)

Blue (6/3/14)
EARL (CONT'D)
So he think he can’t trust nobody
who’s close to him. Dude’s weirdass dad don’t socialize with nobody
cept the cat. So that’s a role
model ain’t got no friends.

44.

Bottom line, dude’s terrified to
call anybody his friend. Because
they might say, hold up, bro. I
ain’t your friend. And then he’d
have to kill himself.
RACHEL
Wow.
(beat)
But how are you “coworkers”?
Earl regards her and silently comes to a decision.
EARL
Well, we uh... we make films.
Movies?

RACHEL

EARL
Yeah. We been makin em for years.
We made like 42 films in total.
RACHEL
Greg, you never told me!
GREG’S POV:
Rachel’s voice is indistinct, underwater. He cannot hear much
over the “MURMF ORMF RUMF” sound of his own rapturous eating.
Also the beautiful harp music is playing.
BACK TO THIRD-PERSON:
Greg nods briskly, goes “mm-hmm,” and goes back to eating.
EARL
We ain’t told nobody about em. They
suck. I mean, they’re terrible.
RACHEL
There’s no way they suck.
Again, Earl appraises Rachel before speaking.
EARL
Well, you can see em for yourself
if you want.

Blue (6/3/14)

45.

RACHEL
(knowing that this is a
big deal)
Are you sure?
EARL
Hell yeah! Don’t even worry bout
it. Just don’t be tellin nobody.
RACHEL
Of course I won’t.
Earl stands up, pulling Greg up with him.
EARL
Aight, son. Get on your feet.
GREG
Sounds good.
(beat)
Where are we going?

INT. GREG’S TV ROOM - TWENTY MINUTES LATER

The three of them are watching a Gaines/Jackson film. EARL is
stony-faced. RACHEL is enjoying it hugely.
GREG looks ill.
42

EXT. SIDEWALK IN FRONT OF GREG’S HOUSE - AFTERWARD
RACHEL is about to walk back to her house. GREG is still
despondent.
EARL
We can walk you home RACHEL
(indicating Greg, happily)
He needs to recover, and you
probably need to help.
ALT: I think you guys might need
some alone time.
EARL
That’s true.
She hugs Earl, and turns to Greg Thanks.

RACHEL

She walks away, radiant.

Sure.

GREG

Blue (6/3/14)

46.

They sit there in silence, Earl serene, Greg fuming. GREG’S
DAD appears behind them and mutely hands each of them a pig’s
foot to eat.
GREG (V.O.)
So we’re pretty far into this
stupid story now, and you’re
probably saying to yourself, “Hey.
I like this girl Rachel, and I’m
gonna be pissed if she dies at the
end.” So I’m just telling you:
Don’t freak out. She survives. When
I said someone dies, I meant
someone else.
So hopefully that reassures you.
Although actually, why would it.
43

INT. MCCARTHY’S CLASSROOM - A FEW DAYS LATER
MR. MCCARTHY sips from his thermos.
MR. MCCARTHY
Guys. I’m asking for one fact. This
is probably the easiest thing you
have been asked all day. Anyone. No
one has a fact. Great. I’ll just
call on you at random. Scott.
Scott Mayhew is not psyched about being called on.
Fortunately, he has a focal point for his irritation.
SCOTT MAYHEW
Fact: Greg was telling everyone
that your soup has marijuana in it.
The class now is stunned/giggly.
GREG
I didn’t tell anyone!!
SCOTT MAYHEW
Greg, you are a liar and a coward.
I heard you bellowing about it on
public transit.
MR. MCCARTHY
Greg? Is that factual?
GREG
(defensively)
Look. I’m sorry. But yesterday,
Earl and I got stoned somehow. And
it was after we both ate your soup.
(MORE)

43

Blue (6/3/14)
GREG (CONT'D)
And we didn’t smoke any marijuana,
which I never have done. So, your
soup must have had drugs in it.
Because that was the only thing we
both ate, other than the cookies
that Earl got from Ill Phil... the,
uh, drug dealer... Aha.
44

EXT. IN FRONT OF THE SCHOOL - THAT AFTERNOON

47.

GREG and EARL are exiting the school together.
GREG
How did you not realize it was the
cookies.
EARL
It was your stupid ass yellin shit
on the bus!
But behind them, the PRINCIPAL, and a SECURITY GUARD burst
through the door, escorting an angry, struggling ILL PHIL off
the premises.
ILL PHIL
Greg! Did you snitch on me?
GREG
What? No, of course not.
SCOTT MAYHEW has positioned himself nearby.
SCOTT MAYHEW
(to Ill Phil)
He did snitch on you. I was there.
GREG
Scott, what the hell.
Scott draws close to Greg. He is a lot taller than Greg.
SCOTT MAYHEW
I heard you ridiculing me in front
of your loathsome harem.
(whispering intensely)
Greg, I trusted you. You betrayed
my trust. You trampled my dignity.
GREG
It was like one time.
SCOTT MAYHEW
You have made a mortal enemy. I
will never stop hounding you.

Blue (6/3/14)

48.

ILL PHIL
You got two mortal enemies.
(whispering into Greg’s
other ear)
I stabbed a dude.
Jesus.

GREG

ILL PHIL
(breaking determinedly
into a flow)
Kill you twenty different ways /
Stab you with blades /
Shoot you with death rays /
Abandon you in a maze /
Choke you on mayonnaise /
The security guard drags him away.
Greg and Earl turn to Scott Mayhew.
SCOTT MAYHEW
He, too, will never stop hounding
you.
Scott Mayhew spits on the ground near them and strides away.

EXT./INT. RACHEL’S HOUSE/BEDROOM - AFTER FIRST ROUND OF CHEMO
45
- NOVEMBER
GREG is visiting RACHEL, and trying not to freak out about
how bad she looks. She is wearing a fuzzy pink hat. Her eyes
are red-rimmed and her skin is pale.
Super: The part where I hit on a girl who just had chemo
GREG
...so it’s been a month, and they
haven’t really done anything, but
they did say, they’re never gonna
stop hounding me, so, sooner or
later, y’know... gonna get hounded.
RACHEL
(distractedly)
Mmmm.
Greg looks around. All of the horizontal surfaces of her room
are overflowing with flowers and cards.
GREG
Sorry. Next time I’ll bring
flowers.
(MORE)

Blue (6/3/14)
GREG (CONT'D)
Although where would I even put
them? The only place left is the
barf bucket.

48A.

Blue (6/3/14)

49.

Rachel doesn’t laugh at this.
GREG (CONT’D)
(helpfully)
Ha ha! Flowers, where you barf.
Still nothing.
GREG (CONT’D)
So, nice hat. It’s pretty cute.
She looks at him. Then she erupts, miserably-RACHEL
Look. I was never very beautiful.
And that was fine, because that’s
not important to me. But I thought
it’d be easier--to look like this,
and it’s just not. Everyone comes
in here and sees me--and they’re so
clearly repulsed--and it’s so much
harder than I thought it would be-GREG
No. Come on. You look good.
RACHEL
I look ugly... I’m so ugly, Greg.
(gathering herself)
I just feel very naked. I feel like
my body’s on display, like some
terrible exhibit: Girl With Cancer.
(thoughtfully)
It’s your worst nightmare actually,
being exposed like this-Something shuts her up. She stares at Greg.
He is nervously fondling her boob.
She closes her eyes, and for a moment he thinks it is because
she is enjoying it.
But she is not.
RACHEL (CONT’D)
Greg... no.
GREG
I’m not doing this because it might
be your last chance to be with a
man. I’m doing this because I can’t
control myself.
(beat)
I want to play with those titties.

Blue (6/3/14)
RACHEL
(now really starting to
break down)
(MORE)

49A.

Blue (6/3/14)
RACHEL (CONT'D)
Everyone feels like they have to
lie to me--and no one realizes how
insulting that is--everyone thinks
they’re helping--and they’re not--

50.

GREG
Sorry. Okay. It’d just be helpful
to know what you want.
RACHEL
There’s nothing you can give me.
It’s fine. Just go.
They lock eyes. He closes his.
Then he rummages around in his backpack. He comes up with a
DVD, and hands it to her.
GREG
(muttering)
This one is called Mono Rash. It’s
based on Rashomon. By Kurosawa. The
plot is just Earl killing people.
Because he has a rash. From mono.
The STD. It’s really not very good.
(beat)
The fight scene at minute 26 is
probably the best part.
Beat.
RACHEL
You don’t mind someone else
watching your movies?
GREG
Of course I mind! I’d rather be
tortured by North Koreans! But...
you know.
Another beat. Then Rachel smiles.
RACHEL
You want to play with these
titties.
GREG
I do. Both titties. They’re both
equally great.
Her smile broadens-GREG (CONT’D)
I should go. We’re supposed to work
on our homage to Apocalypse Now.
(beat)
(MORE)

Blue (6/3/14)
GREG (CONT’D)
Ours is called A Box O’ Lips, Wow.
So. That’s even worse than Mono
Rash.

Blue (6/3/14)
GREG (CONT’D)
I should just stay and talk you out
of watching this--

51.

RACHEL
No! I’ll be fine. Go make it.
GREG
I mean, we really shouldn’t. It’s a
war movie, where the two main guys
take part in the unspeakable
brutality of war and then find a
box of tulips. Box o’ ‘lips. Yeah.
They find it and are wowed. They
just can’t get over how great these
tulips are. So, “A Box O’ Lips,
Wow.” The worst part is, tulips
might not even be in the budget
anymore Please.
Okay.

RACHEL
GREG

He does not move. A beat.
GREG (CONT’D)
Have fun watching this incredibly
terrible movie.
RACHEL
Have fun making the next one.

EXT. EARL’S BACKYARD - AFTERNOON

GREG and EARL are having a heated production meeting.
Earl is dressed in a makeshift soldier outfit, complete with
gun. Greg has an armful of paratroopers.
DERRICK, seated on the porch with a leashed Doopie, watches
them with disdain.
GREG
...so you’re telling me we have no
tulips AND no explosives.
EARL
Doopie ate em.
DERRICK
Ha HA. DOOP’D.

Blue (6/3/14)

52.

GREG
Of course he did. Okay. I’ll get
explosives, you get tulips, meet
you back here in an hour EARL
Aw hell no. C’mon, man. I got a
problem set GREG
Me too! I’ve got like twenty! I’m
not gonna do any of them. I just...
have them.
Earl ponders their predicament.
EARL
Ima pitch you on something: Do we
need tulips?
GREG
I can’t believe I’m hearing this.
Earl. It’s A Box O’ ‘Lips, Wow. The
box of tulips is the entire point.
(spiralling out)
We’re gonna lose the light, your
brother insists on being in the
shot DERRICK
I’m the key grip!
ALT: (Bane voice) When it is done,
and Gotham is ashes, then you have
my permission to die.
GREG
- Dad’s using the good camera, that
dog always freaks me out, this is a
nightmare, why are we doing this.
MADISON
Oh my God! Are you guys making one
of your movies right now?!
What. Where the fuck did MADISON come from. She is leaning
against the chain-link fence, beaming at them.
All three boys stare at her: Greg in horror, Earl in
confusion, Derrick with undisguised appreciation.
MADISON (CONT’D)
Oh my God. I’m on set right now. I
can’t handle it. Action!! Cut!!!

Blue (6/3/14)
GREG
This isn’t a movie! It’s just a...
(what could this even be?)
I’ve been kidnapped!!
EARL
(ignoring Greg)
Madison what you doin round here?
MADISON
(letting herself into the
backyard)
I was just visiting Rachel, and she
was watching one of your secret
movies, and first of all, I have to
say it is so so sweet of you guys
to let her see them. She wouldn’t
even let me see them! So I know
they’re 100% a huge secret.
GREG
I haven’t actually been kidnapped.
MADISON
I know. This is the biggest secret
ever. Greg, I’m just so touched by
how good of a friend you’re being
to her.
Greg decides that now is the time for excessive modesty.
GREG
I’m not that good of a friend.
MADISON
No, really. Greg. You’re being a
good friend to her.
GREG
No I’m really not.
MADISON
Are you serious right now? Greg.
She told me. That you’ve been a
great friend.
GREG
She was probably lying.
EARL
Greg. Hell’s wrong with you. Accept
a damn compliment.
DERRICK
Ma you want my number one time?

53.

Blue (6/3/14)

54-56.

MADISON
No thanks. Anyway, I tracked you
down because I had a huge
brainstorm and I thought - what if
you made a movie for Rachel?
Brief BLACKOUT with the words “NOW YOU ARE DEAD.”
GREG
That’s not a good idea.
MADISON
It’s an amazing idea. It would be
her favorite thing in the entire
world. Please just think about it?
Greg looks at Earl. Earl looks at Greg like, this is your
problem, and you need to deal with it.
Word.

GREG

Earl winces.
MADISON
Did you just say, “Word”?
GREG
Yeah, word, like, I agree.
MADISON
So you agree! To make a movie for
Rachel! AAAHHHHHH
She clutches his arm. MOOSE CHIPMUNK STOMPING.
MADISON (CONT’D)
(leaving)
Oh my God I can’t wait to see it. I
have to run. You guys are the best.

INT. HOSPITAL, LOUNGE - SECOND ROUND OF TREATMENT - EARLY 52
DECEMBER - DAY
GREG, holding the ENORMOUS COLLEGE DIRECTORY under one arm,
finds RACHEL in the hospital’s cheery modern lounge. She is
watching one of his movies on her laptop.
She pauses it as she approaches.
RACHEL
(happily)
“Droogle”?
GREG
Google for droogs. It’s stupid.
Greg is in a foul mood.
RACHEL
(indicating directory)
What’s that?
GREG
Oh, nothing. Just the bane of my
existence. Which my mom is forcing
me to carry around. Until I apply
to some colleges. She says it’s
like a menu for my future. Sure. A
menu that only has food that will
humiliate you for four years. So
it’s kind of a Mexican standoff, in
which I carry this thing around
forever, until my mom has irritated
me to death. Which will happen in,
tops, two days.
Beat.
RACHEL
You have to be less of an idiot
about college. Listen. Even if you
don’t think your classmates will
like you, which is literally an
insane thing to think, you’re way
less exposed to them in college.
High school is 40 hours of class a
week. College is 15-20.
And if you don’t want to live with
other kids, go to school around
here! Go to Pittsburgh State! Live
at home! Don’t get me wrong. I
think living at home would be
unnecessary and stupid. But it’s
better than sitting college out
just because you irrationally hate
yourself.

Blue (6/3/14)

58-59.

GREG
(cowed)
Not “irrationally,” though-RACHEL
Just apply to Pitt State right now.
Apply early.
(she nods at her computer)
Do it right now, in front of me.
Let’s get this out of the way.
GREG
What if I say no?
RACHEL
I’ve got stage four cancer.
(beat)
So that would be pretty dick.
UGGH FINE.

GREG

They sit down. He melodramatically takes her computer and
begins typing:
GREG (CONT’D)
“Why I want to go to college.”
(defiantly, to Rachel)
By Werner Herzog.
Rachel shrugs: bring it on.
GREG (CONT’D)
(Werner Herzog voice)
The highly selective admissions
process of college weeds out the
cruel and the stupid. And so a
college is quite different from the
senseless chaos and sickening
enormity of high school. High
school is the mouth of a great
demon, biting and chewing and
smushing people in the face. It is
simply overwhelming.
(dropping the Herzog
voice)
In seriousness, I am looking
forward to college because I never
fit in in high school. Because of
my weird rodent face Nope -

RACHEL

GREG
And habit of saying the dumbest
possible shit No!

RACHEL

GREG
The sheer pastiness of my
complexion overwhelms all who
behold it with existential nausea RACHEL
(overriding him)
“In high school, I never truly got
comfortable in my own skin. In
fact, I’ve always been someone who
doesn’t like himself very much. But
I think that just means I have some
growing up to do. And college is
the place where I’m going to do
it.”
GREG
(deeply uncomfortable)
That’s way too personal.
RACHEL
It’s a personal essay.
Beat.
GREG
Fine. But only because, cancer.
(briskly typing)
And, you have to do this too now.
Okay? Here. Page through this huge
horrible book. It’s yours now. Find
some colleges. Mmmmmmmmmm. It’s
like a menu for your future.

He is happier than he thought he’d be. But he has no one to
share it with - Rachel is asleep. So he does an awkward

The Worst Film Ever Made
GREG
...so if we make this film, people
will be like, oh, Greg and Earl,
they’re those weird filmmakers.
They’re always creepily filming
stuff. They probably sneak up to
your house at night and film you
while you’re asleep.
EARL
(chewing)
This is nasty as hell.
GREG
But people probably already think
that. Because you gave those stupid
films to Rachel. So basically I’ve
become completely conspicuous,
like, all the time. People look at
me, they think, filmmaker. When
they’re not already thinking,
cancer girl’s boyfriend.
EARL
(examining container)
The hell even is this. This taste
like a dog’s funky-ass butthole.

GREG’S DAD explains the boys’ mission to a GRIZZLED OLD
EMPLOYEE GREG’S DAD
They want fresh inspiration. I must
tell you, the richest inspiration I
have ever known was during my
period of quarantine in the Amazon,
where I and a half-dozen other
unfortunates had nothing to watch
but the bristling, leviathan
spiders bunched on the rotting,
flimsy thatch perhaps eight feet
above our faces. Spiders the size
of your fist.

GREG’S DAD (CONT'D)
Their fangs glistening with venom
and their thousandfold black eyes
shining dully in the gloom. And all
the night long they would battle
the wasps. In the darkness you
would hear a sudden anguished hiss
as a spider was struck by an adult
leopard wasp, and in their mortal
struggle they would plummet onto
one’s bed, biting and stinging and
thrashing and -

64-65A.

- as EARL and GREG split up and peruse the aisles of movies
with terrific intensity.
Greg slows down in a little zone of experimental filmmakers EAMES, FISCHINGER, BRAKHAGE, MAYSLESES, WARHOL.
INTERCUT his scrutiny of their DVD cases with SNIPPETS OF THE
ANIMATIONS THEMSELVES, as he replays each in his mind’s eye.
Clutching handfuls of these DVDs, he looks over at Earl. Earl
brandishes some GODZILLA KNOCK-OFFS. Greg shakes his head.
Earl nods, like, yeah, I know, but Godzilla is still the
fucking best.

INT. RACHEL’S LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

62

EARL is working the cameras while GREG, holding a notebook,
is attempting to interview DENISE, who is openly drinking.
(RACHEL is in the hospital for her fourth round of chemo.)
It’s not entirely clear that Denise knows that they’re making
a film, or cares.
GREG
So, Denise, can you tell us a
little about Rachel’s birth?
DENISE
Rachel’s birth. What an ordeal.
(beat)
Greg, listen to me. Listen. I’ve
been a good mother to her. Some
single moms, their kids have to
grow up too fast. But I’ve tried to
protect her from that. I have.
Uh, right.

GREG

DENISE
And now I’m learning, some things,
you can’t protect your kid from. No
matter what you do.
Denise sips from her glass of bourbon, her gunmetal eyes
reflecting some tiny part of the crushing horror of it.
GREG
So did she have a favorite toy?
DENISE
Promise me one thing. You’re gonna
grow up, become an adult. Promise
me you won’t have a baby unless
you’re ready to love that baby’s
mother, your whole life.
GREG
So, no favorite toy.
DENISE
“Toy”? Here’s a toy. Scissors. Bill
left and she rounded up all his
precious old books and cut em right
up. Don’t tell her I told you. I
was like, atta girl. Snip, snip,
snip. HA.
Denise starts pouring drinks for Greg and Earl.

Blue (6/3/14)

DENISE (CONT’D)
Have a little taste with me. You’re
old enough to have a little taste.

INT. AUDITORIUM - AFTER SCHOOL

64

The room is empty, save for GREG and EARL sitting in chairs
with clipboards and a STUDENT, sitting in a chair, facing a
camera on a tripod.
Greg is trying to mask how depressed and upset this is making
him. Earl physically cannot stop scowling.
GREG
...so just think of it like a getwell card, except it’s a video. And
start whenever you’re ready.
TESTIMONIAL STUDENT #1
(with glib, smiley
insincerity)
Uh. Hi, Rachel. I guess I don’t
know you that well, but uh... I
believe in you.
(beat)
You can do it!
That is all that this kid has to say.
EARL
(sullenly)
That’s real nice.

TESTIMONIAL STUDENT #2
It’s so sweet that your boyfriend
is doing this for you! He must
really love you.
(Greg says something
inaudible offscreen)
Oh.
TESTIMONIAL STUDENT #3
I know you’re Jewish, but I just
want you to know, God has a plan
for you.
TESTIMONIAL STUDENT #4
(can’t stop crying)
TESTIMONIAL STUDENT #5
Greg’s a fag. I guess he’s in love
with you, so that makes him
bisexual or something. I hope they
find a cure for whatever you have.
(to Greg, offscreen)
That’s all I got, fag.

GREG and EARL have just finished watching the footage.
EARL

Damn.

INT. RACHEL’S BEDROOM - DIRECTLY AFTER FOURTH ROUND OF
CHEMO - FEBRUARY - AFTERNOON
RACHEL sits stiffly on the bed. GREG sits next to her with
her barf bucket on his lap.
They’re watching a Gaines/Jackson film, but she’s not
enjoying it as much as she used to. So he’s not enjoying
this, either.

66

Green (06/20/2014)
GREG (V.O.)
So again, if this was a touching
romantic story, we’d obviously fall
in love, and she’d say all the wise
beautiful things that can only be
learned in life’s twilight or
whatever, and then she’d die in my
arms. But again: that’s not what
happened. She just got quieter, and
unhappier.

68A.

Blue (6/3/14)

69.

Greg finally can’t be quiet anymore-GREG
Hey. How are you feeling, for real.
RACHEL
For real? I’m feeling like you
might have been right.
GREG
Right when?
RACHEL
Back in October. When you thought I
was dying.
GREG
(gutted/trying to recover)
Oh. Well. I regret thinking that.
RACHEL
Don’t regret it.
This is so miserable that Greg actually has to make a joke.
GREG
Urrrnrrnnnngh.
(after no response)
Urrrnnnrnrnnnnnrnggggghggh.
RACHEL
What is that noise.
GREG
Regretful Polar Bear.
Against her will, Rachel snort-laughs a little bit.
GREG (CONT’D)
Polar bears have the purest
expressions of regret in the animal
kingdom. Listen to how haunting and
plaintive they sound. Urrrrnnrnngh.
RACHEL
Don’t make me laugh, though. It
kind of hurts.
GREG
(sadly)
All right.
A long beat.
GREG (CONT’D)
Kind of a monster silence in here.

Blue (6/3/14)

69A.

RACHEL
Yeah. It’s okay to just be silent
for a while.
Greg finds it difficult to be silent. He fidgets and squirms.
He starts making a humming noise.
GREG (V.O.)
Look. I know you’re really bracing
for this sweet girl, that you
probably like a lot, to die.

Blue (6/3/14)
GREG (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Just please bear with me. She
doesn’t. She gets better. I
promise.

INT. GREG’S BEDROOM - THE NEXT DAY

67

GREG and EARL are creating an ABSTRACT STOP-MOTION ANIMATION.
Earl is creating little CUT-OUTS from FELT OR CONSTRUCTION
PAPER. He is dissatisfied with each one.
Greg is arranging them painstakingly under a camera on a
tripod, consulting the complex sketches he has made to guide
this process.
68

STOP-MOTION ANIMATION - WEEKS GO BY
SUPERS over the frames of this animation: Day 86 of Doomed
Friendship, Day 87 of Doomed Friendship, Day 88 of Doomed
Friendship, etc. Each day is about a tenth of a second.
GREG (V.O.)
This is pretty much all I remember
from that winter. Entire months of
my life, where all I remember is
making a shape move around (ALT
TBD). And yeah, I’m aware of how
cosmically depressing that sounds.

EXT./INT. RACHEL’S HOUSE/BEDROOM - MULTIPLE DAYS/NIGHTS

71.
69

JUMPCUTS of GREG walking to Rachel’s house, entering her
room, leaving her room, leaving her house, waiting on her
doorstep as Denise’s car pulls up (back from the hospital).
GREG (V.O.)
I mean, obviously I remember
visiting Rachel too. What I don’t
remember is doing schoolwork. I’m
not exaggerating when I tell you
that I did literally zero
schoolwork during this time. I
mean, literally zero. That’s
actually sort of hard to do.
70

INT. RACHEL’S BEDROOM - AFTER 5TH CHEMO ROUND - APRIL - DAY70
RACHEL looks terrible. There’s no way to get around it.
RACHEL
So what’s going on at school.
GREG
The entire school looks like a
castle, because medieval prom is
about to happen. I guess everyone
is trying to figure out how to
twerk, like, medievally.
RACHEL
Are you going?
GREG
Of course not.
RACHEL
You should go.
GREG
No way. Have you seen me in a tux?
It’s like when they make a dog wear
human clothes. It just makes you
sad to look at it. Anyway, I don’t
have anyone to go with.
Greg realizes that he is talking to a girl.
GREG (CONT’D)
(with great effort)
I mean, uh... unless you... wanted
to, uh...
RACHEL
Greg, I’m not going to prom.

Blue (6/3/14)

72.

GREG
No, you totally could. It could be
this awesome statement, like-RACHEL
(cutting him off)
Hey. When are you gonna finish your
movie?
GREG
My movie? You know I’m not working
on a movie.
RACHEL
You don’t have to pretend. Earl’s
been telling me about it.
Somehow it hurts a lot, that this surprise has been ruined.
GREG
He... yes, I guess he probably did.
RACHEL
Sorry. I’m just asking because-GREG
Goddamn Earl. It was supposed to be
a surprise for you. It’s just taken
forever, because we really want to
get it right-RACHEL
I think I’m probably gonna stop
treatment pretty soon.
It is very quiet in the room for a moment.
What?

GREG

RACHEL
It just isn’t doing me any good.
All it’s doing is making me even
sicker.
GREG
Yeah, but if you stop...
He can’t finish this sentence.
RACHEL
We’ll just see what happens.
GREG
We know what’s gonna happen.

Blue (6/3/14)
Rachel studies him.
RACHEL
I know who you can take to prom.
Who?

GREG

RACHEL
This sexy pillow here.
GREG
Oh my God. Please don’t make jokes
right now. I can’t deal with that.
RACHEL
Oooh, Greg. This pillow’s name is
Francesca. She’s a filthy Italian
woman.
STOP IT.

GREG

It is the first time he’s ever shouted at her.
RACHEL
Don’t yell at me.
GREG
So you’re just gonna give up.
That’s it. To hell with college. To
hell with the future.
RACHEL
Greg, don’t-GREG
You’re just gonna give up and die.
What the hell is wrong with you?
It’s your life.
RACHEL
(spurred to anger)
Yes, it is my life. And it’s me
lying in bed all the time, with a
shaved head, and getting weaker and
uglier and more miserable, with no
hope in sight--I’m the one
suffering through this, not you. So
don’t yell at me.
They are trembling with anger at each other.

73.

Blue (6/3/14)
GREG
I’m sorry. I’m not going to get
comfortable with watching you die.
I’m just not. So don’t ask me to.
RACHEL
If you can’t accept that I’m going
to do what I want to do, with my
life, then you’re a terrible
friend.
GREG
I’m a terrible friend? I’m not
giving up. I’m not ruining my
friend’s life by giving up on the
whole world.
RACHEL
Please. Greg, you should be
overjoyed. Now you can go back to
your life of being invisible and
detached and self-hating.
GREG
Yeah and you can go back to your
life of being dead.
RACHEL
Nice. Really nice.
GREG
This is gonna kill your mom. So
you’ve gotten comfortable with
that? It doesn’t bother you
anymore, thinking about your mom?
RACHEL
Get out of here, Greg. You’ve done
your time. You don’t have to hang
out with the sick girl anymore.
GREG
How can you--how can you even say
that?
RACHEL
Your mom forced you to hang out
with me. Earl forced you to show me
your movies. Madison forced you to
make a movie for me. So yeah. What
part of any of that did you
actually want to do?
Greg opens his mouth--but he has no response to this.

74.

Blue (6/3/14)

75.

RACHEL (CONT’D)
Do something nice for me for once.
And get out.
71

EXT. SIDEWALK - DIRECTLY AFTERWARD

71

Greg is walking to Earl’s house, through Earl’s dilapidated
neighborhood. He is muttering furiously to himself. All of
his anger and frustration is now channeled at Earl.
Super: The part where I get in my first fight ever
GREG
Earl. EARL. This is it. You’ve gone
too far. You’ve leaked the
unleakable secret. Because you hold
nothing sacred. Because you’re a
dickhead.
A tough-looking kid watches Greg pass.
GREG (CONT’D)
The foundation of any good working
partnership is trust. I can no
longer trust you in any way.
He takes a clumsy tripping step on the broken pavement. He
begins to hyperventilate.
GREG (CONT’D)
You’ll leak anything to anyone.
It’s like working with Julian...
Assange.
Greg does not know how to pronounce “Assange.” This only
serves to infuriate him further.
GREG (CONT’D)
Ass-andge.
(beat)
Assangggeh.
(beat)
DAMMIT.
A72

EXT. EARL’S HOUSE - LATER
GREG thumbs Earl an angry text. EARL’S BROTHER DERRICK
saunters out onto the porch, with DOOPIE on a leash.
DERRICK
Hell you want.
GREG
I’m just waiting for Earl.

A72

Blue (6/3/14)

75A.

Derrick eyes Greg. So does Doopie, growling. Greg’s anger is
now vying with his fear.
It is a relief, but not really, when Earl appears.

Blue (6/3/14)

76.

EARL
Sup. You gonna come in?
GREG
No, I’m good.
Oh no.

DERRICK

Uh-oh.
EARL
The hell you want, bro.
GREG
Uh, I was just talking to Rachel,
and she, uh, told me you told her,
uh, about the uh, the film. We were
making. For her.
Yeah?

EARL

GREG
You’re like, uh, Julian Ass-andge.
EARL
The shit is that.
GREG
It’s just, you know, I mean, you
always do this, because you want to
be a better friend than me or
something. So you just tell Rachel
about everything, and it’s like, it
doesn’t even matter what I want.
EARL
You know what? Shut the hell up.
You need to shut the hell up right
about now. I’m tired of this, man.
I’m about to lose my shit with you.
Earl advances down the steps of his porch on an increasingly
trembly, weepy Greg.
GREG
(trying hard not to cry)
I just, I can’t trust you, and I
don’t know if I can work with, with
you again--

Blue (6/3/14)

77.

EARL
Naw. Shut the hell up. You care so
goddamn much bout what other people
think, gotta go round kissin
errybody’s ass pretendin like you
they friend, well lemme tell you:
nobody give a shit about you.
Nobody... give a shit.
DERRICK
Whoop his ass!
EARL
And now this one girl come along,
the only girl that do give a shit,
and you start whinin and bitchin
cuz I told her about the damn
films. Bitchin and complainin
because somebody cares about your
shit. DAMN.
DERRICK
BUST HIS CANDY ASS.
EARL
Goddamn I’m sick and tired a
watchin you treat this girl like a
burden. She is about to die. You
know that, right? That girl is
about to die. Meanwhile you come to
my house whinin and cryin bout some
irrelevant bullshit. Goddamn I want
to bust your ass. I want... to beat
the hell out of you right now.
Go for it.

GREG

EARL
You want me to?
GREG
I don’t care.
EARL
Bitch, you want me to?
GREG
Yeah, Earl, I want you tOOOONGH
Earl socks Greg in the stomach. Greg immediately keels over.
DERRICK
Yeah! JACK THAT LITTLE DUDE UP.

Blue (6/3/14)

78.

But Earl does not jack that little dude up. He storms back
inside his house, furious.
Wheezing and choking back sobs, Greg gets to his feet. He
looks at the house. Derrick gazes coolly back at him.
DERRICK (CONT’D)
I’da whooped the hell out of you.
72

INT. MCCARTHY’S OFFICE - THE NEXT DAY
GREG is sullenly eating alone. MR. MCCARTHY walks in to
refill his thermos.
MR. MCCARTHY
Beast. Where’s the other beast?
GREG
Earl? I don’t know. He’s not here.
Mr. McCarthy gamely tries again.
MR. MCCARTHY
What’s the status with the twentypager on Nixon?
GREG
I need another extension.
MR. MCCARTHY
It’s the end of the quarter, bud.
GREG
Well, I’ve been busy.
Mr. McCarthy observes Greg.
MR. MCCARTHY
(more quietly)
I heard the latest about Rachel.
(beat)
How are you holding up.
GREG
You know... not great.
MR. MCCARTHY
I was fifteen when my Dad died.
Couple years younger than you.
Greg is startled by this.

72

Blue (6/3/14)
MR. MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
You know what I remember about it?
My whole childhood I just thought
of him as this big, quiet, kind of
asshole guy. Didn’t laugh much.
Liked his sons to wear ties.
And then at the wake, all his old
buddies are there telling me about
him, and it’s like they’re talking
about a complete other guy. Like,
he knew every European pop song
from the 70s, from when he was
stationed in Germany. He’d just sit
around memorizing songs to sing at
German girls in bars. His go-to was
this Dutch song called Ding-A-Dong.
That’s a real song. And he sang it
at German girls in bars.
GREG
So what does that mean.
MR. MCCARTHY
It just means that, even if someone
dies, you’re still gonna keep
learning about them. You know?
Their life keeps unfolding to you,
if you keep paying attention to it.
GREG
(sullenly)
What, if you’re like a historian?
Are you seriously trying to make
this into some stupid sappy lesson?
Mr. McCarthy smiles at Greg and gets to his feet.
MR. MCCARTHY
You’re a good kid, Greg.
I’m not.

GREG

MR. MCCARTHY
You’re a good goddamn kid.
GREG
(gathering his stuff)
Look. I’m going home. I’m cutting
school right in front of you. I’m
not a good kid.
Mr. McCarthy says nothing.

79.

Blue (6/3/14)

80.

GREG (CONT’D)
(leaving)
I’m not.
A73

INT. CITY BUS - A FEW MINUTES LATER

A73

GREG is slumped in a seat, staring without seeing out of the
window, as the bus rumbles home.
73

INT. GREG’S KITCHEN - A HALF-HOUR LATER

73

On his way in, GREG passes his DAD, munching sausage.
GREG’S DAD
Earl came by earlier to drop
something off, but he turned down
this superb Andouille rabbit
sausage, which is quite unlike him is everything all right?
Greg does not respond.
74

INT. GREG’S BEDROOM

74

GREG finds a DVD on his desk. On it is scrawled, in Sharpie,
“IM OUT.”
He plays the DVD. It’s of EARL, talking to the camera, in
Greg’s room.
EARL
Hi Rachel. We tried a bunch of
different ways of making a film for
you, and all of em turned out
goofy, and irrelevant, and not like
we wanted. So now I’m just gonna
talk to you directly.
(collects himself)
I’ma be honest here. Sometimes
white girls are a particular kind
of stupid. I mean errbody stupid
but you know. White girls think
they smarter than errbody. Selfcentered and pretendin like they
ain’t - well, obviously you ain’t
been like that.
(collects himself again)
It’s just crazy how patient you
been. That’s all I wanted to say.
If it was me at had cancer, I’d be
angry as hell, and... and hurtful,
and just tryna beat errybody’s ass
half the time.
(MORE)

Blue (6/3/14)
EARL (CONT'D)
So I’m just amazed at how patient
you been. And you’ve made me feel,
uh, blessed.
(now pissed off; also a
little husky-voiced)
Greg, I ain’t workin on this no
more. Do whatever the hell you
want. I’m out.

80A.

Blue (6/3/14)

81.

Earl switches off the camera and the clip ends, leaving Greg
alone in his room.
Greg holds his head in his hands.
Then he flips on the camera. And tries to do a testimonial of
his own.
GREG
Hi Rachel. Uh... Earl’s right. All
the ways we tried to make a film
for you turned out completely
horrible. So, yeah. It got me
thinking about the reason I wanted
to do this film.
He pauses. The fact is, he never wanted to do this film.
GREG (CONT’D)
And that reason is, when you come
right down to it, and just say it,
simply, without screwing around:
He has to say something.
GREG (CONT’D)
Uh... I believe in you.
He is quoting the first video testimonial, from that stupid
kid. He’s not even saying his own meaningless clichéd thing.
It’s something else’s.
He can’t bring himself to look at the camera. He’s looking
down, at his hands.
GREG (CONT’D)
(finally, sadly)
You can do it.
He is silent. Then he shuts off the camera.
75

INT. MCCARTHY’S OFFICE - THE NEXT DAY
GREG opens the door to Mr. McCarthy’s office. EARL is in
there, eating one of his all-candy lunches. On a screen
behind him plays MY BEST FIEND, KLAUS KINSKI.
GREG
Oh. Are you eating lunch in here
still?
EARL
Not if you are.

75

Blue (6/3/14)

82.

GREG
Well, I’m not eating in here if you
are.
EARL
Well, good. Cuz I like it in here.
GREG
So I guess I’ll just go. Or, you
could go.
EARL
Nope. I like the air-conditioning,
and I like the comfortable chairs.
GREG
Yeah, I like those too.
EARL
Well, that’s your damn problem.
76

INT. CAFETERIA - SHORTLY AFTERWARDS

76

GREG trudges sadly through his personal hell: the cafeteria.
One flying bit of food hits his face, then another.
He finds a place to sit alone. Over his head, a banner reads:
SCHENLEY SENIOR PROM “2013” A “KNIGHT” TO “REMEMBER” !!!
77

INT. CAFETERIA - DAYS PASS
He eats alone in the same seat, day after day, forlorn and
withdrawn.
He is checking his email on his phone, despondently (we can’t read the body, but it’s from Pittsburgh State
University)
- when someone sits down in front of him.
It is MADISON.
Arm touch/MOOSE SMUSHES CHIPMUNK WITH HOOVES.
MADISON
Greg. I need to talk to you about
the movie.
GREG
It’s not done yet.

77

Blue (6/3/14)
MADISON
Greg. You’ve been working on this
movie for like four months.
GREG
Yeah, we tried a bunch of things.
They just aren’t very good.

82A.

Blue (6/3/14)

83.

MADISON
UGH. Greg. Now is not the time for
your whole, I’m-Greg, I-suck,
nothing-I-do-is-any-good thing. I’m
sure what you have is awesome and
Greg I really think it can make a
difference if you just put it
together and give it to her.
GREG
(bitterly)
Madison, she’s stopped treatment.
She gave up. She quit.
Madison gazes at him. Her eyes glisten.
MADISON
(icily)
So maybe that’s a good reason to
finish the stupid movie. And give
it to her.
(more so)
But you know what? Whatever.
She stalks away.
78

INT. GREG’S BEDROOM - THAT AFTERNOON

78

GREG is watching his testimonial to Rachel. He watches
himself mumble, “I believe in you.” Pathetic. He rewinds it
and plays it again. “You can do it.” Excruciating.
His MOM enters the room.
Honey?
What.

GREG’S MOM
GREG

He looks up. His mother looks stricken.
GREG’S MOM
Honey, Rachel’s back in the
hospital.
GREG
Wait--is she starting treatment
again?

Blue (6/3/14)
GREG’S MOM
It’s not for treatment, honey.
Oh.

GREG

His mom waits for him to say something.
Mom, what.

GREG (CONT’D)

GREG’S MOM
I just thought we could go-GREG
You just figured this was your last
chance to force me to hang out with
her?
GREG’S MOM
Greg, come on-GREG
Don’t worry, mom. I’m sure you can
find some other girl with cancer
after Rachel dies. Which, by the
way, she’s decided to do. She’s
decided to die. So maybe I can
decide not to visit her.
GREG’S MOM
I promise you will regret it if you
don’t visit her. You will regret it
for the rest of your life.
GREG
(exploding)
Yeah. That’s probably true. But you
know what? I have a shitload of
things to regret. I regret not
having a date for tomorrow’s stupid
prom. I regret being too weird to
make friends. I definitely regret
making those shitty films with
Earl. And I assume you saw the
email I got today from Pitt State,
when you were going through my
stuff - no? You didn’t? Oh! Have a
look!
He opens an email on his phone and tosses it to his mom.
GREG (CONT’D)
I’m probably gonna regret doing
literally no schoolwork this year!

84.

Blue (6/3/14)

85.

GREG’S MOM
(in shock)
Oh my God, Greg-GREG
I know! Admission rescinded! Due to
“significant change in my academic
record”! Oh well! No college! I
guess I’ll just be home next year!
I know, it sucks. It’ll be way
harder for you to go through my
stuff.
His mom, horrified, says nothing.
GREG (CONT’D)
But for right now, do me a favor.
And just leave me alone. I just
want to sit here and regret stuff.
I’m gonna think of everything I’ve
ever done, and everything I haven’t
done, and just regret the living
shit out of it.

EXT./INT. GREG’S BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT
GREG is watching his animation and his sock puppets and
listening to HIS PARENTS argue through the walls.
GREG’S MOM (O.S.)
(tearfully)
The deadlines have passed, Victor!
What’s he going to do next year? Is
he just going to waste his year?
GREG’S DAD (O.S.)
He is grieving, honey. You have to
let him grieve.
GREG’S MOM (O.S.)
How can you tell me to just do
nothing while he ruins his life?
GREG’S DAD (O.S.)
That’s not what I’m saying.
The conversation continues as Greg watches his video.
SOCK PUPPET RACHEL
I BEAT THE SHIT OUT OF CANCER
BECAUSE I DON’T GIVE A SHIT

EXT. SCHENLEY/INT. CAFETERIA - THE NEXT DAY

85A.
80

Once again, GREG is eating alone under the prom banner, which
now has the word “TONIGHT !!!!!” added to it. And maybe even
more gratuitous quotation marks.

Blue (6/3/14)
And again, Madison comes to sit with him.
Super: The part where I get in my second fight ever
MADISON
(hesitantly)
Greg? Can I ask you something?
Greg gathers his things and gets up.
Nope.

GREG

MADISON
It’s not what you think-ALT: It’s not what you think. It’s
about prom-Madison touches his arm, but he shrugs it off, angrily-GREG
(interrupting)
Let me ask you something--what is
this? What is up with the armtouching?
Greg is backing away from her now. She is following.
GREG (CONT’D)
Are you just being friendly? Or is
it, like, this calculated tactic?
To get me to do whatever you want?
Because you have to understand what
it does, when a beautiful, sexy,
otherwise thoughtful girl touches
the arm of a scrawny pasty guy with
a groundhog face. It’s an act of
cruelty.
MADISON
Are you done?
GREG
Yeah, I’m done with you. And I’m
done with the stupid film.
He backs into ILL PHIL.
ILL PHIL
But you ain’t done with me.
GREG
Oh come on.

86.

Blue (6/3/14)
ILL PHIL
You’ll never escape me. Nobody rats
me out and lives to tell about it.
(MORE)

86A.

Blue (6/3/14)
ILL PHIL (CONT'D)
I’m back for my revenge /
Stab you in the dick, pardon my
French /
Shove your body under a bench /

87.

GREG
(frantic)
Are you honestly gonna stab me?
Fine. Go for it. You’re gonna go to
jail for your entire life, but,
it’s probably worth it. Stab away.
Ill Phil is not prepared for this. He was hoping Greg’s
reaction would be more along the lines of running away.
ILL PHIL
You lucky I ain’t got my knives.
Stead you gotta fight me, punk.
GREG
Sure. I’ll fight you. Just no
rapping.
They square up. Onlookers excitedly gather, including a
grimly snickering SCOTT MAYHEW.
Neither Greg nor Phil makes a move for a long time.
They actually have no idea how to fight.
ILL PHIL
(muttering rap)
Break your eyeball with a
fist I got clenched /
Take your teeth out with a
wrench /
Hit you with a stone from
Stonehenge /

GREG (CONT'D)
Stop.
Seriously stop.
I can’t do this if you’re
gonna rap the whole time.

Finally Ill Phil swings and Greg grabs his arm. But then Greg
doesn’t know what to do with it.
ILL PHIL (CONT’D)
(thrashing a little)
Leggo my arm.
GREG
Okay. Jesus.
SCOTT MAYHEW
Phil! Remember how he has trampled
our dignity!
More circling. The onlookers are becoming restless. Finally
Greg rushes Ill Phil and grabs him around the waist. Ill Phil
panics and grabs Greg around his waist.

Blue (6/3/14)

88.

They stay like that for a while.
And then, suddenly, EARL flies in and starts whooping ILL
PHIL’S ass.
The CROWD goes berserk.
Almost immediately, the PRINCIPAL separates the fight.
PRINCIPAL
BREAK IT UP.
81

INT. SCHENLEY HALLWAY

81

The PRINCIPAL and a SECURITY GUARD are leading/dragging EARL,
GREG, and ILL PHIL to the nearest school exit.
GREG
(to Earl)
I thought you were eating lunch in
Mr. McCarthy’s office.
EARL
He all sad. Talkin bout German
music or something. I was like,
dude. This is boring as hell.
82

EXT. FRONT OF SCHOOL

82

The PRINCIPAL, SECURITY GUARD, GREG, EARL, and ILL PHIL
emerge from the doors.
PRINCIPAL
(to Greg and Earl)
Two days’ suspension for fighting.
Two days’ suspension for fighting.
(to Ill Phil)
Two days’ suspension for fighting
to be added to your lifetime
suspension for drug dealing. Please
leave school property.
BOYS
Yes sir/Awright.
As they begin walking away, MADISON approaches them.
Greg.
What.

MADISON
GREG

Blue (6/3/14)

89.

MADISON
Come to prom with me.
Even Earl does not know what to say here.
MADISON (CONT’D)
Look. You were right. This whole
movie situation has been really
difficult for you, and I feel like
it’s my fault. I want a chance to
make things up to you a little bit.
ILL PHIL
Yo, you can make things up to me.
(beat)
You want my number?
EARL
(to Ill Phil)
Ain’t nobody want your beat-ass
number. You are going to die alone.
GREG
So this is a pity date?
MADISON
It’s not a pity date.
She smiles.
MADISON (CONT’D)
I think we’d have fun.
83

INT. GREG’S BEDROOM - THAT EVENING

83

GREG is putting on his tuxedo. He is having some trouble with
the arms.
His MOM is standing by the door.
GREG’S MOM
I told you you would get a date.
Yup.

GREG

GREG’S MOM
So, you’re welcome. For the tuxedo
and everything.
GREG
Thanks Mom.

Green (06/20/2014)

90.

GREG’S MOM
I am very unhappy about this
college thing. But your father and
I can wait until you’re ready to
talk about it.
GREG
I appreciate that.
GREG’S MOM
Let me help with your corsage.
She does.
Greg examines himself in the mirror.
GREG’S MOM (CONT’D)
My handsome boy, going to prom.
Take lots of pictures, okay?
Greg does not answer. He’s busy looking into the mirror. An
anxious boy in a tuxedo stares back out at him.
84

EXT. IN FRONT OF GREG’S HOUSE - EVENING

84

GREG, holding corsage, walks stiffly into a limousine.
85

INT. LIMOUSINE

85

GREG is alone in the back of a cavernous limousine. He has to
shout to reach his cheerful DRIVER.

*

GREG
302 Halket Street.
LIMO DRIVER
You got it, boss.

*

They drive.
LIMO DRIVER (CONT’D)
You love this girl?
GREG
Uh. I dunno if I would go that far.
LIMO DRIVER
Are you kids gonna get busy on my
brand-new Tuscan leather?
GREG
I think the odds are against that.

*
*

Green (06/20/2014)

91.

LIMO DRIVER
Ha. I’m just playing with you, man.
I hope you do get some.

*
*

GREG
Thanks. It’s really gonna depend on
what she wants to do.

*

LIMO DRIVER
Well. If you really love her, you
got a shot. Because she’ll know.

*
*

Greg does not respond to this.
LIMO DRIVER (CONT’D)
She is fine, though?

*

GREG
I wouldn’t say that.
86

EXT. SIDEWALK - FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER

86

GREG exits the limo, holding his corsage.
He is not in front of Madison’s house. He is front of the
HOSPITAL.
He takes a deep breath.
87

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MAY - EVENING

87

RACHEL is suffering from pneumonia, a complication of endstage AML. She is extremely pale and having difficulty
focussing. But she smiles when GREG walks in.
SUPER: Day 209 of Doomed Friendship
DENISE, sitting next to her, smiles with wet eyes, gets up,
and hugs Greg for a very long time. Then she leaves the room.
Hey.
Hey.

GREG
RACHEL

Her voice is weak and whispery.
GREG
I know. I look amazing. Here, let
me put flowers on you.
Thanks.

RACHEL

Blue (6/3/14)

92.

He puts the corsage on her wrist. It is not romantic. It is
something else.
He extracts his phone and a little projector from his pocket
and starts setting them up GREG
Before we watch this, uh... I’m
really sorry it took so long to
make. But the reason for that is,
we couldn’t figure out how to not
get it to suck. And we never did
figure it out. It still sucks, and
it’s not actually what I wanted to
say to you. But let’s just watch it
first. Okay?
She nods.
He turns on the projector. It projects onto the curtain. He
sits next to her, and they watch for a while.
The film does, as advertised, suck.
First, there are the TESTIMONIALS: students sitting in a
classroom, saying clichéd things, or unhelpful things. So
those suck.
DENISE’S INTERVIEW has been jarringly edited so as not to be
depressing, but of course this makes it even more depressing.
It goes without saying that this sucks.
And spliced among all of these sections is a mysterious
ANIMATION that is never explained and never gets enough time
to develop. It’s confusing. How could that not suck?
As they watch, Rachel begins to cough, weakly. Greg ignores
this for a few coughs.
Then he realizes that it isn’t going away.
GREG (CONT’D)
Should I get a nurse?
Rachel, nods, coughing, in pain.
88

INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY

88

SLIGHTLY SLOWED DOWN, SOUND MUFFLED
GREG emerges from the room. DENISE is asleep in a chair
outside. He jogs her arm. She wakes up, reads his face, and
rushes into the room, stricken.

Blue (6/3/14)

93.

GREG (V.O.)
That was the last time I saw
Rachel. She went into a coma
shortly after that, and died about
ten hours later.
Greg flags down a passing NURSE and says something to her.
Irritably, she walks into Rachel’s room, shutting the door
behind her.
GREG (V.O.)
Yeah. I know I told you she didn’t
die. But I mean... this is a story
about a girl with cancer.
Greg is left alone in a hospital hallway.
GREG (V.O.)
What did you think was going to
happen?
89

INT. HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - THE NEXT DAY

89

GREG, EARL, and MR. MCCARTHY are sitting all in a row, near
the back. The forceful inner-city PRINCIPAL is speaking.
PRINCIPAL
It is indeed a difficult time...
for the Schenley High School
family. We are mourning... a family
member. But we have an unexpected
and touching opportunity... to turn
our thoughts to her... in a unique
way.
(with God’s own voice)
EARL JACKSON. GREGORY GAINES.
Please come to the stage.
Greg’s heart skips a beat. His eyes widen with terror.
90

INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - FLASHBACK, LAST NIGHT

90

From the hall, through the half-open door, DENISE watches the
film projected on Rachel’s curtain.
PRINCIPAL (V.O.)
These boys made a film... that they
delivered to Rachel last night.

Blue (6/3/14)
91

INT. HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM

94.

BACK TO THE PRESENT:
Earl has his head deep in his hands.
92

INT. TEACHER’S CONFERENCE ROOM - FLASHBACK, EARLIER THAT DAY
92
TEACHERS and the PRINCIPAL watch the film on a computer. They
are very moved. They are watching a sock puppet part.
PRINCIPAL (V.O.)
And her mother has given us
permission... to show you this film
now.

93

BACK TO THE PRESENT:

93

Greg and Earl are up on stage. Cataclysm. It is, literally,
the stuff of nightmares.
PRINCIPAL
Before we show the film... Is there
anything you would like to say...
to the Schenley High School family.
Earl walks to the lectern. The mic is nowhere near his head.
The PRINCIPAL, noting this, removes the microphone and holds
it to Earl’s mouth.
Naw.

EARL

PRINCIPAL
You will let this audacious film
speak for you. Very good. Gregory?
Greg staggers to his feet. He takes the mic. He gazes out at
his classmates.
He has nothing to say to them. But he can’t just say nothing.
Suddenly he begins speaking.
GREG
This film sucks. And after you
watch it, you’re gonna think I’m
this pathetic untalented loser. But
here’s the thing: I don’t care what
you think about me. I’ve spent the
last four years obsessing over how
everyone sees me, and I just
realized, I don’t care anymore.
(MORE)

Blue (6/3/14)
GREG (CONT'D)
The only person whose opinion I
care about is dead. So, whatever.

95.

He puts the mic down, then decides to pick it back up.
GREG (CONT’D)
I’ve always wanted never to be
noticed by anyone. But the best way
not to be noticed is to be dead.
And I don’t want to be dead.
He puts the mic back. The principal, frowning, walks over to
reclaim the mic.
Then Greg abruptly grabs it a third time.
GREG (CONT’D)
Wait. Here’s why our film sucks.
It’s not the film we should have
made. Okay? Because I wasn’t even
friends with Rachel before she got
sick. And then she got sick and we
spent all this time together, but
it wasn’t enough. It just wasn’t.
To make the film we should have
made, we should have gotten her to
tell us every single thought she
has ever had. Because it’s all just
lost, now. We should have had a
camera on her, constantly, since
the day she was born. Because her
whole life, now, it’s just lost. We
should have had a camera inside her
head, because all of her specific
thoughts and ideas and hopes and
phobias and all of her impressions
of the whole stupid world, they’re
all about to be lost, and the film
we should have made would keep her
from being lost.
And I know that happens to
everyone. It’ll happen to everyone
in this room. And it’ll happen to
me. But I don’t care. All that I
can think about is that it happened
to her. And it happened last night.
And I can’t deal with it, I’ll
never be able to deal with it, and
this film has nothing to do with
that. Nothing.
(forcing back tears--semiincoherent)
It sucks. Nothing sucks more than
this. It sucks.

Blue (6/3/14)

96.

He puts down the mic and walks, then runs, offstage and out
of the auditorium. The students are baffled. Some of them are
giggling, but from nervousness.
Earl has his head in his hands.
The lights go down.
94

INT. RACHEL’S LIVING ROOM - AFTERWARD

95

MOURNERS wander around Denise’s house, sitting shiva.
GREG spots MADISON and SCOTT MAYHEW together holding hands,
talking to DENISE. Surprised and sickened, he avoids them.
He gazes, from afar, at the URN on the mantel that contains
Rachel’s ashes. He cannot stop looking at it. It is absurd to
him, in a way.
Suddenly he has been cornered by an OLD PERSON ELDERLY MOURNER
I heard you made a very nice little
movie about Rachel’s life.
GREG
Oh. Uh, yeah.
ELDERLY MOURNER
When will it be in theaters?

Blue (6/3/14)

97.

Greg does not have the heart to set this doddering old person
straight.
GREG
Soon. Really soon. I’m sure Denise
will let you know. Can you excuse
me for a moment?
Greg sneaks into the kitchen. He looks around for a place
where he can escape all human contact.
He gazes out the window, to the backyard, and sees someone.
96

EXT. RACHEL’S BACKYARD - A FEW MINUTES LATER

96

EARL has spent most of the shiva outside smoking irritably.
GREG approaches him.
EARL
Look who it is.
GREG
Sorry, I haven’t been out of my
room for a few days.
EARL
Yeah. I know. You smell terrible.
GREG
I can’t really smell myself.
EARL
(matter-of-factly)
You smell like a homeless dude. And
I heard even Pitt State ain’t takin
you no more.
GREG
Yeah, well. Whatever.
The backyard door opens. DENISE.
Hi boys.
EARL
Mrs. Kushner.

DENISE
GREG
Mrs. Kushner. I mean, Denise.

Denise is holding Greg’s COLLEGE DIRECTORY.

Blue (6/3/14)

98.

DENISE
Greg, I’m supposed to give this
back to you.
She does. And retreats back to the doorway.
DENISE (CONT’D)
(smiling sadly)
Squeak squeak.
(agreeing)
Squeak.

GREG

EARL
(begrudgingly)
Squeak.

Denise enters the house. Greg holds the college directory,
doing nothing.
A couple of envelopes fall out. He opens one.
RACHEL (V.O.)
Dear Greg. I heard what happened
with your classwork, and with Pitt
State. So I wrote them a letter
trying to convince them to let you
back in. There’s a copy in here if
you want to read it. Hopefully it
works, because that would mean I
have powers from beyond the grave.
But you should probably send them
something too.
Goodbye, Greg. You’re a good
friend. Although if you don’t go to
college, you’re also an idiot. But
you already knew that. Love,
Rachel.
At “goodbye,” Greg’s eyes blink and go wet.
He unfolds the second letter-RACHEL (V.O.)
Dear Pittsburgh State Admissions,
I am writing on behalf of someone
so kind and sweet and giving that
he -

Blue (6/3/14)

99.

He closes it. He can’t read another word. He closes his eyes.
Earl clears his throat.
EARL
I know it’s a bad time. But I ain’t
doin them films with you no more.
Greg throws up his arms, like, Jesus Christ. Like it’s not
already gut-wrenching enough out here.
EARL (CONT’D)
I ain’t. I can’t. I’m done.
Why?

GREG

EARL
I’ma level with you. I never even
liked makin the damn films. I like
watchin crazy-ass films. But I
hated makin em.
GREG
Earl, you’re the talented one.
You’re the one who’s supposed to do
this with his life.
EARL
Oh hell no. That’s you. That ain’t
me. I ain’t gonna be a broke-ass
artist.
(beat)
Me, I want to end up like your dad.
GREG
(momentarily shocked out
of misery)
What?!
Greg peers through the window at his DAD, who is alone in the
middle of the living room, scratching himself.
EARL
Listen, son. I’m just tellin you.
Your dad’s around. He around all
the damn time. Fact he around too
much. Talkin to the cat, starin
into space. But to hell with it.
That’s gonna be me. Serve my kids
funky-ass food, show em films with
subtitles. Wear random ethnic shit.
(MORE)

Blue (6/3/14)
EARL (CONT'D)
And I ain’t getting there by
spendin all my time makin films.
That is not a foundation for a
comfortable life. I need a career.
(not wanting to say this)
I’m goin to Duquesne. Pre-law.
Don’t tell nobody.

100.

GREG
Oh. ...Earl I had no idea th-EARL
(needing to move on)
Don’t be tellin nobody. Now, you.
You too weird to start a family. So
you can go ahead and do your brokeass artist thing. That’s fine. Run
out of money. You can come live in
my garage, with the raccoons.
Me, I’m makin a comfortable life.
No more films. I’m out.
Silence.
Earl notices GREG’S MOM watching them through the window.
She hesitates. But she can’t help herself. She gestures to
“smoking” to Earl, then gestures “death,” then gives him a
look of reproach.
Earl shrugs, baffled.
She sticks her head out of the window GREG’S MOM
(whispering)
Earl, it’s a little inappropriate
to be smoking a cigarette outside
of shiva. Of someone who had
cancer.
Oh. Earl philosophically stubs out his cigarette.
EARL
Sorry Mrs. Gaines.
She closes the window GREG
I’m out too. I’m not making films
anymore either. I’m retired.
EARL
No, you’re not.

Blue (6/3/14)
This next thing is hard to say.
GREG
Earl. If you quit, I have to quit.
Earl looks Greg in the eye.
Greg means it.
EARL
Listen. From now on, I’ma be your
audience. And I’ma watch everything
you make. Even if it’s terrible.
(MORE)

100A.

Blue (6/3/14)
EARL (CONT'D)
And it probly will be. You probly
ain’t shit without me. But that’s
what friends do. They gotta watch.
Even when they hate that shit.

101.

Yeah. I called you my friend. I’m
your friend. Deal with it.
Greg is beginning to cry again. Earl eyes him doubtfully.
EARL (CONT’D)
And you quit, I’ma beat the hell
out of you. All right?
All right.

GREG

EARL
I done it before. I’ll do it again.
It’s easy as hell. Because you
don’t know how to fight.
All right.

GREG

EARL
Goddammit stop cryin.
GREG
I’m not c-crying.
EARL
Cryin like a bitch.
Earl, after a resentful pause, puts his arm around Greg. He
pats Greg on the shoulder a few times.
EARL (CONT’D)
(irritably)
Feel like we’re having a goddamn
breakup right now. C’mon. Let’s go
inside.
Earl goes into the house. Greg just watches him quickly
become engulfed by the adults in there.
He looks over at the FIRE ESCAPE leading to Rachel’s bedroom
window.
97

INT. RACHEL’S BEDROOM
GREG steps through the window and into Rachel’s room, the
book under his arm, the letters in his hand.
He sits on her bed. Surrounded by pillows.

97

Blue (6/3/14)
He takes another look at the letter to him.
RACHEL
P.S. I’d also like for you to take
some of my pillows. They’ll want a
good home where they’ll be loved.
Greg picks up Francesca.
RACHEL (V.O.)
P.P.S. Not in the way you’re
thinking. That’s disgusting.
He gazes at the walls. Daniel Craig, Hugh Jackman.

101A.

Blue (6/3/14)

102.

He looks down at his directory. He opens it The inside has been CARVED OUT, intricately, into a little
landscape.
He is motionless, gazing at it. It is beautiful and strange.
There are three small figures in it. Somehow we know they are
Rachel, Greg, and Earl. Rachel’s has pink hair.
He runs a finger over the lip of this little fantastical
place that her hands made.
He gazes at her bookshelf. He pulls out a book - no carving
in there - another one - again no carving - another This one is carved out too. A different landscape. Two
figures - Rachel (the same color, but her old brown hair) and
one who is probably her mom.
He finds more and more. A world of landscapes. Different
styles, from different times in her life. Sometimes he knows
who the figures are, and sometimes he doesn’t. The figure
that is her is always recognizable.
There is no broad narrative connecting them. They are just
scenes. Not necessarily from her life - perhaps something
tangent to it.
At some point we are no longer seeing the book carvings - we
are just watching his face, as he SEES in a way that he never
has before.
A98

EXT. MURRAY HILL SIDEWALK - AFTERNOON

A98

Greg walks home slowly, eyes fixed on something unseeable,
somehow released, Rachel’s house behind him.

INT. GREG’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
We’re back to where we started: GREG staring at a computer
monitor, breathing loudly through his nose.

Blue (6/3/14)

103.

GREG (V.O.)
I know I might seem to you like I
hate myself and everything I do.
But really, I just hate everyone
I’ve ever been. The person I am
right now is okay.
Rachel’s ashes were scattered in a
park behind her house. Apparently
she ran away from home once and
tried to live there.
It was this story her aunt told at
the funeral. She was trying to
become a squirrel. She thought she
could turn into one by just being
in the forest and wanting it really
bad.
I guess maybe that’s what Mr.
McCarthy meant, about someone’s
life continuing to unfold.
It was weird to be learning
something new about Rachel after
she died. But somehow it was
reassuring as well.
The printer has just stopped printing the story we have just
been told. On the back we see the words, “Somehow it was
reassuring as well. FIN.”
He puts it in an envelope addressed to Pittsburgh State
University - Department of Admissions.
And then he puts a DVD in a jewel case. And then he sticks a
Post-It on top of the case, and writes, “WARNING: THE LAST
PERSON WHO SAW THIS IMMEDIATELY WENT INTO A COMA AND DIED.”
And he puts that in the envelope as well.
He seals the envelope.
He stares directly at us. We look into his eyes.
He crosses them, briefly.

BLACKOUT.

NOW YOU ARE DEAD
