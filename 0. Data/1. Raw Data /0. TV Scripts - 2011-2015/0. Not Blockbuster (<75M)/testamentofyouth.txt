CLOSE ON The face of VERA (24); her expression is watchful,
uncertain. Around her, the muffled, distorted sounds of
street celebrations. She has striking features, expressive
of great intelligence, yet tired by experiences beyond her
years.
Suddenly, SOUND comes CRASHING IN - Vera is on a London street thronging with merrymakers. A
swell of revellers push past, sweeping her away with them.
A caption: London, 11th November 1918.

EXT. LONDON STREET - EVENING (WINTER)

1

In the enfolding gloom of evening, Vera is BUFFETED in the
crowd; people wave flags, swig from bottles, sit astride
each other’s shoulders.
Vera mingles in the crowd but seems isolated, as though in
a separate bubble. The sound cuts in and out, as though
she’s having trouble connecting.
2

EXT. LONDON STREET - EVENING

2

Vera is moving through the throng, having to elbow her way,
overwhelmed by the densely packed bodies The noise still CUTS in and out - as a sudden loud ROAR
crashes in on her She gasps, turns - to see a MOTOR CAR, spilling over with
revellers. A WOMAN sits on top swigging from a champagne
bottle. A YOUNG SOLDIER, his head bandaged, sees Vera, and
leaps out.
He grabs her hands, pulling her into a hectic dance, as
others around them dance too. Vera SPINS!...dizzy, as faces
fly past her She’s trapped, the panic rises - she BREAKS FREE - Pushes through the crowd, desperate to escape, elbowing,
annoying people She sees some church steps ahead of her, and stumbles up
them.

INT. CHURCH - MOMENTS LATER
Vera hurries inside, her footsteps echoing on marble. Above
her, a high-vaulted dome, ahead of her, rows of pews. It’s
another world in here, silent, dark, seemingly empty.

Vera walks down a side aisle, and sees a rich oil painting
looming - Francis Danby’s “The Deluge”. Dark waves tower
menacingly in a STORM-RIPPED SEA, people are tossed around in
it like flotsam Helpless Vera is pulled in, mesmerised, towards the image of
apocalyptic destruction And SUDDENLY CUT TO:

SHE’S UNDERWATER -

in a murky gloom, struggling against the water’s force,
trapped, DROWNING! Her hands claw at the fabric of her heavy
Edwardian skirts CUT BACK TO:
5

INT. CHURCH -

5

Shapes take form around her in the gloom - figures, kneeling
in prayer in the pews, women all of them, some on their
knees, others staring into space As the air fills with their whispers VERA takes in the sight, her eyes flickering with panic, the
whispering sound magnifying in her mind We CUT back and forth between this and VERA DROWNING - And she realises the church is full of them - woman after
woman after woman, like an ocean of grief separated from the
world outside - as WE CUT BACK TO:
6

VERA IN THE WATER Floating now, not struggling, as though she’s given up She starts to sink, folding in on herself, but with a last
effort pushes up, and starts to slowly FLOAT UPWARDS - towards the surface She BREAKS through the water -

EXT. LAKE, BUXTON - DAY, 1914 (SPRING)

7

Vera surfaces in a beautiful lake, shimmering in a spring
heatwave. It’s five years earlier, and another world.
She’s younger, fresher. Her face clear of the experiences
that have so marked her.
Vera swims, keeping herself concealed behind lakeside
greenery, spying on two YOUNG MEN getting undressed on the
lake side - her brother EDWARD - 18, private, artistic,
elegant - and his close school friend VICTOR - kind, softnatured.
EDWARD
We used to swim here when we were
children...
She catches Edward’s eye, ducks out of sight. He smiles to
himself.
EDWARD (CONT’D)
Where is Vera? I hope she hasn’t
gone in yet, I completely forgot
about the rats VICTOR
(disgusted)
Rats?!
EDWARD
A big nest of them apparently,
we’ll be alright in the shallows,
but we definitely shouldn’t go over
there He gestures to the water - where Vera swims out, happily
smiling.
EDWARD
Oh no! Vera!
On VICTOR, down to shirt and trunks - his alarm!
VICTOR
Get out of the water! RATS!
Vera waves serenely back, seemingly unable to hear.
VERA
Come on in!
Victor RUNS down the pier, DIVES in and swims towards her.
He surfaces to see her grinning face. He turns, to see Edward
now fully undressed, who grins at him and dives in.

Victor realises he’s been had.
BASTARD!

VICTOR

He SWIMS back towards Edward - who feigns panic.
EDWARD
Oh no! Help! They’ve got me!
Victor DUCKS him - Vera watches, laughing.

Vera is finishing getting dressed behind a towel held up by
Edward. Victor can be seen further away, hurriedly pulling on
his trousers.

EDWARD
So what about you and Victor?
VERA
What about us?
EDWARD
Come on....
VERA
(non-committal)
He’s sweet.
EDWARD
Sweet! All the attention’s making
you arrogant!
He sees she’s finished, flicks her with the towel, they play
fight, as a shivering Victor comes over, holding his shoes.
VICTOR
I’m a block of ice!

*

Vera smiles, hands the towel to him, holding it out like a
cover for his bare torso. He takes it, grinning, and dries
off.

Edward, finishing getting dressed, checks his watch.

*

EDWARD
Come on, we should be getting back.

VERA
(disappointed)
Do we have to?

EDWARD
Mother and father are expecting us.
Victor pointedly takes Edward’s jacket and puts it on. Edward
smiles.
VERA
(playful)
They’re always expecting us!
They’re driving me mad!

*
*
*

VICTOR
I like your parents.
VERA
That’s because you don’t have to
live with them.
EDWARD
And Roland’ll be here soon.
VERA
(sighing)
Oh yes, how could I forget...the
perfect one.

*

The two boys smile, as they gather their things together.
VICTOR
He is good at everything.
VERA
Including being modest, I hope?
Of course.

EDWARD

VERA
Brilliant and modest, I hate him
already!
They start to walk away.
EDWARD
(light)
Give him a chance, Vera, alright? I
mean it!
As they enter the trees Vera lingers behind.
She pauses, turns back to the lake for a moment Breathes it in one last time -

the swaying rustle of the leaves - the tranquil, mysterious
beauty of the place - she smiles, loving it 8A

EXT. COUNTRYSIDE, DERBYSHIRE - MINUTES LATER

Vera, Edward and Victor walk home across a beautiful stretch
of countryside.

EXT. MELROSE - MINUTES LATER

The three of them walk towards the front garden of MELROSE,
the family house, a grand, grey Victorian building. Vera
suddenly remembers her wet hair, and hurriedly tucks it up,
out of sight. Then she sees Parked outside - a delivery van, with “Somerson’s Pianos”
written on the side.
Vera stops, dismayed - immediately looks at Edward, who looks
sheepish. Fearing the worst, she hurries to the garden path
and strides up it, Edward and Victor right behind her.
VERA
(furious, thrown back at
Edward)
You knew about this!
EDWARD
I knew Father wanted you to have
one VERA
You colluded with them!
No -!

EDWARD

Vera goes through the open doorway, into the house 10

INT. HALLWAY/LIVING ROOM, MELROSE - CONTINUOUS

10

Vera sweeps along the hallway, towards the living room The sounds of a heavy object being moved into place, the
CLANG of piano keys VERA enters the living room, to see delivery men manoeuvering
a GRAND PIANO, overseen by her parents, Mr. and Mrs.
BRITTAIN, and family friend Mrs. ELLINGER, with a teen
daughter in tow.
Mr. Brittain is a self-made businessman, extrovert, kind, but
prone to outbursts of temper and depressions.

Salmon Revision 21.04.14

7

His wife is both more delicate and more level-headed - once
less conventional than her husband, now the subservient wife,
she flaps on the surface, but underneath exerts complete
domestic control.
MR. BRITTAIN
(seeing her)
Vera! Come and see your surprise!
Her mother comes over and takes her arm.
MRS. BRITTAIN
I’ve been dying to tell you, but I
just couldn’t. Mrs. Ellinger’s been
in on the secret, she wants to hear
you play!
Mr. Brittain opens the piano lid with a flourish. Vera holds
back, her expression is tight and sullen.
MR. BRITTAIN
She’s an absolute beauty - so I’m
told. Come on darling, give us a
taste of what we can look forward
to!
As the delivery men finish and leave, Mrs. Brittain takes a
seat next to a very proper Mrs. Ellinger and her daughter.
Victor sits too.
An expectant silence. Edward gives Vera a pained look - he
understands her feelings. She goes and sits at the piano - Stares at the keys for a long beat Hands raised Then brings them CRASHING down, BANGING out a CACOPHANY!
She stops - stark silence. Her mother and Mrs. Ellinger look
shocked. Vera leaps up and heads for the door, her father
immediately on her trail 11

INT. LIVING ROOM DOOR/HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

11

Mr. Brittain stops her before she can go any further.
MR. BRITTAIN
Vera! Come back and apologise now!
Vera’s expression is defiant. Mrs. Brittain hovers anxiously
in the background with the others.
MR. BRITTAIN (CONT’D)
If you can’t show me the respect I
deserve, then at least show some
for our guests!

Salmon Revision 21.04.14

Their faces are close, Vera’s pent-up anger and hurt almost
bursting out.
VERA
I don’t want a piano. You knew I
didn’t want one and still you
bought it! I won’t be bullied by
you!
Mr. Brittain turns to his wife, looking incredulous.
MR. BRITTAIN
I buy her the most expensive gift
of her life, but no, I’m bullying
her!
MRS. BRITTAIN
Your father hoped you’d be happy,
dear VERA
That piano could pay for a whole
year at Oxford!
MR. BRITTAIN
Ah, here we go again!
VERA
(bursting)
All this time you said you couldn’t
afford for me to go!
MR. BRITTAIN
I can’t afford to waste money, no!
Vera glowers at him in speechless fury - turns and STOMPS
upstairs.
He glances at his wife, who gives him an admonishing look MR. BRITTAIN
Vera - I didn’t mean - VERA! Come
back here!
MRS BRITTAIN
Oh dear. (to Mrs Ellinger) I do
apologise...
11A

INT. VERA’S BEDROOM, BUXTON - A SECOND LATER

11A

Vera is in her room, looking round for an outlet for her fury
and frustration She sees a pile of papers on her desk, covered in her
scrawled hand writing, and a small pile of books - she
gathers up the whole lot, marches over to the window, chucks
it all out -

INT. HALLWAY - SAME TIME

11B

Edward is starting up the stairs after Vera, when they hear
the thud of objects falling - - they turn to see, through the
open doorway behind them, a shower of papers floating down to
the ground.
Mr. Brittain groans in exasperation. Vera charges back down
the stairs.
VERA
I’ve thrown my work out, you can
take it to your factory and pulp it
for all I care!
MR BRITTAIN
Now stop it! I’m simply concerned
you’re turning yourself into a
bluestocking, because they don’t
find husbands!
VERA
I don’t want a husband!
On VICTOR - a little crestfallen at this.
VERA
How many times do I have to spell
it out?! I’m sorry you didn’t have
a daughter whose sole purpose in
life is to hitch herself to a man,
but there it is! I’m not getting
married, not now, not ever!
A sound makes them all turn. ROLAND stands there, holding
his luggage; well-built, with an intense gaze and a selfassurance beyond his 19 years, he’s a physical, sensual
person. We see him from Vera’s perspective.
Everyone is caught by the moment. After a pause ROLAND
(small smile)
Well. That’s clear, then.
Vera glares at him for a moment, then turns and stomps
upstairs. Edward and Victor descend on him, shaking hands.
12

INT. LIVING ROOM - EVENING

12

A maid lights an oil lamp as Edward sits at the piano, his
musician’s hands running along the keys, playing a gentle
melody. He hears a sound, looks up, sees Vera watching him,
as the maid slips out.

Salmon Revision 21.04.14

10

EDWARD
I’ve lost track of how long I’ve
wanted one of these.
Vera comes and sits next to him at the piano.
VERA
(contrite)
Oh Edward, I was so caught up in
myself - I didn’t think what this
must be like for you.
EDWARD
(the piano)
She certainly didn’t deserve the
treatment you gave her.
VERA
Well - I got you your piano, that’s
something to be happy about at
least.
EDWARD
Oxford really means a lot to you,
doesn’t it?
VERA
(heart felt)
I can’t breathe here...
Edward smiles in understanding, he plays a few bars.
VERA (CONT’D)
We’ll escape marriage and the paper
factory yet!
He carries on playing - a beautiful melody. Vera is lost in
the music for a moment, gazing at her brother with love and
awe at his talent.
A sound makes them look up. Roland and Victor come in. Edward
keeps playing. They come over and listen to the music, Roland
watching Vera.
Something in his gaze makes her feel self-conscious. She gets
up, walks to the other side of the room.
Victor joins Edward at the piano and they switch into a
jaunty duet. Then Roland joins them - they all play together,
a fun routine that’s obviously familiar.
Vera watches them, chuckling - seeing how united they are.
13

EXT. GARDEN, MELROSE - TWILIGHT

13

Vera is outside in the dark, searching in the shrubbery for
her books and papers.

Salmon Revision 21.04.14

10A

From inside, we can hear the piano still being played. A
sound makes her start - she turns to see Roland, smoking a
cigarette, quietly watching her.
VERA
You frightened me!
ROLAND
Can I help?

Salmon Revision 21.04.14

No thanks.

11

VERA

But he stubs his cigarette out,

starts searching anyway.

VERA (CONT’D)
Please, I’d rather be by myself.
ROLAND
(playful)
It’s the books I’m worried about,
I’ve never seen anyone beat them up
that way!
Roland finds a few battered books. Then picks up a piece of
paper, glowing white in the dusk. He sees it’s a hand-written
poem, and makes the snap decision to pocket it.
ROLAND
(looking at the books)
Wordsworth, Shelley. Poor Byron.
All these romantics aren’t good for
you, you know.
She snatches them from him, examines them for damage, then
leafs through the pages, as though looking for something.
VERA
Don’t worry, they have very little
influence.
ROLAND
(a smile)
So I saw earlier.
She flashes him a look. His self-confidence both riles and
attracts her.
ROLAND (CONT’D)
(more sincere)
I’m sorry about the badly timed
arrival, by the way.
VERA
(defensive)
Why should I care?
She starts to head back inside, then stops, turns to him VERA (CONT’D)
I can see this is all highly
amusing for you No -

ROLAND

Salmon Revision 21.04.14

12

VERA
Yes, you’re polishing up the
anecdote already, for your friends
back at school! (Raw) But it’s my
life -!
Exasperated with herself, and embarrassed, she heads back
inside. Roland thinks for a moment - touched by her. Then
produces the poem he pocketed. He reads, his expression
moved.
14

INT. VERA’S ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

14

Vera is up with some open text books before her, studying.
There’s a knock at the door. Startled, she gets up, goes and
opens it. Roland stands there.
VERA
(thrown)
What?
ROLAND
(smiling)
You’re studying.
VERA
What of it?
ROLAND
(more vulnerable)
Nothing, I - Look, I’ve done the
Oxford entrance exams, it’s all
about technique. I could help you.
Once you’ve learnt it, you’ll sail
through I’m sure.
VERA
Like a masonic secret, passed from
teacher to boy.
ROLAND
Actually my teachers weren’t that
good. I worked it out for myself.
She looks at him - the reaching out to her beneath the
smooth, confident surface.
VERA
(softly)
Then so will I.
She closes the door in his face. Taken aback by herself, she
leans against the door with a smile.

Roland is also taken aback. But after a moment, he turns away
with a smile.
15A

EXT. COUNTRYSIDE, BUXTON - DAY

15A

The three men and Vera are walking up a beautiful, gently
sloping green hill, talking and laughing together. The boys
are ribbing Vera, who takes it in good humour - she teases
Edward back, giving as good as she gets.
16

EXT. HILLSIDE OUTSIDE BUXTON - LATER

16

Vera, Edward, Roland and Victor are lying or sitting on the
hillside, gazing at the countryside stretched out before them
in the green beauty of spring. The atmosphere is relaxed.
ROLAND
(lightly - the view)
The world at our feet!
EDWARD
(grimace)
Except we’re nearly back at school.
ROLAND
We’re here now, Ted, come on. Live
in the moment a little.
VICTOR
One more term and it’ll all be
over. It’s sort of daunting, seeing
your whole life stretched out in
front of you. I mean, wonderful
too...
ROLAND
I’ll stick with wonderful.
VERA
At least you won’t be buried alive
in Buxton.
EDWARD
Come on, think of all the gossip
you’re providing the local ladies
with!
VERA
Talking of which, Mrs Fraser mixed
her china sets at dinner last week.
The whole town’s buzzing with it!
EDWARD
The triviality of female lives...

Salmon Revision 21.04.14
Vera playfully swats Edward.
VERA
Don’t you dare...!
ROLAND
(a chuckle)
Have we got a suffragette on our
hands?
VERA
I would be, given the chance, I
suppose that shocks you?
EDWARD
You’re talking to the wrong man,
Vera. Roland’s a supporter.

13A

Salmon Revision 21.04.14

14

Vera assumes he’s joking.
ROLAND
Well, my mother does admire them.
EDWARD
She’s a novelist, and she writes
for the papers, she supports the
whole family in fact. (To Roland) I
hope you don’t mind me saying...?
ROLAND
(smiling)
Not now I’ve seen Vera’s face!
Vera is thrown.
VERA
I had no idea....
ROLAND
Perhaps you’ve jumped to
conclusions about me.
VERA
I think that’s mutual.
ROLAND
No, I’ve researched you quite
thoroughly. I found a poem in the
garden, in fact, and took the
liberty - (of reading it)
As he takes the piece of paper from his pocket EDWARD
(interrupting)
Poems! You’ve kept that very quiet!
Let’s have a look!
He takes it off Roland - Vera snatches it off him VERA
Give it back! It’s nothing - it’s
just a - stupid thing!
She pockets the poem, upset and humiliated. Roland realises
his mistake.
ROLAND
I’m sorry, I thought...you two...
He gestures to her and Edward.
VERA
It’s fine...
They sit there in awkward silence.

VICTOR
(trying to lighten the
atmosphere)
I don’t know about anyone else, but
I could do with a drink of
something.
17

EXT. GREEN GLADE, OUTSIDE BUXTON - A LITTLE LATER
On the way back - Vera has deliberately slowed her pace to
fall behind the others, needing a moment alone. Roland
carefully approaches her. We can hear Edward and Victor
talking and laughing off-screen.
ROLAND
I didn’t know you kept it secret VERA
Really. That’s why you stole it
from me and stored it to use like
- like ammunition!
No -

ROLAND

VERA
Stop pretending!
ROLAND
I kept quiet because - I was
moved by it, I thought it
beautiful, and - you seem an
impossible person to say that to.
This silences her. She plays with a stick she’s picked up.
A long moment.
I’m not.
No.

VERA
ROLAND

VERA
(hesitant, more open)
You really - don’t think me
ridiculous?
He smiles, shakes his head.
VERA
What if I told you I want to be a
writer - and - I even dream of
earning a living by it?
Roland smiles his gentle, confident smile.

17

Salmon Revision 21.04.14

16

ROLAND
Don’t you need some experience
first?
Of course!

VERA

A beat.
ROLAND
I want to write too, as it happens I’m a little in my mother’s shadow.
She looks at him VERA
Is she good?
He nods.
VERA
How’s she done it..?
ROLAND
Sheer pig-headedness. You should
meet her, you’d get on.
They both laugh gently.
ROLAND
(sincere)
You must write. Really.
VERA
No one’s ever said that to me
before.
They smile.

EXT. WHITE ROAD, BUXTON - LATER

19

They’re on the way home. Vera, holding some flowers she’s
gathered, walks ahead of the three men, down a long, winding
white road across the gentle sloping hills.
She can hear them chatting and laughing behind her, she turns
to look back at them And her eyes directly meet Roland’s. He’s been concentrating
on her. She looks away again, in sudden shyness....

INT. VERA’S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

20

Vera is putting some of the flowers she collected into
frames. She snaps a frame shut, takes it across to the wall
to hang there, when she catches a glimpse of herself in a
long mirror - she looks again at her reflection, suddenly thinking about
herself in a different way, as a woman She runs her hands over her waist, her hips, turning to look
at herself, trying to assess her appeal.
She puts a finger to her lips - imagining his kiss She starts at a sound at the door; goes over. Someone is on
the other side, she can feel the presence; she knows it’s
him. Quietly, she presses her body against the door Roland, on the other side, is very still too A rustling noise - she looks down. He’s pushing a piece of
paper under the door - a poem. She picks it up and reads:
“Untitled” by Roland Leighton - a soft smile.
Vera waits, listening - to his presence retreating down the
corridor.
21

INT. HALLWAY/LIVING ROOM, MELROSE - MORNING

21

Vera is in front of a hallway mirror, checking her appearance
- she’s made more effort than usual with her dress.
Satisfied, she walks on down the hall when she hears voices
in the living room. She stops to listen.
EDWARD O.S.
It’s just three years of study,
father. You know women don’t even
get degrees at Oxford?
Vera peeps through the crack in the door, sees Edward pacing
in front of her father.
MR.BRITTAIN
Three years of extra expense!
EDWARD
I’d share my allowance with her,
that would help.
MR.BRITTAIN
What if she doesn’t get in? Don’t
you need tuition for such a thing?
EDWARD
You could let her have a shot at
it.

EDWARD (cont'd)
I wouldn’t feel right about going
myself if she didn’t have the
chance. She’s always been so
bright.
Vera watches Edward, feeling grateful, as her father ponders.
He looks up, catches sight of her. She ducks quickly out of
sight.
Vera!

MR. BRITTAIN’S VOICE

She winces - turns and enters the living room. Comes and
stands before her father.
MR. BRITTAIN
Very well. You can sit the wretched
thing if you want to.
Vera is overjoyed - she hugs her father.
VERA
Thank you Daddy!
MR. BRITTAIN
You’re just sitting it, mind! Then
we’ll see. Now play me some of that
piano!
Vera laughs. Edward watches, smiling.
22

INT. STAIRCASE, MELROSE - DAY (SPRING)

22

Vera is pinned to the staircase wall, making way for Edward
and Victor as they clatter past with suitcases and boxes - on
their way back to school.
Vera follows them downstairs as Mr. Brittain, dressed to
drive his car, strides into the hallway.
MR. BRITTAIN
Come on, you’ll miss the train!
Vera pursues Edward into the hall, glancing up the stairs
every now and then, wondering where Roland is. Outside, Mr.
Brittain and Victor are loading up the car.
VERA
I don’t want you to go.
He gives her a smile and a quick hug.
EDWARD
We’ll have the whole summer.
Victor comes back in and shakes her hand, as Mrs. Brittain
appears.

Salmon Revision 21.04.14

Good bye.
Victor...

19

VICTOR
VERA

He acts cheerful - but she sees the hurt in his eyes.
EDWARD
We’d better be off...
Victor turns to say goodbye to Mrs. Brittain, as Vera sees
Roland finally coming down the stairs. She hurries over to
him.
VERA
I wish you weren’t going so soon!
ROLAND
Did you read the poem?
VERA
(slightly caught out)
Of course.
And?

ROLAND

VERA
(hesitant)
It’s well crafted.
But -?

ROLAND

VERA
It was a little - dry. As though
you were holding back. And
possibly slightly derivative.
ROLAND
(stung)
Derivative.
VERA
I couldn’t find you in it.
ROLAND
Well I can assure you it’s mine!
VERA
Of course, I didn’t mean EDWARD
(calling)
Roland, Come on! We’re already
late!

19A

Vera watches in dismay as Roland throws her a final, tight
smile, and heads out. She joins her mother at the doorway as
Roland runs to leap aboard the car, already creeping along
the drive. The atmosphere is jovial -

Salmon Revision 21.04.14

But Vera is worried, upset with herself VERA’S VOICE
Edward, send me news of Roland
Leighton. Tell him - how much I
enjoyed meeting him, will you? You
know I can be my own worst enemy 23

INT. VERA’S BEDROOM, MELROSE - DAY

23

A happy Vera falls back onto her bed, holding an envelope;
she opens it, takes out a letter and starts to read.
ROLAND’S VOICE
Edward assures me you won’t mind me
writing direct. You set me a
challenge, you see, and I’ve done
my best to meet it.
A piece of paper floats out - she sees it’s a poem.
ROLAND’S VOICE
I hope you find more feeling in
this one.
Vera reads the poem, emotions flitting across her face.
ROLAND’S VOICE
Down the long white road we walked
together
Down between the grey hills and the
heather,
You seemed all brown and soft, just
like a linnet..
24

INT. VERA’S BEDROOM - LATER

24

Vera sits at her desk, eagerly writing a letter back to
Roland.

Your errant hair had shadowed
sunbeams in it...
And there shone all April
In your eyes.

INT./EXT. TRAIN/OXFORD - DAY

26

A smartly-dressed Vera, accompanied by her chaperone AUNT
BELLE - a small, round, warm but flustered woman - is sitting
in a train compartment looking out of the window;

Salmon Revision 21.04.14

on the horizon, the beautiful, sunlit spires of Oxford
shimmer into view, redolent with promise....
27

EXT. BROAD STREET, OXFORD - DAY

27

Vera is walking down Broad Street as Aunt Belle hurries to
keep up with her, chattering away like background noise.
Vera drinks in the sights - students cycling around on
bikes, or engaged in animated conversation, the Radcliffe
Camera - it all looks wonderful.
28

EXT. SOMERVILLE COLLEGE, OXFORD - DAY
Vera steps inside Somerville college, gazes around in awe
at the emerald lawns and elegant buildings, female
undergraduates passing by, as Aunt Belle witters on.
AUNT BELLE
(rapid)
I know you’re only here for two
nights but Oxford can get chilly
you know, it’s in a basinAunt -

VERA

AUNT BELLE
I bought you an extra nightie
just in case Aunt -

VERA

Vera has noticed two plainly-dressed female dons standing
nearby, gazing at her in puzzlement. One of them, Miss
LORIMER - glasses, youngish, clever, dry - approaches.
AUNT BELLE
I promised your mother to keep a
proper eye on you, she does worryVERA
Aunt, please!
AUNT BELLE
Bedsocks! (Seeing Vera’s face) My
final word!
Miss Lorimer is looking Vera up and down, taking in her
attire.
MISS LORIMER
I’m sorry, are you lost?

28

Salmon Revision 21.04.14
VERA
I’m here for the exam.
MISS LORIMER
(clearly surprised)
Oh. Well, the porter’s lodge is
that way, they’ll direct you.

Salmon Revision 21.04.14

22

VERA
(flustered)
Thank you.
Aunt Belle smiles at Miss Lorimer.
AUNT BELLE
I’m her Aunt Belle, I’ll be
staying nearby!
Miss Lorimer manages a patronising smile. As Vera and her
aunt turn to walk away, the other don approaches.
MISS LORIMER
Is it an entrance exam we’re
holding or a debutante’s ball?
Vera hears - and winces inwardly.
29

INT. DINING HALL, SOMERVILLE - EVENING

29

Dinner-time. We move along a row of women, all dressed in
serious black or grey, all scoffing heartily and talking.
We reach Vera, who stands out in a blaze of coloured silk,
like a provincial fashionista. She stares glumly at her
plate of rather grey food, half-listening to an animated
conversation.
CANDIDATE 1
It’s the Latin essay I’m
dreading.
Vera is instantly startled.
CANDIDATE 1 (CONT’D)
My tutor’s convinced Virgil will
come up. I hope he’s right.
Essay...?

VERA

The others carry on their conversation. On Vera - she
didn’t know.
30

INT. DINING HALL/EXAM HALL - MORNING
Vera is sitting in a silent exam hall full of young women,
as Miss Lorimer moves between the desks, placing exam
papers face down. She puts one down before a nervous Vera,
who stares at it.
MISS LORIMER
You may begin.

30

Salmon Revision 21.04.14

23

Vera turns the exam paper over, together with everyone else.
As she reads, her face fills with dismay. Around her, girls
start eagerly scribbling.
Miss Lorimer, walking through the rows, catches her eye for
the briefest moment.
Vera picks up her pen, takes a deep breath - and starts.
31

EXT. QUAD, SOMERVILLE - LATER

31

The candidates file out into the fresh air, chattering,
seemingly in high spirits. Vera emerges last, her shoulders
slumped, on the verge of tears. That didn’t go well.
As the crowd dissipates, she stands there, alone. Then she
sees Miss Lorimer, striding purposefully along some
cloisters. She follows.
Excuse me!

VERA

Miss Lorimer keeps walking.
VERA (CONT’D)
About the Latin paper...
Miss Lorimer glances at her impatiently.
MISS LORIMER
What is it?
VERA
It’s - I didn’t realise an essay
was required.
MISS LORIMER
It’s stated quite plainly.
VERA
I must’ve missed it. I didn’t have
a tutor, I’ve prepared for this by
myself.
Miss Lorimer stops, takes her in.
MISS LORIMER
You seemed to be busy writing,
Miss....
VERA
(wincing)
Brittain. I wrote it in German
instead.

Salmon Revision 21.04.14

24

MISS LORIMER
German! Perhaps where you come from
Latin and German can be equated,
but not here, I’m afraid.
She starts walking again, dismissing her.
VERA
You’ve judged me already!
Miss Lorimer turns, surprised, a little affronted.
VERA (CONT’D)
(nothing to lose)
You think I’m frivolous, a
provincial upstart, but I’m not!
A beat.
MISS LORIMER
I think you’re keen to stand out.
Vera’s face - proud, but wanting it so much....
Yes!

VERA

MISS LORIMER
(an ambiguous half-smile)
Good day, Miss Brittain.
She turns and walks away - Vera slumps - sure she’s blown it.
32

INT. LIVING ROOM, MELROSE - DAY

32

Vera is sitting with her mother, Mrs. Ellinger and several
other local ladies, talking and drinking tea. Vera fidgets,
bored.
VERA’S VOICE
It’s over, Edward. A disaster. I’ll
never escape Buxton now!
33

EXT. PLAYING FIELD, UPPINGHAM - DAY

33

A mud-splattered Roland and Edward are playing rugby on a
school playing field, running with the ball. Edward throws it
out of the scrum, he seems to look across at Vera and give
her a small smile.
VERA’S VOICE
Roland Leighton hasn’t written back
to me. Although, now I won’t be
joining you both at Oxford, perhaps
that’s for the best.

INT. ENTRANCE HALL, MELROSE - DAY (SUMMER)

34

It’s roughly six weeks later. Mrs. Brittain stands in the
hallway holding some hats, looking up the stairs.
VERA!

MRS. BRITTAIN

A flushed Vera comes thudding down the stairs. She’s wearing
a lovely dress.
MRS. BRITTAIN
Hurry hurry, strict instructions
from Edward, we can’t be late for
his parade -!
She takes in Vera’s very smart outfit.
MRS. BRITTAIN (CONT’D)
Goodness it’s only a school speech
day! (The hats) I don’t know if
these are going to be nice enough.
VERA
(impatient)
Of course they are.
Vera takes one and puts it on her head before the mirror. Her
mother looks at her.
No.

MRS. BRITTAIN

Vera takes it off - as some letters are pushed through the
letter box. She leaps on them immediately, rifling through sees the Oxford post stamp on one, and quickly pockets it.
MRS. BRITTAIN
What was that?
Vera fights not to show her tension Nothing.

VERA

She hands her mother the rest of the letters. Mrs. Brittain
purses her lips, but hands her another hat. They both look at
her reflection in the mirror.
No.

VERA/MRS. BRITTAIN

Her mother puts the final one on her.
MRS. BRITTAIN
That’s the one!
Vera pulls it off.

Salmon Revision 21.04.14

Awful!

26

VERA

Mrs. Brittain sighs with irritation.
MRS. BRITTAIN
What’s in the letter, dear?
Vera keeps stubbornly silent.
MRS. BRITTAIN (CONT’D)
You can’t go hiding things in this
way, Vera, now tell me!
VERA
(tense)
It’s from Oxford.
MRS. BRITTAIN
(disappointed)
Oh! I thought it might be from a
boy. Why don’t you open it?
Vera hears her father approaching.
VERA
Don’t tell father!
Mrs. Brittain sighs - her daughter perplexes her. She puts
the last hat back on Vera, as Mr. Brittain appears, absorbed
in reading a newspaper. We glimpse the headline: “Archduke
Shot, Austria in Turmoil”.
MRS. BRITTAIN
That one really is perfect. (To Mr.
Brittain) What do you think, dear?
Mr. Brittain is lost in his reading, a frown on his face.
Daddy!

VERA

MR. BRITTAIN
What? Oh. Perfect, yes.
Vera sighs, looks at her reflection.
MR. BRITTAIN (CONT’D)
Was that the right answer?
Mother and daughter share a smile.

EXT. SCHOOL APPROACH, UPPINGHAM - DAY

35

The glint of gun metal in the sun - we see rows of schoolboy
officer cadets, in gleaming uniforms, formed into neat rows
and stiffly marching, under orders of “Left, right..” from an
officer teacher.
On the sidelines, proud families stand watching the parade.
Vera threads between them, towards the front HEADMASTER’S VOICE
So as a new crop of Uppingham boys
step out onto life’s stage, we say
to them, be strong, be loyal, be
brave!
She picks out Edward, then Victor.... She gives them both a
smile, there’s a flicker of a smile in return. Her eyes
search for Roland - there he is. She makes eye contact,
smiles at him But he looks through her, his gaze fixed
distant goal she can’t share.

- as though on a
CUT TO:

EXT. SCHOOL APPROACH - CONTINUOUS

At one end, we FIND - the headmaster, speaking from a podium.
HEADMASTER
Loyal to yourselves, loyal to kith
and kin - but above all else, loyal
to your homeland, ready always to
serve the glory of our empire!
We MOVE OUT - to see the field of officer cadets before him,
still now, and listening to his every word. Row upon row of
them...
HEADMASTER
...For if a man cannot be useful to
his country, his life is surely
worth little at all!
They stand there, obedient. Innocent. Proud.
Ready.
Vera watches as the families break into polite applause.
37

EXT. SCHOOL APPROACH, UPPINGHAM - LATER

37

Groups of people are scattered across the court yard, chitchatting, Mr. and Mrs. Brittain among them. We find -

Salmon Revision 21.04.14

28

Vera and Edward, in his officer cadet uniform.
She pulls the Oxford letter from her pocket and shows him.
Edward sees it, and her nervousness. He takes her hand.
Come on.

EDWARD

Edward leads her towards a secluded corner.
38

EXT. SCHOOL APPROACH, UPPINGHAM - CONTINUOUS

38

Edward sees her nerves.
EDWARD
No one’ll disturb us here.
Vera holds out the letter in a trembling hand.
VERA
I know what it’s going to say!
EDWARD
Shall I...?
He gently takes the letter from her. She nods. He braces
himself, nervous too, and opens it.
She watches his face as he scans the contents, his expression
neutral.
He looks up at her for a beat - his face blank. She fears the
worse. Then he breaks into a gentle smile EDWARD
You got in.
Vera’s face - total SHOCK. Then she LIGHTS up - with
disbelief, with delight. Edward puts his arms round her,
LIFTS her up - they laugh and jump like two excited children Then - as he sets her down - referencing the letter EDWARD
But you have to work on your Latin.
Vera scans the letter, laughs.
EDWARD (CONT’D)
You better tell Roland.
VERA
(unsure)
Do you think...?
Go on!

EDWARD

Salmon Revision 21.04.14

She smiles, shy and excited at the thought - then turns and
runs off, he watches her go with a smile.

EXT. SCHOOL APPROACH, UPPINGHAM - SECONDS LATER

39

Vera moves through groups of people, until she spots Roland,
in his cadet uniform, standing talking to his parents, Mrs.
LEIGHTON, a tall woman in flamboyant dress, both sharply
bright and playful, and Mr. LEIGHTON, older, sophisticated,
with a walking stick and a limp. Victor is with them. He sees
Vera first, gestures her to come forward.
As she approaches ROLAND
Mother, father, this is Edward’s
sister Vera.
MRS. LEIGHTON
Oh! I didn’t know Edward had a
sister, how nice to meet you, dear.
Vera flashes a look at Roland, but his expression is
unreadable. She shakes hands with his parents, then greets
Victor.
VICTOR
You look happy about something.
VERA
I just heard, I got a place at
Somerville!
VICTOR
Wonderful! Congratulations!
MRS LEIGHTON
(playfully sly)
Ah, now suddenly she’s becoming a
very intriguing young lady, don’t
you think Roland?
Roland’s smile is reserved. Vera interprets this as
disinterest.
VERA
Excuse me, I must tell my parents She hurries away. Roland immediately excuses himself, and
follows after her.
He quickly catches up with Vera as she strides through groups
of people, standing chatting.
ROLAND
Vera! Wait!
What for?!
He knows....

VERA

Salmon Revision 21.04.14
ROLAND
Can we talk alone?
She hesitates, he gestures ahead.

29A

Salmon Revision 21.04.14

Please?

ROLAND

Vera looks reluctant, but nods her agreement. As they
disappear, we see Victor watching them...the disappointment
palpable in him. Mrs. Brittain also clocks them.
39A

EXT. WOODLAND PATH - CONTINUOUS

39A

Roland and Vera walk silently through the garden. Roland
wants to find them a more secluded place, he looks around,
then guides her round a corner, towards a half-crumbling
Greek folly covered in richly foaming roses.
40

EXT. GREEK FOLLY - CONTINUOUS

40

As they enter the folly ROLAND
It’s such good news about Oxford.
VERA
You don’t have to say that.
I know -

ROLAND

VERA
(blurting)
Look, if it’s friendship you want
that’s fine with me!
Vera winces at herself - was that too much? - but she ploughs
on.
VERA
I prefer clarity, that’s all!
ROLAND
No, it’s been a busy term, exams
and - ending school is quite a timeconsuming business, as it turns
out.
A beat. Awkwardness in the air.
VERA
Your mother didn’t even know I
exist.
ROLAND
No, that - that is self-protection.
He smiles his charming smile - then - sincerely now -

Salmon Revision 21.04.14

31

ROLAND (CONT’D)
It was wonderful seeing you at the
parade, more than I could’ve
imagined.
VERA
I’m unsure about this too, you
know! It’s not exactly what I had
planned!
Roland reaches into an inside pocket and takes out the letter
she sent him.
ROLAND
I’ve been carrying it around with
me.
A beat.
VERA
So why didn’t you write back?
ROLAND
Not good with words...?
VERA
(glimmer of a smile)
For someone who wants to be a
writer...
A warmer beat ROLAND
We’ll be able to see each other
every day.
VERA
(shaking her head)
I’ll be concentrating on my work.
ROLAND
You’ll need fresh air, surely. And
a chaperone? (Off her look) Lap
dog? Humble slave?
He wants to get her to smile - she does. He takes her hand,
softly - pulls her towards him.
ROLAND
(intimate whisper)
Vera...Let’s agree. No more fear.
They look into one another’s eyes VERA
No more fear...
as Mrs. Brittain’s voice CRASHES in -

Salmon Revision 21.04.14

VERA!

32

MRS. BRITTAIN O.S.

They turn to see her mother descending on them.
MRS. BRITTAIN
What do you think you’re doing?!
This isn’t proper at all!
Roland steps forward.
ROLAND
I’m sorry, I’d like permission to
see Vera again, Mrs. Brittain.
Fully chaperoned, of course.
Vera and Roland smile at one another.

EXT. TRAIN, COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

INT. TRAIN CARRIAGE - DAY

endlessly about it...

EXT. TRAIN PLATFORM, CHARING CROSS - DAY (SUMMER)

Vera strides along a train platform, full of eager
anticipation, followed by a huffing and puffing Aunt Belle.
VERA’S VOICE (CONT’D)
...but terrible as it sounds, as
long as I get on that train to
London I just don’t care!
Up ahead, she spots Roland waiting, an apricot pink rose in
his hands. She hurries over, stops before him.
They’re both suddenly tongue-tied.
Awkwardly, he hands her the rose. She opens her coat and
fixes it in the waistband of her blue satin dress.

Salmon Revision 21.04.14

33

On Roland’s face - his pleasure. As Aunt Belle reaches them,
huffing AUNT BELLE
I won’t get in your way! I know
what young love is!
Vera and Roland share a look.
43

EXT. LONDON STREET - LATER

43

Roland and Vera are walking fast down a London street, as
Aunt Belle struggles to keep up.
AUNT BELLE
Slow down you two! Your mother
was very particular that I They round a corner, disappearing from view. She sighs.
ON Roland and Vera, walking fast.
ROLAND
Can we shake her off?
VERA
Mother’s expecting a full report
back, no details spared.
They smile like conspirators. Roland sees a theatre up ahead,
pulls Vera towards it. Aunt Belle appears round the corner,
sees them and follows.
44

INT. THEATRE - MINUTES LATER

44

A show is taking place on stage, the theatre is almost empty.
Roland pulls Vera along an empty row of seats, they sit next
to one another, and he drapes one arm across the back of her
seat. Aunt Belle follows, squeezing along the row past Vera,
then stops.
AUNT BELLE
(to Roland)
Move along, dear.
Reluctantly, Roland moves up a place. Aunt Belle sits herself
firmly down between them with a smug expression. Vera smiles.
Roland carefully reaches an arm behind Aunt Belle, finds
Vera’s neck, and caresses it gently. Aunt Belle realises and,
with an abrupt push of her shoulders, knocks his arm off.
Vera and Roland suppress their laughter.

Roland and Vera hurry together, ahead of Aunt Belle.
ROLAND

INT. ART GALLERY - MINUTES LATER

45A

Roland and Vera are in a silent gallery, gazing at paintings
on the walls - Aunt Belle is nearby. ON Roland’s expression irritated that they still haven’t lost her.
But he sees she’s before a painting, absorbed in it. He
guides Vera carefully towards an exit, right behind an
oblivious Aunt Belle...
46

INT. STAIRWELL, ART GALLERY - CONTINUOUS

46

They burst like truants into a secluded stairwell, laughing.
ROLAND
I thought we’d lost her at the
impressionists!
Vera laughs.
VERA
Aunt Belle’s got eyes in the back
of her head!
ROLAND
We’re being very bad, you know,
we’re going to get a terrible
report.
VERA
Mother won’t be surprised. She
finds me constantly exasperating.
She thinks she has a very odd
daughter.
ROLAND
Not odd, just different.
They stop, Roland turns to her - both suddenly aware they’re
alone. Roland is close now - he wants to kiss her.
VERA
I’ve never known where I fit.

Salmon Revision 21.04.14

35

Roland takes her by the upper arms, pulls her a little closer
to him ROLAND
Does it need to be a place?
He leans in to kiss her, he’s just about to - when Aunt Belle
appears on the very periphery of their vision.
Well!

AUNT BELLE

They both see her. Roland keeps looking at Vera, tightens his
grip in frustration - as Aunt Belle hurries towards them AUNT BELLE
I don’t know what to say to the
pair of you, really I don’t!
47

INT. TRAIN STATION - LATER

47

The three of them are walking through the station, Aunt Belle
between them now.
AUNT BELLE
My feet are hurting, we better call
it a day.
She sees a newspaper stand.
AUNT BELLE
A newspaper, and a cup of tea,
that’s what I need. I’ll be back in
a minute.
She hurries off towards the newspaper stand, which is
surrounded by a small crowd. Vera turns to Roland with a
smile.
VERA
We’ll see each other again soon...
ON - Aunt Belle reading her paper at the stand, on the
billboard, is written: “GERMANY - ULTIMATUM TO WAR!” The
people around her are buzzing - mutterings such as:
“They’ve got until morning” “I said it would come to this!”
“They’re not to be trusted!”
She looks across - at Vera and Roland, lost in one another,
oblivious.
48

INT. TRAIN COMPARTMENT - LATER
Vera is sitting opposite Aunt Belle, travelling home in a
reverie. Aunt Belle is talking to some other passengers.
Gradually, Vera tunes in -

PASSENGER 1
...My boys will be at the head of
the queue, and it’ll be a long one!
There isn’t a lad in the country

bloody Kaiser!
They all nod. Vera picks up a newspaper and starts reading,
her expression suddenly troubled.
49

INT. VERA’S BEDROOM, MELROSE - NEXT EVENING

49

Vera is finishing changing into her night dress. As she
turns, she catches a glimpse of herself in the mirror, and
spots a faint purple bruise and a red mark on her upper arm,
where Roland gripped her. She smiles in soft delight, as the
memory of that moment floods back to her...touches the marks
with her fingertips, then turns with a start, as Edward
knocks at the door then walks in.
EDWARD
I’ve been talking to father about
signing up.
Vera is taken aback.
VERA
Already...?
EDWARD
I’m an officer cadet. This is what
we trained for.
ON Vera - as she realises he’s right.
EDWARD
Father was his usual calm self,
said he’d rather put a gun to his
head than let me go!
Vera’s mind is whirring.
VERA
It’s all happening so fast EDWARD
There are boys from town who’ve
signed up already. How will it look
if I’m not among them?
VERA
I’ll talk to him. (Off his look)
Calmly, I promise!
Edward gets to his feet.

Salmon Revision 21.04.14

37

EDWARD
I should let you sleep. (Sees the
marks on her arm) What happened to
you?
VERA
(hastily covering up)
Nothing.
As Edward heads for the door VERA
I don’t think Roland will go. He’s
really not the military type.
Edward looks at her.
EDWARD
Don’t go losing your head over him.
Why not?

VERA

A beat - then Vera grabs a cushion and playfully chucks it at
him. He grins, ducks out.

I know a little more of war than
you, young lady, and believe me,
it’s never short and never fast!
Vera takes a deep breath, contains herself.

Salmon Revision 21.04.14

38

VERA
If we believe that from the outset
it becomes a self-fulfilling
prophecy, doesn’t it?! Maybe this
time, this generation, if everyone
plays their part, it might just be
over quickly like they’re saying.
He might not even see any fighting!
He looks at her - his expression haunted.
MR. BRITTAIN
You’re so young VERA
What’s Edward going to say when
everyone around him is signing up
and he isn’t?
A pause VERA (CONT’D)

She can barely hear him.

Roland? Are you alright?
At a look from Vera her mother makes a token retreat, but
she’s all ears.
ROLAND’S VOICE

VERA
(not wanting to be heard)
Tomorrow morning’s train. I change
at Leicester.

you thereThe line crackles - and cuts off. Vera tries, but he’s gone.
She hangs up, smiling to herself. Her mother bustles over.
MRS. BRITTAIN
Why did he want to know that? You
can’t travel alone together!
Vera looks at her, half-pleading, half-defiant.

Please, mother..?
She waits.

Alright. Don’t mention it to your

Vera smiles gratefully.

She sinks down onto a seat under the impact of this news.
Roland sits next to her.

ROLAND
My Uncle Theo’s a military man. He
pulled some strings.
VERA
Did he push you to it?
ROLAND
No! No I - asked him to.

I’ll be in Norwich, it’s not even
active service. You wouldn’t want
me not to?
She shakes her head miserably.
ROLAND (CONT’D)
There’ll be months of training, by
which point the whole thing could
be over. Ted and I will probably be
coming to Oxford with you in the
new year!
Vera has tears rolling down her cheeks. Roland is upset,
confused himself - he puts an arm round her.
He turns her face to him - they KISS, finally, for the first
time, a hungry, passionate, long-awaited kiss.
CUT TO:
- The BLUR of TRAIN WHEELS chugging along the tracks 57

INT. TRAIN COMPARTMENT - LATER

Roland and Vera sit holding each other in exhausted silence,
as, outside the window, a vista of the dreaming spires of
Oxford comes into view.
VERA
Isn’t it strange, that I’m the one
going to Oxford without Edward or
you.
Roland holds her closer...his uncertainty showing...
CUT TO:
The TRAIN wheels churning round...
- As a SPADE DIGS into brown earth - We see a MAN digging a
trench.
Behind him, other men are digging.
CLOSE ON the man’s spade as it uproots a beautiful flower As THE TRAIN speeds on The man, cigarette in mouth, climbs out of the trench -

He throws his cigarette down, crushes it with his boot, gazes
around him. We see what he sees - a tranquil, silent meadow,
SLASHED across with trenches Like open wounds in the green earth.

EXT. QUAD, SOMERVILLE - DAY

58

Vera is walking along a quad, books in her arms, when Miss
Lorimer nearly bumps into her.
MISS LORIMER
Ah, Miss Brittain, surprised to
be here no doubt?
VERA
Considering I had no tuition...
Miss Lorimer’s rudeness always manages to be eccentric
rather than spiteful.
MISS LORIMER
Yes, and how it showed. Luckily you
also displayed an original mind.
Although whether you can bring any
discipline to bear on it is quite
another matter.
And with that, she walks off. Vera looks after her, lost
for words.
59

INT. LIBRARY, OXFORD - DAY

59

Vera is getting some books down from a shelf, she carries
them over to the desk where she’s working.
VERA’S VOICE
I’m trying my best, Roland. But
there’s little peace of mind for me
anymore. Every time I open a book,
it’s your face I see.

OMMITTED.

INT. VERA’S ROOM - DAWN (AUTUMN)

61

Vera is scribbling an essay. Through her window, we see an
early sun rising over the Oxford spires. Vera stops writing,
pulls out a half-written letter to Roland, and adds to it.
VERA’S VOICE
Of course I want to ask you to
leave the army and come to Oxford.

VERA’S VOICE (cont'd)
We should be here together! But I
can’t do that. I won’t.
62

EXT. BROAD STREET, OXFORD - DAY

62

Vera is making her way along Broad Street, among students on
foot and on bikes - ahead, on the other side of the road, she
sees VERA’S VOICE
Victor’s been turned down because
of his poor eyesight...
- EDWARD, in a soldier’s uniform. He hasn’t seen her yet,
he’s looking for a way through the traffic - her view of him
is blocked by a passing vehicle VERA’S VOICE (CONT’D)
But Edward’s joining the Sherwood
Foresters soon.
Vera catches another glimpse of him Suddenly he’s a CHILD of 7, in baggy shorts and a short
haircut, beaming at her A cart passes - and it’s him again, the grown Edward in his
uniform. He sees her, smiles and crosses over VERA’S VOICE (CONT’D)
My heart lurched at the sight of
him - my little brother, suddenly
so grown up - at the thought of all
of you, headed for the unknown. It
comforts me at least to know you’re
both on English soil.
Vera and Edward embrace.
63

OMMITTED.

64

EXT. QUAD, SOMERVILLE - MORNING

64

Vera emerges from a staircase entrance to see, around the
area of the porter’s lodge, stacks of metal beds and
mattresses piled up, while porters carry more in. One of them
says to a colleague - “convalescent ward’s in the next quad”.
Vera turns to see a man in a wheelchair at the college
entrance - a war veteran. He’s young, barely twenty, with
bandaged stumps where his arms once were. He’s slumped
awkwardly, to one side, and slides a little further down
without being able to right himself. Vera feels his
humiliation. Their eyes meet briefly.

Salmon Revision 21.04.14

44

A NURSE comes bustling over, sees his predicament and helps
sit him up. Vera watches the nurse’s smile, the boy’s
gratitude...
65

OMMITTED.

66

INT. PORTER’S LODGE/POST ROOM - DAY

66

Vera is taking letters out of her pigeon hole. One, a
telegram, catches her eye. She quickly tears it open.
ROLAND V.O.
Leave for France Thursday. Charing
Cross, twelve o’clock. Please
confirm can come. Roland.
Vera looks up, utterly stunned; the news she had been
dreading.
67

INT. MISS LORIMER’S ROOM - DAY
Vera stands before Miss Lorimer, who is sitting in a faded
armchair, knitting with intent. The hearth is empty. On a
side table is a photo of a fresh-faced young man.
MISS LORIMER
We can’t let students go
gallivanting off to London!
VERA
(fuming)
It’s not a gallivant MISS LORIMER
We have to work twice as hard as
the men, Miss Brittain, we have to
be twice as good! Otherwise what’s
the point of us fighting all these
years to prove we’re worthy of
degrees?
VERA
It’s to say good bye to someone
going to the front.
The needles work furiously. Vera notices the photo.
VERA
(risking it)
You have someone there already
perhaps...?
Miss Lorimer throws Vera a cross look.

67

Salmon Revision 21.04.14

45

MISS LORIMER
My brother.
She holds up the sock, full of mistakes.
MISS LORIMER
Not where my abilities are best
expressed. But then that’s war for
you, isn’t it. The men go and
fight, and we stay behind - and
knit.
VERA
How many pairs of socks will it
take...?
They share a smile.
MISS LORIMER
You’ll be back the same day?
Yes.

VERA

MISS LORIMER
And you’ll have a chaperone.
Yes.

VERA

Miss Lorimer nods her consent.
Thank you!
68

VERA

INT. CHARING CROSS TRAIN STATION - DAY

68

Vera strides down a bustling platform towards Roland,
standing waiting for her. He looks pale and weak, not his
usual self. Behind him is a poster of a gorilla holding a
fainting maid in one arm, a club in the other. It reads
“Enlist Now! Destroy this Mad Brute!”
The platform is bustling with soldiers and their families
and friends. A certain cheerful British repression prevails
- no one wants to make a fuss.
Vera runs up to him, wanting to hug him. But she stops short.
They look at one another.
VERA
(eyes burning)
How long do we have?
ROLAND
About an hour.

Salmon Revision 21.04.14

46

Vera’s face - so little time.
VERA
You told me you weren’t going to
France yet!
Vera -

ROLAND

VERA
(realising)
You got a transfer!
Roland nods.
VERA
You’re so eager to face death,
then, are you?!
No -

ROLAND

VERA
Yes you are, you must be!
Please...

ROLAND

She sees his face - suddenly vulnerable, hot with fever. She
feels his forehead, as Aunt Belle comes bustling up.
VERA
You’re sick, you’ve got a fever!
I can’t even be angry with you
now!
Roland can’t help a weak smile.
AUNT BELLE
(reaching them)
Oh, doesn’t he look handsome in
that uniform!
69

INT. CAFE, TRAIN STATION - LATER

69

Roland and Vera sit at a table together, as Aunt Belle
bustles round them. She gets some aspirin from her handbag,
gives them to Roland.
AUNT BELLE
Take these, dear, they’ll bring
the fever down.
Thank you.

ROLAND

Salmon Revision 21.04.14

47

Roland gets up to fetch the tea from the counter, but Aunt
Belle pushes him back down.
AUNT BELLE
Don’t you move, I’ll get it.
She bustles off. They turn to one another, their fingertips
lightly touching on the table.
VERA
(immediately)
I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to be
harsh.
ROLAND
I’ve let you down.
No -

VERA

ROLAND
Now it’s here I have a dust and
ashes feeling about it.
They gaze at
returning to
kindness and

one another, too choked to speak. Aunt Belle,
the table, sees them - her face shows her
sympathy. She puts the tea things down, starts
tea.

AUNT BELLE
Influenza’s ripping through the
troops, you know, I read about it
in the paper. Still, you’ll be
right as rain in no time, and
don’t you worry about Vera,
she’ll be taken good care of,
won’t you dear?
A pause, filled with aching silence. Aunt Belle looks at
them both AUNT BELLE
What? Too deep for words?
She sees it really is - sighs in sad sympathy.
70

INT. CHARING CROSS TRAIN STATION - LATER

70

Roland, Vera and Aunt Belle emerge from a subway, up onto a
platform.
ROLAND
Over there.
Roland indicates a train - puffing out steam like a sinister,
waiting beast.

Salmon Revision 21.04.14

48

INT. CORRIDOR/TRAIN COMPARTMENT, CHARING CROSS - A LITTLE 71
LATER
Vera and Roland are bustled into an empty compartment by
Aunt Belle. An older couple try to enter the compartment
too, but Aunt Belle stops them - determined to give the
lovers their privacy.
AUNT BELLE
I’m sorry, this one’s taken!
As the older couple move off, Aunt Belle throws Vera and
Roland a sympathetic look and shuts the compartment door,
leaving them alone together.
Roland moves over to her, puts his arms around her and kisses
her - passionate, desperate. They hold onto one another.
ROLAND
I am coming back.
A whistle blows, there’s a bustle in the corridor, voices
shout, as people hurry to get off the train. They get to
their feet; suddenly, time has run out.
Already!

72

VERA

INT. CORRIDOR/TRAIN DOOR - CONTINUOUS

72

Roland and Vera are caught in a wave of pushing, shoving
bodies headed for the train door. Around them, couples kiss
goodbye, relatives cling to their loved ones, the buttonedup mood has transformed into near-hysteria. As they reach
the door, Vera is suddenly tumbled outside by the crowd.
She pushes and shoves to get back in, but the door is
slammed shut. Aunt Belle is nearby in the heaving crowd.
Roland forces the window open, leans out. She grabs his
hand, they hold on tight.
With a great groan, the heavy train starts to move, the
women thronging around Vera fall away, but she keeps
holding onto Roland, refusing to let him go...
Roland -

VERA

ROLAND
We’ll write!
She runs with the train Their fingers pull apart - she lets go -

Salmon Revision 21.04.14

49

And she’s left there - watching Roland, every fibre of her
being straining towards him - there’s a great hiss of
steam, a howling hoot - and the train disappears from view.
Aunt Belle finds her through the crowd AUNT BELLE
Poor child!
And we LIFT UP, to take in the length of the platform and
its sudden absence of men - only women are dotted along it,
frozen like statues in their emotion; wives, sisters,
fiancees, mothers...
...As a strange, deathly silence falls over them all.
73

EXT. LANE, OXFORD - EVENING

73

Later that day. A pale, shaken Vera is walking down an Oxford
lane, back towards her college, when she hears a voice behind
her.
Vera!

VICTOR

She turns to see Victor...

VERA

He’s striding towards her, concern on his kind face.
VICTOR
Roland asked me to come. He thought
you’d need a friendly face.
Thank you.

VERA

Vera suddenly feels her emotions, her exhaustion. Victor
sees, gestures to a nearby bench, they sit together.
VERA
What a mess...
Victor sighs, nods in agreement.
VERA (CONT’D)
I can’t stay here, not now.
VICTOR
What would you do?

Salmon Revision 21.04.14

VERA
I don’t know...nurse? There’s a
call for volunteers.
Vera shrugs, they smile.....He wants to find the right words
for her.

VICTOR
Roland won’t die young, Vera. He
was born to make his mark on the
world.
Vera’s face - eager to believe.
VERA
Do you think?
VICTOR
I’m sure of it.
She smiles - grateful VERA CONT.
Thank you for being here. (A beat)
I’m sorry if you were hurt Victor VICTOR
(interrupting)
No, please, it’s fine.
VERA
But I feel I VICTOR
There’s no need. In fact I’ve - met
a girl.
VERA
That’s wonderful, I’m happy for
you! What’s her name?
VICTOR
Molly. She’s keen.
VERA
And she has you here with her.
She’s a luckier girl than I am,
then.
She puts her hand on his, squeezes it with a smile.
74

EXT. PORTER’S LODGE, SOMERVILLE - DAY

74

A new day. Vera emerges from the porter’s lodge to see a boy
of about 13 riding a red bicycle. He sees her, cycles over,
scrabbles inside his satchel and pulls out a telegram.
BOY ON BICYCLE
Telegram, from the War Office.
Vera takes it, reads the name.

Salmon Revision 21.04.14

51

VERA
(dismay)
Miss Lorimer...
She holds it out to him, but he resists taking it back.
BOY ON BICYCLE
Would you, Miss...?
Vera hesitates, looks at the telegram in her hand.
BOY ON BICYCLE
Thanks Miss! I hate it when they
cry!
And with that, he turns and cycles off.
75

EXT. QUAD, ORIEL - A LITTLE LATER

75

Vera is waiting as Miss Lorimer emerges from a doorway,
behind a few chattering students.
She sees Vera looking at her, and hesitates, sensing
something. Vera steps over and hands her the envelope. Miss
Lorimer tears it open - reads quickly, and staggers.
Vera supports her arm, and helps her to the curved dip in a
stone arch. Miss Lorimer sits, stiff, stricken.
CLOSE ON Vera’s face....
76

EXT. BROAD STREET, OXFORD - DAY (AUTUMN)

76

Vera, on her way to a lecture, passes a news stand. A chalked
headline catches her eye: ”Heavy Casualties in Neuve
Chapelle.” Small groups of women are already congregated,
anxiously reading newspapers. Vera buys one.
She opens the paper, inside is a column of “Fallen in
Combat”. Vera looks down the column. It continues over the
page. She turns over; sees an entire double spread, with
column after column of men’s names in tiny print. Reeling,
she sits on a vacant bench, and turns over - another double
spread. Hundreds of them - all dead.

IN VERA’S MIND - SHE SEES -

Roland, in pouring rain, hunkered down in a muddy trench with
other men, under heavy shell fire - he turns and looks
straight at her A whistle goes, he turns to mount the trench -

77A

Vera is standing before an astonished Miss Lorimer.
MISS LORIMER
Nursing?! What on earth for?
VERA
They need volunteers.
MISS LORIMER
And I’m sure there are lots of
eager young women out there who
haven’t embarked on promising
careers at Oxford!
VERA
I need to do something, I can’t
stay here buried in books, not now!
MISS LORIMER
You don’t own the truth about how
to get through this, Miss Brittain!
Your opinion is just that - an
opinion. You’d do well to remember
it.
VERA
(chastened)
I’m sorry...I didn’t mean...
MISS LORIMER
This crisis needs people who can
stand back and reflect. How can you
think of giving up a golden
opportunity you’ve worked so hard
for?
Vera looks down, says nothing.
MISS LORIMER (CONT’D)
So your mind’s quite made up.
A pause - Then VERA
(shaken)
Yes, it is.
Miss Lorimer turns away from her. Vera realises she’s
dismissed.
VERA (CONT’D)
Thank you, for.....

She peters out, and heads for the door. Throws Miss Lorimer
one last look, but she still has her back turned.
ON Miss Lorimer - the upset showing on her face.
79

INT. CORRIDOR, 1ST LONDON GENERAL HOSPITAL - DAY (AUTUMN) 79
Vera, dressed in the floor-length uniform of the VAD nurse,
walks down a long, draughty corridor in the 1st London
General, a Victorian construct in Camberwell. Her footsteps
clip-clop on the floor.

She cuts a resolute figure, but it’s an image of isolation of a person dwarfed by bigger events.

Vera stands in a row of freshly scrubbed, eager VADs, as a
stern career Sister in her 60’s, JONES, inspects them.
SISTER JONES V.O.
I know what visions have brought
you here, and I’m happy they
carried you to our door, but that’s
where you leave them. You’re not
Angels of Mercy swooping down to
mop the brows of grateful men;
you’re workers! And you’ll do
whatever you’re asked, no matter
how dirty, no matter how dull. Do I
make myself clear?
VADS TOGETHER
Yes Sister.
Sister Jones’ steely gaze lands on Vera, she stops before
her.
Hands.

SISTER JONES

Vera holds out her hands. Sister Jones examines them, sees
they’re smooth, white, spotless - a small sneer. She drops
them, walks on.
SISTER JONES
Airs and graces will not be
tolerated, especially from those
who’ve come down from an ivory
tower. If you’ve any doubts, the
door’s there, you can leave now.
Silence. No one moves. Sister Jones gazes sternly at them.

An alarm clock on a bedside unit rings. 5.45 am. Vera,
asleep in a narrow bed in a bare, cold room with five other

She pushes her way through the weary commuters, and manages
to find a seat for herself at the back. She gazes out through
the rain at the dreary grey street outside.
83

INT. WARD, 1ST LONDON GENERAL - LATER THAT DAY
Sister Jones, a surgeon and two nurses are conferring
together as Vera and fellow VADs bustle in. Sister Jones
rounds on them.
SISTER JONES
Who sterilised the instruments?
Behind her sits a tray of silver surgical instruments.
VERA
I did, Sister.
The Sister’s eyes beam in on Vera, who looks tired.
SISTER JONES
And would you say you’ve done a
good job?
Silence - Vera is thrown, but holds her nerve.
VERA
I - think so.
SISTER JONES
You think so. Really.
She reveals a tray of instruments underneath that haven’t
been touched.
SISTER JONES
What about these?
VERA
(shame)
I forgot SISTER JONES
You forgot. And what if someone had
used them, not realising?!
VERA
I’m sorry SISTER JONES
It’s human lives that could be put
at risk! And I thought you were
supposed to be intelligent.
Vera smarts - but says nothing.

after Vera) We’re waiting!

Vera is hurriedly sterilising the instruments as Nurse
Scott enters - she manages to drop some clattering to the

Vera is sitting on her thin mattress, pulling socks off her
damp feet. They’re swollen and red with painful chill
blains. BETTY, a pale, middle-class Northerner in the bed
next to her, is gazing mournfully at a photo of a soldier.
BETTY
(tearful)
Do you have a photo of yours?
No.

VERA

Betty kisses the photo.
BETTY
Personally I couldn’t get through
the day without seeing his face.
I don’t sleep at night for the
worry.
(dry)
Really.

VERA

BETTY
I’m too sensitive. I wish I was
more like you!

She flings herself across her bed. Vera sighs to herself.

INT. DORMITORY, CAMBERWELL - NIGHT

Vera lies in bed, wide awake, while next to her, Betty
snores loudly in her sleep.
VERA’S VOICE
I hate it sometimes, of course I
do. But then I think of you, out
there in the danger, darkness and
cold - precious life, a thousand
times more tired than I!
She gets a newspaper out from under her bed and reads an
article, frowning to herself. Then she gets up and studies
a map of France on her wall. Drawing pins mark the front
line of battle. Carefully, she repositions a few of them,
as Roland’s voice rises.
ROLAND’S VOICE
(a letter)
"One of my men has just been killed
- the first. I’ve been taking the
things out of his pockets and tying
them in his handkerchief, to be
sent back somewhere, to someone who
will see in them more than a torn
letter, a pencil and a piece of
shell..."
88

INT. WARD, 1ST LONDON GENERAL - LATER

88

Vera hurriedly carries a basin of hot soapy water across
the ward to a curtained-off bed. The other beds in the ward
are dotted with neatly bandaged men, but it’s not full.
Vera enters through the curtains to find Nurse Scott and
another nurse, Miss Milton, working with urgency on an
unconscious man; one is cutting away his ragged, filthy
uniform, the other is completing the dressing to a head
wound. We should suddenly feel the mud and stench of the
trenches.
NURSE MILTON
Fancy sending him over in this
state.
NURSE SCOTT
We’re seeing more and more of it.
Vera watches bits of blood-soaked khaki cloth fall to the
floor. She puts the basin down, arranges some towels. When
she turns round again, the man is suddenly naked; lying
there Christ-like, broken, strangely beautiful.

Salmon Revision 21.04.14

57

Nurse Scott sees her.
NURSE SCOTT
Since you’re so eager, Brittain,
you sponge him down.
The two nurses leave. Vera hesitates, slightly awe-struck by
her task. She squeezes a wet sponge out, and, tentatively,
starts to wash the blood and mud from his chest. His eyelids
flutter.
WOUNDED SOLDIER
(hoarse)
Vera...
Startled, Vera leans in close.
VERA
What did you say?
He opens his eyes wider now, looks at her...

young man of delicate features.
She reaches Edward and hugs him close. He looks at her,
concerned.
EDWARD
You look exhausted, what’re they

She shakes Geoffrey’s hand. He’s shy, can’t make eye
contact with her.
GEOFFREY
No, the relief is all mine.
Vera smiles.
VERA
A peace-loving soldier?
GEOFFREY
Or a cowardly one perhaps.
EDWARD
Nonsense. Geoffrey was about to
train as a priest, that takes
courage.
They both smile.
GEOFFREY
Saved by the War, imagine that.
He glances at Edward, a shy, intense look.
EDWARD

So, shall we go?
Where?

Didn’t he write and tell you?

EXT. BRACKEN FIELD, CLIFF, LOWESTOFT - A LITTLE LATER

91A

Vera approaches Roland, sitting in a bracken field adjacent
to the family house, gazing out across the sea. He hears her,
and turns. He’s still in his dusty officer’s uniform, and he
looks different - worn, somehow, his expression full of
anxiety, and remote.
ROLAND
(as soon as he sees her)
I have to go back in three days.
Vera is shocked - but sits next to him.
VERA
Let’s not think about that.
Roland looks at her almost as though at a stranger Then he sees Edward and Victor approaching. He leaps to his
feet, suddenly more relaxed.
Ted! Vic!

He goes over to them, they all shake hands. Vera hears
Edward introducing Geoffrey to him. She’s confused - this
is not what she expected.

Roland is preparing to throw his army knife at an old wooden
post in the sand, as the others watch. He takes aim, and
throws - bulls eye. The men show their appreciation. Roland
goes and pulls the knife out, a swagger to him.
As he comes back ROLAND
The worst is when you have to go
out and repair the wire. Boot
polish on the face, crawling on
your belly in the mud and rain.

He sits on a dune, the others do the same.

ROLAND (CONT’D)
I was out one night with an officer
called Harrison. We were so close
to the Germans we could hear them
whispering in their trench. Hast du
feuer?
The others chuckle, hanging off his every word.
VICTOR
Were you scared?
ROLAND
You don’t think about it. He’s a
good man, Harrison. I invited him
to stay, but he’s not interested in
home leave. Says it makes a man
soft.
VERA
God forbid any of you should be
soft!
VICTOR
If I could get out there I don’t
think I’d want to come back.
VERA
(sharp)
You don’t know the first thing
about it!
Edward, sensing the mood, claps Victor on the back, indicates
to Geoffrey.
EDWARD
Come on, let’s get some tea.
Vera is left there with Roland, a tense mood between them.
After a moment, Roland decides to head after the others.
Roland!

VERA

He turns to her.
ROLAND
That was unnecessary.
VERA
Talk to me! Otherwise how can I
understand?!
ROLAND
(hard)
Perhaps you can’t.
A pause.

Salmon Revision 21.04.14

61

VERA
I sent you some poems a while ago,
I don’t know if you got them.
ROLAND
I don’t think so.
VERA
Have you written any yourself?
Roland kind of snorts with derision at this idea.
ROLAND
Poems?! Please...
He sees her stricken expression ROLAND
For God’s sake!
He turns and strides away. Vera follows him, her skirts
catching round her ankles. He moves faster, as though
desperate to escape her.
ROLAND!

VERA

She catches up with him, roughly GRABS his arm. He SHAKES her
off so hard, she stumbles and falls. He looks stricken, helps
her to her feet.
ROLAND
I’m sorry - I’m sorry She grabs his hands.
VERA
This isn’t the real you! This -!
She puts his hand to her cheek, then kisses it, then puts it
to her waist, almost forcing him to hold her VERA
This is real! Feel it! Remember,
Roland! You and me together - now here - this moment!
He looks at her, raw, his armour cracking VERA (CONT’D)
The most precious part of you don’t let war destroy it!
ROLAND
It might be gone already VERA
No! It’s not! I promise you!

He PULLS her to him, in a sudden, desperate hug - buries his
face in her shoulder. Vera hugs him back, holding him tight.
94

EXT. ABOVE THE BEACH, GRASSY SLOPE - A LITTLE LATER
Roland and Vera are sitting next to each other. Gulls keen
overhead. The mood is quiet.
ROLAND
Harrison’s brother came back from
leave engaged to his fiancee.
Within ten minutes he’d put his
head above the parapet and got
his brains blown out. I was next
to him when it happened. (Pause)
Home leave makes you soft.
She strokes his hair, his face.
VERA
We don’t need to get married, or
engaged!
Roland looks at her for a beat ROLAND
Perhaps we should.
VERA
It’s not what either of us wanted ROLAND
Imagine it, though. You, in a
beautiful dress. A sunny day, an
old church. All the people we love.
Champagne.
VERA
(gentle smile)
Cake.
He smiles - haunted.
ROLAND (CONT’D)
Does it get any better than cake?
A beat -

ROLAND
Marry me Vera, next time I’m home!
VERA
(emotional)
Alright. Yes!
ROLAND
It’ll give me something to fix on.
He hugs her to him, tight, his eyes burning.
ROLAND
I’m going to live.
A WIDE SHOT of Vera and Roland, two small beings clinging
to one another.
95

EXT. BEACH, LOWESTOFT - DAY

95

Vera and Roland are flying a kite along the beach together,
running with it, as it flutters up and down in the breeze,
laughing.
Vera stops and watches him for a moment - the look of
almost childlike concentration on his face. Carefree, just
for an instant.
VERA’S VOICE
Our generation will never be new
again, or truly young.

As for peace of mind, who knows
when it will return...If it ever

98

INT. CHARING CROSS RAILWAY STATION - DAY
Vera is hugging goodbye to a uniformed Edward, next to the
train he’s about to board for France. The platform is
swarming with men in khaki and family members. Geoffrey is
saying farewell to Mr. And Mrs. Brittain.
Edward pulls some sheafs of paper from his coat, and hands
them to her with a smile.

EDWARD
My music. Keep it for me.
Vera nods, takes it.
Edward steps over to his father, shakes his hand. Then Mr.
Brittain pulls him in for a stiff embrace.
Vera overhears two company commanders walking past COMMANDING OFFICER
I wish they wouldn’t come, it
makes it so much harder for the
men.
The train whistle blows. Geoffrey and Edward bound onto the
train with a final, cheerful wave. Vera and her parents
watch, stricken.
99

INT. PLATFORM, CHARING CROSS STATION - A LITTLE LATER

99

Vera and her mother are about to enter the station cafe
when Mrs. Brittain looks around for her husband. She sees
him further along the platform, his back to them, seemingly
studying a timetable.
MRS. BRITTAIN
Go and tell your father to hurry
up, dear, will you.
Vera walks over towards her father, who is oddly immobile.
VERA
(approaching)
Daddy?
She reaches him, realises he’s battling to hold down his
emotions. She puts a hand on his shoulder.
Oh Daddy.

VERA

His shoulders start to shake - small, silent judders. She
gets out a handkerchief, hands it to him, he puts it over
his face.
100

INT. CORRIDOR, 1ST LONDON GENERAL - EARLY MORNING
Ward Sister Jones is holding the door open as nurses push
trolleys piled high with laundered bed linen through. The
mood is urgent.
SISTER JONES

Vera, Betty and a few other girls come rushing along the

SISTER JONES

lunchtime! Hurry now!
101

INT. CORRIDOR, 1ST LONDON GENERAL - LATER

101

A white sheet flutters up - and down onto a military bed.
Vera and Betty tuck the sheet in, as around them, other
nurses make up beds, and orderlies busily erect new ones.
They finish, and stand back - as we PULL OUT to realise
they’re in the long hospital corridor, now filled wall to
wall with newly prepared beds, with barely an inch between
them.
What now?
We wait.

EXT. STREET, 1ST LONDON GENERAL - LATER

Vera and Betty emerge from the hospital to see a gaggle of
nurses outside, standing still and listening. They join
them.
VERA
What is it-?
One of the other nurses holds her hand up for quiet. They
listen.
A distant, muffled BOOM resonates. Vera looks down at her
sensible lace-up shoes. The pavement beneath her feet is
shuddering.
Betty looks at her in disbelief.
BETTY
It can’t be...
Another boom resonates, the pavement shakes.
VERA
It’s France.

INT. WARD, 1ST LONDON GENERAL - DAY

66
103

A scene of barely contained chaos. Vera and Betty balance
medical trays as they squeeze their way between the tightlypacked beds, which are now crammed full of groaning,
wounded men. Blaring, jaunty gramophone music goes some
way to drowning the cries.
104

INT. ANNEXE - LATER

104

Vera is arranging surgical instruments on trays at one end
of the annexe.
Brittain!

SISTER JONES

Vera whips round. The Ward Sister’s beady eye sweeps across
the trays - then an exhausted Vera.
SISTER JONES
Good work, Nurse. Make sure you
get your rest.
Vera nods, pleased - some praise, at last.
105

EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY

105

Vera is walking along a street in the city of London, past
a wall covered in propaganda posters.
VERA’S VOICE
There’s news of Geoffrey, Roland.
Edward’s asked me to go and see
him.
One poster, repeated over and over, shows a man sitting in
an armchair with a little boy on his lap, and the caption:
“Daddy, what did YOU do in the War?”
106

INT. FISHMONGER HALL - LATER

106

Vera is sitting next to Geoffrey, in a cramped little space
partitioned off from other invalids in the huge, vaulted
hall.
Geoffrey has changed, and it’s shocking. He’s seated in a
chair, next to a bed, a blanket over his knees. His face is
grey, his expression haunted, and he’s shaking.
VERA
Can I get you anything?
Edward...?

GEOFFREY

Salmon Revision 21.04.14
She knows what he’s asking.
VERA
We had a letter yesterday, he’s
well.
A pause. Geoffrey’s mind wanders.
GEOFFREY
It’s the way the men watch your
every move, as though you have the
answers, as though you have a
clue...
He stops, breathless, almost choking.

GEOFFREY
When we went over the top...I held
it together for them.
VERA
You’re very brave.
She tries to take his hand but he pulls it away, unable to
bear human contact.
GEOFFREY
I need to get back there.
This baffles Vera.
...Why?

VERA

GEOFFREY
The fear of going’s the worst.
(Pause) Nothing will be better
until it’s over.
107

INT. CORRIDOR, FISHMONGER HALL - ANOTHER DAY

107

Vera is helping Geoffrey to walk - he has the strange,
flailing walk of the shell-shocked; a toddler’s stagger in
the body of an old man.
VERA’S VOICE
He was at the front just eleven
days. It’s taken three months for
him to even start to walk again.
108

INT. WARD, 1ST LONDON GENERAL - EVENING

108

Vera is on night duty in the dark, quiet ward. Her duties
finished, she sits down and eagerly pulls out a letter from
Roland. She starts to read.
ROLAND’S VOICE
Good news. My Christmas leave has
been approved. I’ll be home to
make you my wife!
Vera is delighted.
ROLAND’S VOICE (CONT’D)
And I have a surprise, something
I think will please you.

INT. WARD, 1ST LONDON GENERAL - EVENING (WINTER)

109

Vera and other nurses move between beds of sleeping men,
hanging up Christmas decorations - tinsel and some holly.
As she’s next to one bed - the occupant, Billy, calls out.
Nurse!

BILLY

Vera turns to look at the man, his expression warm.
BILLY
You’re walking on air, Nurse!
Vera smiles.
BILLY
Go on, spill the beans.
Vera hesitates, then decides to tell him.
VERA
I’m going to Brighton in the
morning to meet my fiance, we’re
getting married.
BILLY
Over there, is he, fighting the
Boch?
She nods.
BILLY
Now you’re a reason for a man to
get through, Miss, if you don’t
mind my saying.
She tucks him up with a smile.

Settle down and get some sleep.

1915, WINTER)

110

An excited Vera is fixing a hat on, in a large gilt mirror
in a corner of the elegant, high-ceilinged lobby. Her
mother is with her, helping. Around them, we get a sense of
the coming and going of guests, and smart, uniformed staff.
Muffled, discreet elegance. A phone is ringing somewhere.
VERA
How do I look?
MRS. BRITTAIN
(adjusting her)
Positively bridal.
Vera glances at a clock.
VERA (CONT’D)
Half an hour to go. He’ll have
had a long journey, he’ll be
tired.
A HOTEL CLERK in black comes over.
HOTEL CLERK
Miss Vera Brittain?
Yes.

VERA

HOTEL CLERK
A telephone call for you, Miss.
VERA
(surprised)
That must be him! I hope he’s not
going to be late.
She follows the clerk over to a desk, where apricot pink
flowers sit a blue glass vase. Her mother watches, with a
trace of anxiety.
ON Vera’s hand as, in slight slow motion, she reaches for
the receiver. She lifts it to her ear.
Hello?

VERA

The line is fuzzy, but no one replies the other end.
...Roland?

VERA

She hears a sob - someone is crying. Anxiety floods her.

MRS. LEIGHTON’S VOICE
(choking sobs)
Vera...Oh God Vera...Oh God...
Vera’s blood starts to turn to ice. All other sound cuts
out - just the throbbing pulse of her heart.
Around her, the lobby FREEZES - people stopped in their
tracks, the hotel clerk, her Mother - The world at a standstill.
MRS. LEIGHTON’S VOICE
(choking sobs)
He’s dead...Roland’s dead.
Vera’s EYES - staring at a silent, frozen world. A breeze
tinkles the ceiling chandelier - then ruffles the flowers
in the blue vase, their colour so dazzling bright, it hurts
the eyes.

INT. SITTING ROOM, LEIGHTON HOUSE, LOWESTOFT - DAY(WINTER)113
Vera sits, straight and still, on a couch. Mrs. Leighton is
nearby, red-eyed, lost in her own world. Roland’s younger
sister Clare, 15, is there. So is Victor, now in uniform.
Grief isolates them all.
Mr. Leighton stands before them, reading from a letter.
MR. LEIGHTON
It’s from an officer in his
company. (Reading)...died of
wounds at Louvencourt clearing
station.
VERA
What was he doing at the front?
Mr. Leighton looks at her blankly - in shock.
MRS. LEIGHTON
Why was he in a trench?
Mr. Leighton scans the letter.
MR. LEIGHTON
Suddenly sent there by all
accounts, for a big push.
VICTOR
There was nothing in the papers.
MR. LEIGHTON
Never happened. False alarm. He
was out mending wire.(Scanning
the letter) Shot by a sniper at 2
am while bravely carrying out
duties. Taken straight to
Louvencourt, died late
afternoon...noble and painless
death.
VERA
That’s a long time after he was
shot! What happened?
Mrs. Leighton, agitated, gets up; none of them want to
think about this.
MR. LEIGHTON
Painless...I suppose the man
would know.
Mrs. Leighton goes over to a record collection, pulls out a
gramophone record.
MRS. LEIGHTON
He loved this piece....

Salmon Revision 21.04.14

She turns away, close to tears. Vera feels someone taking her
hand - looks down. It’s Clare, smiling at her through tears,
reaching out. Vera gives her hand a quick squeeze, but she
can’t respond to the emotion...
114

EXT. GARDEN, LEIGHTON HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER
Vera is standing there, in a bleak wind, as Victor comes
out and joins her. After a moment VICTOR
I’m off to France in a few days.
VERA
Oh Victor...
VICTOR
(trying to keep it
light)
Yes, funnily enough the eyesight
doesn’t seem to be such a problem
anymore.

good at that...living to the
full.
Vera manages a smile - nods.
VICTOR (CONT’D)

important to hold onto.
VERA
(detached)
He had nearly a whole day after
he was shot. Why was there no
message for us?

paper.

Frustrated, she screws the letter up into a ball, chucks it
away, then picks up a pen, and starts intently writing.

Vera notices Betty and two VADs. They’re looking at her,
obviously wanting to say something. Vera turns impatiently
away - she has no interest in hearing it Vera -

BETTY

Vera turns. Her closed expression is not encouraging.
VAD 2
We’re sorry for your loss.
VAD 1
He’s in a better place now.
VERA

I doubt he’d agree with that.

INT. CONVALESCENT SUN ROOM, LONDON - CONTINUOUS

118

She enters a large, light-drenched sun room dotted with
recovering soldiers. She enquires of one of them, he points
to a young man in convalescent blues - GEORGE - at the far
end, one arm in a sling. As Vera approaches, she takes in a
tall, slim young man with an attractive face - nothing much
of the soldier about him. A Nurse is helping him to his
feet.
VERA
Excuse me I’m Vera Brittain,
fiancee to Roland Leighton George realises who she is - his expression closes, with
gentle weariness.
CONVALESCENT NURSE
The officer’s not receiving
visitors today.
GEORGE
(a gesture to the nurse)
I did write to you, Miss BrittainVERA
Yes, thank you, and I’m sorry to
bother you again, it’s just GEORGE
(interrupting, gentle)
There’s really nothing more I can
say.
VERA
But you - you did see Roland at
the clearing station that day George starts limping painfully away, propped up by the
nurse, who tut-tuts disapprovingly at Vera.
GEORGE
Comfort yourself that it was a
quick and painless end.
VERA
Everyone keeps saying that, but
Roland lived for hours after he
was shot!
George didn’t know she knew this.
GEORGE
(closing it down)
I’m sorry for your loss.
He keeps walking. Vera hesitates - then pursues him.

Salmon Revision 21.04.14

75

VERA
I understand. You’re afraid I’ll
make a scene. You think I’ll throw
myself around like some hysteric.
And why should you be the messenger
of some terrible end? You’ve never
even met me!
He turns to look at her - she sees the hesitation on his
face.
VERA (CONT’D)
I need to know the truth. It’s the
one thing left I can do for him.
A beat. George gestures to the nurse, who leaves them. Vera
waits.
GEORGE
Would you like to sit down?
I’m fine.

VERA

George clears his throat. This is difficult.
GEORGE
It was a messy wound, low down in
the abdomen. They operated, they
did their best. I was in the bed
next to him. He didn’t stand a
chance.
Vera looks straight at him the whole time.
GEORGE (CONT’D)
He came round for a few hours.
VERA
Did he say anything? Was there a
message?
GEORGE
(gentle with her)
The pain was too great, Miss
Brittain. It made anything else
impossible.
Vera remains steady.
VERA
I see. Yes, that would explain it.
(Pause) Did he - suffer a great
deal?
George just looks at her - then nods.

Salmon Revision 21.04.14

76

Vera closes her eyes for a brief moment, struggling to deal
with this.
GEORGE
They’re short of everything in the
clearing stations, it’s chaos, not
enough medics for the number of
wounded. They were waiting for
morphine stocks.
VERA
Did some arrive?
GEORGE
He got a dose near the end.
Vera’s relieved to hear this.
VERA
Were there - any words? Anything?
George is silent.
Please...

VERA

GEORGE
He said - Lying on this hillside
for six days has made me very
stiff.
Vera looks at him - then down, defeated by this.
GEORGE
I’m sorry. None of it makes any
sense.
Vera holds out a hand.
VERA
You’re very kind. I won’t forget
it.
George takes her hand, presses it between his; suddenly drawn
to that strength and resolve of hers.
Vera turns and walks away. He watches her go.

Vera is heading up the snowy garden path when Roland’s

Clare runs back into the house. Vera hesitates, not sure if
she can face this.
122

INT. LIVING ROOM, LEIGHTON HOUSE - SECONDS LATER

122

Vera walks into the living room to be met by a terrible
sight. Mr. and Mrs. Leighton are standing frozen in horror,
looking at a heap of blood and mud-stained khaki clothes in
the centre of the room. The smell is terrible - Vera covers
her nose and mouth with her hand.
MRS. LEIGHTON
How could they do this?! How
could they send us that....that,
it’s not my Roland!
Mrs. Leighton turns away from the horrible sight.
MRS. LEIGHTON
Take it outside, take it!
Mr. Leighton steps forward, but Vera stops him.
Wait.

VERA

She goes over to the bloody heap, stares at it for a
moment. Then kneels down beside it. She has to brace
herself to breathe normally, because of the smell.
Oh God....

VERA

Salmon Revision 21.04.14

78

She reaches across, picks up a damp, blood-soaked item Roland’s vest, ripped and torn.
She picks up his cap, all flattened and squashed. Next, his
jacket, covered in dried viscera. Vera holds it up. She has
to look, she has to check....Bracing herself, she reaches
into the inside pocket. The filth of the trenches comes off
on her hands, but she carries on. She feels something pulls out Roland’s wallet. Her fingers are trembling, but
she opens it. Inside, is a photo of her. Vera wipes hair
from her face, gets a streak of dirt across it. She feels
something else, reaches in and pulls out - a sheaf of
papers.
Vera lays them down. They’re splattered, filthy, but she
smooths them out. They’re poems, headed “For Vera”. One has
dried violet flowers folded into it.
Vera gazes at them - overcome, her emotions rising to the
surface; sobs of grief and joy combined. At last something from him. At last, she can grieve...
123

EXT. GARDEN, LEIGHTON HOUSE - LATER

Vera and Mr. Leighton are digging a hole in the frozen
ground, as Mrs. Leighton watches, Clare pours boiling water
from a kettle to help thaw the soil. Over this:

Violets from Plug Street Wood,
Sweet, I send you oversea.
Vera and Mr. Leighton shovel Roland’s kit into the hole. Then
they start to bury it.

We see Roland as he spots some violets growing beneath a

growing in the blood-stained earth around his head. A bird
twitters somewhere, leaves rustle in the breeze.

VICTOR
This blanket’s driving me mad,
it’s far too itchy!
VERA
I’ll take care of it.
Upset, she takes the blanket off, then sits back down,
trying to keep her voice steady.

VERA
Does Molly know? Would you like
me to contact her for you?
A beat.
VICTOR
There’s no Molly, Vera. There
never was.
On Vera - stricken.
VICTOR (CONT’D)
(managing a smile)
Couldn’t have you feeling sorry
for me, could I?
127

INT. DORMITORY, 1ST LONDON GENERAL - DAY

127

A thoughtful Vera is getting ready to go out - coat and hat
on. She checks her appearance in the mirror - gazes at her
face for a moment, gaunt, worn. Then she goes over to a box
of cakes, closes it carefully up, and readies to leave.
128

EXT. GARDEN, 1ST LONDON GENERAL - A LITTLE LATER
Vera is settling herself down in a chair next to Victor,
who has been brought outside to get some fresh air. The
opened box of cakes is beside him.
VICTOR
I’m getting a visit from an
officer who lost both eyes at the
start of the War. He’s going to
tell me about Braille.
VERA
That’s the Victor I know, always
the optimist.
VICTOR
(A new cynicism)
Yes, inspirational stories for
the damned. What about you? Still
writing?
VERA
Writing! Goodness no.
VICTOR
Really? You’ve got some material
now.

128

Salmon Revision 21.04.14

81

VERA
That belongs to another life. I
have much more important things
to interest me, like being here
with you.
Victor gropes for her hand, she takes it. He gives it a
squeeze.
VERA (CONT’D)
I’ve been thinking, Victor, and I
want to look after you. We belong
together now, don’t we? You’re
going to need someone, and I Victor listens, alert and very still.
VERA (CONT’D)
(swallowing)
- well, Roland would like it. You
knew him better than anyone in
the world, except Edward.
VICTOR
Poor Vera. Are you proposing to
me now?
VERA
Yes, yes I am.
Victor lifts her hand to his lips and kisses it.
VICTOR
(gently)
Then I must turn you down.
A moment - as Vera accepts, gradually realising he’s right.
They sit there, lost together, holding hands.
129

INT. DORMITORY, CAMBERWELL - NIGHT

129

Vera is fast asleep in her narrow bed when there’s a sudden
pounding at the door. Vera and Betty both sit up with a
start.
VOICE OUTSIDE
Brittain! You’re wanted!
130

INT. BIG WARD, 1ST LONDON GENERAL - DAWN
Vera hurries into the ward, looking for Victor. She sees
his bed has been curtained off. A Nurse - SISTER ELIOT sees her and steps over.

130

Salmon Revision 21.04.14

82

SISTER ELIOT
He called for us about an hour
ago, said there was a loud
clicking noise in his head.
Vera pulls back the curtain - sees Victor lying in bed,
dead.
SISTER ELIOT
It was very quick. I’m sorry.
Vera nods, sinks into a chair by the bed. Sister Eliot
pulls the curtain closed and leaves her. Victor’s peaceful
in death, his hands folded across his chest, that shrunken,
child-like look accentuated.
Vera gazes at him....
131

EXT. TRENCH, FRANCE - DAY

131

The hollow FACES of young tommies, standing in a trench,
waiting silently to go over the top.
One smokes, another nervously bites his lip, another’s gaze
is vacant...we come to Edward, his hair greying at the
temples - remembering he’s still only 20 - the truth of War
etched on his face.
EDWARD’S VOICE
I’m so glad you were near, and saw
him so nearly at the end. We share
a memory of both of them, dear
Vera, that is worth all the rest of
the world, and the sun of that
memory never sets. And you know
that I love you, that I would do
anything in the world in my power
should you ask it, and that I am
your servant as well as your
brother. (Pause) Edward.
132

INT. LIVING ROOM, MELROSE - DAY (WINTER)
Vera, composed and pale, sits opposite her parents.
VERA
My mind’s made up.
MRS. BRITTAIN
But France, the front, it’s so
dangerous!
VERA
I’ll be behind the lines. It’s as
close to Edward as I can get, I need to be there.

132

Salmon Revision 21.04.14

83

Mrs. Brittain, agitated, gets up and fetches some gifts jars of jam and cream, some rollers.
MRS. BRITTAIN
I’ve been gathering some things
for you, I suppose you can take
them to France too. There’s so
little available now, but - cook’s
last jar...
She puts down some jam.
Damson.

MRS. BRITTAIN

Vera sighs, exasperated.
As Mrs. Brittain moves off again, Mr Brittain touches Vera’s
hand - his expression asking for her understanding....
Mrs. Brittain comes back with more things.
MRS. BRITTAIN
Some rollers for your hair...and
cream. It’ll help stop your hands
chapping. And don’t forget those
poor elbows, it’s easily done.
A beat. Vera reaches out, takes her mother’s hand.
VERA
I’ll make sure I use it. And I’ll
write every day, I promise.
Mrs Brittain nods, trying to be alright. Mr. Brittain’s eyes
glimmer with admiration for her.

Salmon Revision 21.04.14

84

MR. BRITTAIN
Why was I ever disappointed you
weren’t a boy?
They share a smile.
133

INT. ARMY LORRY, ETAPLES MILITARY BASE, FRANCE - DAY

133

Vera, in her VAD uniform, sits in a crowded army lorry as
it pulls into Etaples military base. It’s raining outside.
Through the window, she sees wounded men on stretchers
carried past, army personnel and nurses hurrying along, red
cross vehicles rumbling by. Some Chinese labourers are
building a new hut, shouting to each other in Chinese. Her
fellow passengers, all army personnel, leap up and bustle
out.
Vera gets to her feet, takes hold of her suitcase and
climbs out. Her feet immediately sink into the MUD of
Norther France. From somewhere comes the distant sound of
song. It’s soldiers singing: “Good bye-eee, Don’t Cry-eee,
Wipe the tear, Baby dear, from your eye-eee...”
As the army lorry departs, the sight that greets her is
deslotate - mud, rain, and a warren of makeshift wood and tin
huts.
134

EXT. ETAPLES - SECONDS LATER

134

A wet Vera enters a small courtyard of huts, her feet
sinking into a quagmire of mud.
Then she sees him - outside one of the huts, a shellshocked
Tommy, wrapped in an old army blanket, standing there
shivering and soaked. The look in his eyes cuts right through
her. Two nurses emerge to encourage him back inside, but he
seems not to hear them.
Vera sees a young VAD, Dorothy, pass, and approaches her,
showing her a piece of paper.
VERA
Excuse me, I’m to report to C
section.
Dorothy looks at the paper, points.
DOROTHY
That hut there. (grimace) You’re
under Sister Milroy - good luck.
And with that, she’s gone.

Salmon Revision 21.04.14
135

EXT. HUTS, ETAPLES MILITARY BASE - LATER

84A
135

Vera, now drenched with rain, has found Hope Milroy and is
following her as she strides along between huts. Young,
vivacious, Hope has a clipped manner and a reputation as an
eccentric.

Salmon Revision 21.04.14

85

HOPE
There’s about thirty men to a
hut, some of them are an absolute
mess She turns to Vera with a bright smile, opens the door to a
tin hut.
HOPE (CONT’D)
They’re supposed to pass through
the clearing stations, but that’s
not saying much anymore.
She steps aside to allow Vera to enter.
136

INT. GERMAN HUT, ETAPLES BASE - CONTINUOUS

136

Vera walks in to discover a hut crammed full of thirty men.
Some groan with pain, others are unconscious. Their wounds
are visibly dreadful.
Hope leads Vera through them, talking in a loud voice. A
few of the soldiers follow them with large, expressive
eyes. Hope gestures to a door at the far end.
HOPE (CONT’D)
The theatre’s through there.
We’re short on everything,
including surgeons.
She steps over to one patient, who is unconscious, with a
bandaged arm stump.
HOPE (CONT’D)
Had to saw this chappie’s arm off
myself yesterday, quite a job.
Vera looks horrified.
HOPE (CONT’D)
Not ideal, of course, but then (beaming) this is War.
A voice calls out.
WOUNDED SOLDIER
Schwester! Wasser, wasser bitte!
Vera spins round, startled. The man, very sick and weak, is
looking at them. Vera’s face - as she realises her patients
are Germans. Hope sees.
HOPE
Oh, didn’t I mention? This lot
are Huns. I find it best to
number them, myself, much
quicker.

First Hun, second, third, fourth.
Ah, (lowering her voice) keep an
eye on fourth, he’s only got a
few hours left.
Vera’s reeling.
out.

‘Fourth’ is the wounded soldier who cried

WOUNDED SOLDIER
Ich sterbe! Hasst du kein hertz?
HOPE
Well, that’s it. Best to get stuck
in right away, I find.
VERA
(sudden panic)
I - do I have to? What about the
British huts?
HOPE
(oblivious smile)
You’ve been in charge of your own
ward before, I take it?
No, never!

VERA

HOPE
Lovely! Over to you, then. (a
passing nod to how wet Vera is)
Plenty of time to change later.
And with that, she heads for the door. As she passes the
wounded soldier’s bed HOPE
(to Vera)
See to him, will you. No idea
what he’s on about.
Vera is left standing there, stunned.
VERA
He says you’re heartless.
137

INT. GERMAN WARD - LATER

137

A sweating Vera is dealing with the dressing on a soldier’s
back wound. She lifts the blood-stained gauze to reveal a
raw mass of pus and blood. A moment’s shock.
Then - she goes to a nearby work top. The only equipment is
a pair of grubby forceps in a cracked jar. Soldiers cry out
for her help. Vera looks around her, overwhelmed, trying
not to panic.

Salmon Revision 21.04.14
138

87

EXT. DISPENSING STATION - ETAPLES

138

A queue of nurses wait to collect medical supplies from two
orderlies manning the dispensing station. Vera, at the head
of the queue, hurries away with her arms full of lint,
bandage, medicines and antiseptic.
139

INT. GERMAN WARD - LATER

139

Vera has a bottle of antiseptic, but is looking around for
a jar to use. There’s nothing.
A CORNER OF THE WARD - Vera is rummaging through her
suitcase. She pulls out the jar of cream her mother gave
her.
BACK AT THE WORK TOP - Vera is washing the jar free of all
the cream. Quickly, she pours antiseptic into it, shoves in
instruments for sterilisation.
140

INT. GERMAN WARD - DAY

140

Vera is dressing a leg wound on a German soldier. On the
hut floor, lie piles of dressings saturated with blood and
pus. As she finishes, her eyes meet his - his look of
intense gratitude moves her. Vera smiles and nods in
acknowledgement.
VERA’S VOICE
Here I am, dear Edward, fighting
with every inch of strength to
save men who, fifty or so miles
away, you’re risking your life to
kill. It makes you wonder,
Edward, really it does.
141

EXT. HILL, ETAPLES BASE - DAY (SPRING)
Vera is standing at the top of the gentle slope above the
base - below her, the vast stretch of huts that makes up
Etaples base, cut through by the railway line. She’s been
here a while.
VERA’S VOICE
I waited for you again on Sunday.
I’ll be here every week, until you
can come.
A figure walks towards her, waving - Hope.
HOPE
(as she approaches)
Miss Brittain! You’ll get
sunburn!

141

Salmon Revision 21.04.14

88

Vera says nothing, Hope can see she’s upset.
HOPE (CONT’D)
Another no-show?
Vera nods.
HOPE (CONT’D)
He’ll get here when he can, I’m
sure. Come on, let’s walk.
VERA
I need to rest.
HOPE
Nonsense. Best thing for nervous
upset is exercise.
She’s already striding off.
VERA
(calling)
I’m not upset!
HOPE
(calling)
Chop chop!
Vera sighs, follows her.
142

EXT. WOODS, ETAPLES - LATER

142

Hope and Vera are walking together through beautiful, sundappled woods. Quite a way ahead of them, a limping officer
and a VAD are walking, a self-conscious distance between
them.
HOPE
Look at those two. All the signs
are there. Give them a few
minutes and they’ll be in the
bushes. Not my preferred
location, the flora and fauna
round here are prickly as hell.
Vera looks at her in surprise.
HOPE (CONT’D)
Do I shock you, Nurse?
Vera smiles, shakes her head.
VERA
I don’t think there’s going to be
much room left for etiquette when
all this is over.

Salmon Revision 21.04.14

89

HOPE
Won’t life be dreadfully dull,
though? (Seeing something) Ah,
there we go.
She gestures to where the couple were a minute ago.
HOPE (CONT’D)
You see? Gone.
Hope runs on, calling out.
HOPE
Here little bunnies! Where are you?
Come on out, Mummy won’t be cross!
Bunniekins!
A rustle in the undergrowth - they catch sight of two figures
scampering off through the trees, the man with his trousers
down throws her a dirty look. Vera laughs. Hope grins,
enjoying her prank.
142A

EXT. WOODS, ETAPLES - A LITTLE LATER

142A

Vera and Hope walk, enjoying the fresh air.
VERA
(hesitant, a confession)
You know, some of the time here I’m
actually happy HOPE
‘Course you are, you’re addicted to
it, Brittain, just like the rest of
us. It’s what happens when it’s
over that’s the real worry.
Vera looks at Hope - whose face is flooded with sudden
unspoken pain.
HOPE (CONT’D)
All that mopping up to be done ghastly.
But she battens down the hatches, grabs Vera’s arm.
HOPE
Come on, race you back!
They run off, laughing.
143

INT. GERMAN WARD - DAY
Bloody chaos. About 15 freshly wounded men have been
brought in, in a critical state.

143

90

Vera, Hope and another VAD are desperately trying to cope,
rushing between the beds, as orderlies bring more men in on
stretchers.
Hope passes the bed of a man whose arm is turning black.
HOPE
Gangrene. Brittain, get some
powder on this filthy Hun!
Vera throws Hope a look at this language, scurries over
with a powder bottle, shakes it on the man’s arm. He’s
whimpering with fear.
143A

INT. GERMAN WARD - LATER

143A

Hope is by the bed of a uniformed officer who’s bleeding
profusely from the neck. Vera comes over to her side. Hope
is trying to stem the bleed.
She sees Vera, pulls her briefly aside.
HOPE
It’s hopeless. Get the screen.
Hope stays with the man, who grabs her hand tight.
DYING OFFICER
Lieber Gott...Nicht so!
HOPE
Alright old boy...alright...
DYING OFFICER
(raw fear)
Nicht so! Nicht hier!
His eyes suddenly lose focus, a look of panic comes over
him. Vera is pulling a screen on wheels round the bed.
DYING OFFICER
Meine augen! Ich sehe nichts!
He lashes out, flailing. Hope struggles to hold him down.
Vera comes over to help, it takes both of them.
HOPE
Calm down old chap DYING OFFICER
(total panic)
Hilf mir!
Vera suddenly grips his hand, leans in close.
VERA
Sei still! Alles in ordnung.

Salmon Revision 21.04.14

91

Hope looks at her in surprise. Hearing his own language
makes him stop and listen - Vera smooths his brow. He
calms, starts to whimper like a frightened child, delirium
fast engulfing him.
DYING OFFICER
Klara...? Klara, bist du’s?
A pause.
VERA
Ja...ja, ich bin da.
He calms right down, grips her hand tightly.
VERA
(a whisper)
Keine angst haben...
DYING OFFICER
Verzeihe mir Klara...verzeihe
mir...
Vera can’t hold back the tears, She leans in and kisses him
on the forehead.
Naturlich.

VERA

Hope has tears in her eyes too.
Vera watches the life leave him. Then focuses on the hand
gripping hers, as it slackens....
Silence. She closes his eyes.
A noise rouses her - Hope is opening a small window above
the man’s head.
HOPE
To let his soul escape.
Vera looks up, sees a tree branch right outside - she hears
the peaceful twitter of a bird.
She freezes, then starts to shake - the utter, pointless
horror of it pushing her close to the edge...
Hope sees. She comes over. Bends down, takes her hands,
looks her straight in the eye.
HOPE
(calm, firm)
Control your mind. It’s the only
way.
Vera nods, trying, trembling.

Salmon Revision 21.04.14

92

HOPE
Deep breaths. With me, come on.
They breathe deeply together.
HOPE
In...out....that’s it.
Vera gradually calms. Hope sees this, pats her hands.
Good girl.

HOPE

A gesture that says - time to get on.
VERA
(nodding, getting to her
feet)
I’m fine now. Thank you.

uniforms, sees something moving across them. She looks
closer - a swarm of lice.
2) OUTSIDE GERMAN WARD. Vera dumps the uniforms in an
enormous bin.
3) VERA’S DIGS/WASH AREA. A naked, shivering Vera sits in a
BATH, pumping in a thin stream of hot water. The water runs
out. She has barely an inch to bathe in. She looks at her
fingers - red, puffy, broken-veined - the hands of someone
thirty years older.
VERA’S VOICE
A whole year without seeing you,
dear brother, and yet it feels
like I’ve been in France my whole
life.
4) GERMAN WARD. Vera breaks icicles from the inside of the
window frame 5) OUTSIDE. Vera is hanging sheets on a washing line.
Further along, at the periphery of her vision, sheets flap.
The sun shines, a breeze blows. Suddenly, at this
periphery, barely glimpsed, there’s a KITE And Roland’s hands - strong, brown, alive - his cheek, as
he runs with the kite, his hair - his mouth, smiling She turns. But he’s gone. Just a row of sheets flapping. On

deafening bombardment uncomfortably close. Vera and Hope
move from bed to bed with cups of water or tea, soothing
the men.
HOPE

The Germans are getting closer.
Their faces are tense, but they carry on. The ward is lit up
by flashes of hard, white light from the shell fire - the
strain showing on all the faces.
147

INT./EXT. BRITISH/GERMAN WARDS - DAWN

147

Vera emerges, exhausted, from the British ward, and walks
along a narrow path connecting it to the German ward She opens the door walks right through the German ward to
the other side, emerges to see, a large field Filled to the brim, with row upon row of wounded, dying or
dead men, lying on stretchers or on the bare ground hundreds of them - mud-covered, torn, bloodied men, their
groans and cries echoing.
On Vera - shocked at the sight of so much suffering. More
stretchers are being brought in by orderlies, while the dead
are being carried away.
148

EXT. FIELD OF WOUNDED, ETAPLES - SECONDS LATER

148

Vera walks among the men. Many of them are choking, in the
final stages of gas poisoning, great yellow blisters on
their skin. They’ve come straight from combat. Some of them
look straight at her, their expressions harrowing. Orderly
1 runs up to her.
ORDERLY 1

Vera takes this in. Voices call out, pleading.

A horrible gargling noise rises up from his throat. Vera
turns to him, but she knows there’s nothing she can do.

I’ll get you some water....
Vera hurries over to a water tank, fills a cup,is heading
back to the dying man when Orderly 1 approaches again.
ORDERLY 1
One of the boys was insisting he
knew you, probably delirium, I’ve
seen it before Where?

VERA

Some wounded tommies lying on the ground nearby listen.
ORDERLY 1
We had to take him round the back.
A grimace suggests this is not a good place to be.
ORDERLY 1
Said his name was Edward I think Vera starts - looks at him - then heads immediately off.
WOUNDED TOMMY
Oi, Miss, I’m Edward too, you know!
And me!

ANOTHER WOUNDED TOMMY

Vera disappears from view, the tommies grin at one another.
149

EXT. BACK OF TENTS - A MINUTE LATER

149

Vera is round the back of the tents, where the dying men have
been taken. Most of them are either unconscious, or already
dead. She passes among them, heart in her mouth, scanning
their faces, searching...Dorothy, the young VAD, comes up to
her.
DOROTHY
Nurse Brittain! This lot are done
for, you’re needed in surgery.
Then she sees him - Edward, unconscious on a stretcher. He
looks dead. She rushes to him.
DOROTHY
Nurse! They want you now!

Vera is oblivious. She falls to her knees, checks quickly finds a pulse.
VERA
He’s alive -!
She checks him over VERA
It’s not gas...not gas...Edward!
No response. She finds a large, infected wound on his arm.
She spots a few orderlies nearby.
VERA
Help me! Quickly!
They head over, help her lift the stretcher.
150

INT. BRITISH HUT - LATER

150

Vera has found a space for Edward in a hut, where the wounded
are packed in like sardines. Flies buzz, the heat is
stifling. She’s quickly cutting his jacket off him, as Hope
administers him with an injection.
HOPE
(grim faced)
Vera, you have to face it...
VERA
(doesn’t want to hear it)
No! No...
She doesn’t take her eyes from Edward - every inch of her
strength is concentrated on him. Hope realises - gives her a
quick pat, and withdraws.
Vera finds something in his jacket pocket - a dirt-stained
letter. She opens it, scans it quickly, sees the signature
“Geoffrey” - puts it to one side.

Vera is intensely focused on Edward, nursing him as he tosses
with a searing fever, his body wracked, muttering and
groaning.

Vera is carrying a gramophone player across the ward, back to
Edward’s bed, where he lies sleeping. She sets it up beside

A vast expanse of mud. Geoffrey is one in a line of battleweary men, trudging their way back from the front line.
GEOFFREY’S VOICE
It was a scene of devastation,
and yet, as I looked at it, a
strange feeling came over me...
Geoffrey turns. On the horizon, beyond the mud, are shelltorn trees with blackened, claw-like branches, lit by the
brilliant gold of a setting sun. He stops to watch, as the
other men carry on.
GEOFFREY’S VOICE
The setting sun had lit up the
water in the shell holes so they
looked like pools of gold, We see the field of mud through Geoffrey’s eyes now dotted with little pools of bright gold water. His eyes
move to a river, running along the bottom of the trees,
also lit in gold.

you always wanted to do.
VERA
If this War ever ends!
It will.

VERA
I can’t imagine that anymore.
Do it.

VERA
Only if you come too Edward suddenly hugs her, very tight.
EDWARD
You leave first, otherwise I won’t
have the strength to.
Vera turns slowly, heads back towards the base. She turns one
last time, to see Edward standing watching her. He raises a
hand in farewell, gives her a cheerful smile and a nod, and
climbs up into the bus.

Hope glances over it, gives her a sympathetic look.

We’re inside the large, staid hallway. A grandfather clock

the noisy chaos of Etaples.
The front door is pushed open, Vera struggles in with her
luggage. She stands there, still in her uniform, taking in
the atmosphere. No servants, no signs of real life.

She looks pale and strained, but not seriously ill. Vera
looks at her in dismay.
Mother...?

MRS. BRITTAIN
I’ve had a terrible turn. Cook

Vera is putting the flowers down when she glances up out of
the window to see something in the distance On a visible stretch of the white winding road, a boy on a

herself feel some relief, when He bobs back into view, closer now to the house. Vera
watches him through the glass, as he stops at the garden
gate. Cycles up to the front door - disappears from view
beneath the porch. She hears the clang of the doorbell.
Vera is frozen, waiting.
A figure steps out from beneath the porch.
Edward. In his khaki. He looks up at her. Vera puts her
hands on the pane, as though to reach him She hears her father answer the door - a muffled exchange.
Below, Edward fades to nothing.
Then - the sound of a terrible, animal cry from her father.
Vera - seen from behind. Head bowed, hands against the
glass pane.

Vera marches past the room to see the new maid calmly

The girl bursts into tears. Vera storms out of the back

footsteps. Vera looks up to see two young nurses, faces
flushed, running towards her.
CELEBRATING NURSES
It’s over! The armistice is

Vera just watches with no reaction. There’s the sound of
celebrations already kicking off in the street outside.

seas LOOMS ahead of her now As the whispering grows louder, and she sees the women
taking shape in the darkness, their desperate prayers Vera puts her hands over her ears to block the sound - then

Vera is walking through the gardens when she sees a group of

One of them, Winifred, a flamboyantly dressed girl with an

tame, roars with laughter. She looks up, notices Vera
watching. She looks so isolated, like a shadow...
Winifred gets up to beckon her over, but Vera hurries away.

No response. Winifred ploughs on.
WINIFRED (CONT’D)
If there’s ever a book you can’t
find here, just ask. It’ll probably
be buried under the mess in my

the paper.
Her hands start to shake.

Winifred sees her anguish.

Vera is lying on her side, in bed. The crisis is over, but
her expression is blank, pale, without hope. Behind her
stands Winifred, holding books and some grapes.
WINIFRED
I brought some more books for
you.
Vera remains with her back turned, saying nothing. Winifred
decides to open the curtains, letting in a flood of
sunlight. Then comes back and sits down.
WINIFRED (CONT’D)
Did you manage to read the last
ones?
Winifred sees a pile of books on the floor, they look
untouched. She sits down. Vera feels her patient, calm
presence. After a moment - Vera turns to face her.
VERA
I saved my brother’s life over
there. In France. (Pause) But the
War still got him.

It made us all feel powerless.

Miss Lorimer is sitting at her desk when there’s a knock at

MISS LORIMER
Not now, thank you!
She hears a noise, looks up in irritation to see Vera
standing there. She softens just slightly.
MISS LORIMER
Miss Brittain. What is it?
Vera approaches.
VERA
I’m sorry to disturb you A pause. Vera is nervous.
VERA (CONT’D)
I wanted to say thank you for
allowing me to come back again. I
do really appreciate it.

I can’t tell you the bother it
caused.
A pause.
MISS LORIMER (CONT’D)
If that’s everything?

I feel I need to study real events,
I mean, why things happen the way
they do, between people and nations
- and what, if anything, we can do
to stop or change them.
Silence.
VERA (CONT’D)
I realise this looks like a
reaction to the last four years,
and possibly it’s a sign I’m a mess
and it won’t solve anything - but
I’ve given it a lot of thought and it’s the only way I can try to make
sense of things.
Miss Lorimer gets to her feet, walks round her desk, glances
briefly at the photo of her dead brother. Vera has no idea
which way this is going.
MISS LORIMER
I understand you were at the front?
Vera is surprised at this turn in the conversation - she
nods.
MISS LORIMER (CONT’D)
I did wonder about you, as a matter
of fact.
They hold each other’s gaze - much is unspoken.
MISS LORIMER
I’ll see what I can do.
Vera sees the sympathy and understanding in her face.
Thank you.

MALE SPEAKER
There’s talk among our politicians
of how to make Germany pay for the
last four years...
Vera hears cheers, stops before a poster outside which reads:
“War Reparations - Should Germany pay?”
MALE SPEAKER (CONT’D)
Only recently the German foreign
minister dared suggest that we’re
all responsible for the War and
should jointly pay the price! To
which we say to him, who started
it?!
More cheers - Vera goes inside.
193

INT. OXFORD HALL - A LITTLE LATER

193

Vera is pushing her way to the front of a large, angry
crowd, mainly of locals, roused by a middle-aged speaker on
stage.
MALE SPEAKER
There’s nothing the Kaiser can do
to compensate the men and women of
this country, but still, the
Germans must pay! In money, in
goods and industry, and most of
all, in humbled pride!

Salmon Revision 21.04.14

111

Vera looks at the faces in the crowd - most of them nodding
in heartfelt support, muttering angrily to themselves.
One face arrests her for its familiarity - it’s GEORGE, the
officer who told her of Roland’s death. He hasn’t seen her.
MALE SPEAKER (CONT’D)
History has proved the Huns can’t
be trusted. Our chance is now, when
we’ve got them on their knees! We
need to pound them into the ground
for what they did to us, so they’re
incapable of rising again!
Cheers, shouts of “Hear hear!” “Get the bloody Huns!” from
the audience.
GEORGE O.S.
There’s a flaw to your argument!
People turn, take in George.
MALE SPEAKER
Come up on stage, Sir, unlike the
Kaiser’s lackeys, we British
welcome dissent!
Laughs, cheers, as George leaps onto the stage.
GEORGE
The philosophy of an eye for an eye
and a tooth for a tooth, is a
dangerous one, surely. Germany will
rise again one day, and if her
pride is too damaged she’ll do so
intent on revenge, and the whole
cycle could be repeated!
MALE SPEAKER
Are you suggesting we let them walk
all over us?
An angry MOTHER pushes her way to the front.
MALE SPEAKER (CONT’D)
We have mothers here whose sons
gave their lives for the nation!
This lady here - look her in the
eye, Sir, and tell her to love the
Germans!
Cries of support for this - the angry mother wants to get up
on the stage - the speaker helps her up.

They killed my eldest at the Somme!

They’re war mongers! They bombed
our cities first! And our ships!
GEORGE
We have to look to the future - to
the world we want to create!
More shouts of outrage, boos! George looks cornered. This is
too much for Vera - she pushes through to the front, holds
out a hand. George helps her up. He recognises her, with a
start.
GEORGE (CONT’D)
Miss Brittain!
Officer -

VERA

GEORGE
George, please....George Catlin.
They shake hands hastily, as Vera is bustled to the front.

The lady has something to say!
She realises all eyes are on her. She’s thrown suddenly - a
pause, then VERA
I - I was a nurse at the front
during the War.

VERA
As you were speaking, I was
remembering one of them. I never
knew his name, but he was a brave
man, and somebody’s son. I held his
hand as he was dying Murmurs - people don’t like this. Some get up and walk out.
VERA (CONT’D)
He cried out for a woman he loved,
Klara. He faced the end of his life
by asking her forgiveness!
Mutterings of disapproval swell louder - Vera looks at the
angry mother.
VERA (CONT’D)
I lost a brother in the war, and my
fiance! There was no final message
for them, no hand to hold; just
pain and a dirty, undignified
death! I can’t make sense of it
either, except - when I held the
hand of that German, it was their
hands too that I was holding their pain was the same pain, their
blood the same blood - our grief is
the grief of hundreds and thousands
of German women and men!
People now start to BOO loudly, the mother walks out, more
follow her, until only a few are left.
VERA (CONT’D)
I speak to those of us who were
left behind. The mothers, sisters,
the women - we send our men to war!
I fought my father to let my
brother go. Because we think it’s
the right thing, the honourable
thing, but all I can do is stand
here and ask you, is it? Was I
right? Or can I find the courage to
accept there might be another way?
(Pause) Perhaps their deaths might
have some meaning if we stand
together now, and say no! No to
fighting, no to war! No to the
endless cycle of revenge. (Pause) I
say no more of it!
The few remaining people are silent, as her words resonate.

EXT. OXFORD LANE - DAY

205A

As a new, calmer Vera walks back towards College, Winifred
joins her, wheeling her bike. They walk and chat together in
easy companionship.

EXT./INT. SOMERVILLE/PORTER’S LODGE - DAY

206

Vera and Winifred walk through the gates into college and
into the porter’s lodge.
They check their pigeon holes for post - Vera’s surprised to
see a note there. She opens it. It reads simply: “May I see
you again? George.”
Vera looks up - catches Winifred’s eye, then looks away,
smiling softly.
CUT TO BLACK:
AS, ON-SCREEN, THE FOLLOWING WORDS APPEAR:
“Testament of Youth” was published in 1933, to immediate
acclaim. The first print-run sold out in a day, and the book
became the voice of a generation. It remains in print to this
day, as one of the most powerful war memoirs ever written.
Vera became a life-long pacifist and campaigner for women’s
rights, and a successful writer and journalist.
She and George married and had two children. Their daughter,
Shirley Williams, became a leading force in British politics,
and now sits in the House of Lords.

The End.
