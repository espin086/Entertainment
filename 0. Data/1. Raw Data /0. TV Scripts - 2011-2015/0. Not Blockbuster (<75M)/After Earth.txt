INT. OLD RAIGE APARTMENT - DAY

THE SOUND OF THE AIR RAID ALARM IS REVERBERATING THROUGH THE
AIR. NINE-YEAR-OLD KITAI has stopped playing in his room. He
moves the hair from his eyes. He looks out and sees the
walkway outside. This is an apartment only two floors from
the ground.

He sees his sister SENSHI, 19, running along the walkway moving people hurriedly.

SENSHI
Kit, we have to go. Right now.

Nine-year-old Kitai sits frightened. Senshi returns to the
apartment. She is a young Ranger. She is in uniform, holding
a cutlass. She looks to her little brother.

SUDDENLY THERE IS A LOUD TERRIFYING SCREECHING SOUND - A
CREATURE SOUND. Nine-year-old Kitai covers his ears.
Is that..?

Nine-year-old Kitai does as his sister says. Senshi’s eyes
search her little brother’s room. She sees a rectangular
glass box with plants in it. It is covered. She finds a
remote on the table. She presses a button. The lid opens and
closes.
Senshi straps her cutlass expertly to her back. It
magnetically sticks. She pulls all the plants out of the
glass case. She pulls the case across the floor and turns it
on its side. She shoves it under the bed with Kitai.
SENSHI
Climb in here, okay? It won’t be
able to smell you.
Nine-year-old Kitai does as he’s told. She hands him the
remote. She hands him an extra cutlass from her bag.

Senshi hits the remote in Kitai’s hands. The glass box
closes. Nine-year-old Kitai watches his sister stand. She
pulls the cutlass from her back. Her fingers tap a pattern on
the cutlass’s handle that reads, “Cutlass C-6.” The cutlass’s
thousands of steel-like fibers extend on either side into
razor-sharp points. The cutlass is now six feet long.
THERE IS A SHADOW THAT PASSES OVER THE OTHER ROOM OF THE
APARTMENT.

Senshi moves into the other room. She spins the cutlass in
her hand.
Senshi is partially obscured by our view from under the bed.

Furniture gets thrown in the room. Senshi expertly wields her
cutlass. She gets hidden momentarily from our view through
the doorway. WE SEE THE CREATURE’S ARM REACH OUT. Senshi
parkours off the corner of the room away from it.
And then we see Senshi get struck.
Nine-year-old Kitai’s face contorts in terror.
Senshi is thrown across the room. Senshi is dazed. She tries
to stand. She screams as the creature descends on her. She is
obscured from sight by its huge body.
Kitai taps a pattern on the handle of the cutlass in his
hands. It extends, razor-sharp at the ends.

He is terrified as he clutches the weapon. He doesn’t move
from his hiding place. Tears stream down Kitai’s face.
The creature POUNCES AGAIN, then it’s on her, and Kitai hears
her VOICE, no longer a Ranger, but a girl -SENSHI (O.S.)

There is the movement of people outside on the walkway. The
creature strangely grabs Senshi’s lifeless body and holds it
up against the window of the apartment. We hear the group
outside the apartment start screaming in terror.

The creature looks around and moves after the people outside.
Nine-year-old Kitai stares at the body of his sister. Her
