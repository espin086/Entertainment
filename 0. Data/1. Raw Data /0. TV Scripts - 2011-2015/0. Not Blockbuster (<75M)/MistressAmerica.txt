MISTRESS AMERICA

Noah Baumbach and Greta Gerwig

BLACK
TRACY (V.O.)
She would say things like: “Isn’t
every story a story of betrayal?”
No, that’s not true, I thought.
But I could never say that, I could
only agree with her. It was too
much fun to agree with her.
INT. DORM ROOM. DAY
A dark room. We hear movement from outside. A key in the
lock. The door opens, light from the hallway silhouettes
Tracy as she hauls in a bag on wheels. She feels for a light
on the wall and hits the switch. The lights come on.
VOICE
I was sleeping! Turn that off!
Tracy shuts the light.
TRACY
Sorry.
(pause)
I’m your roommate.
LAURA (V.O.)
My name is Laura...
INT. DORM COMMON ROOM. DAY
A group of ten freshman sit around in a circle.
Laura, holds a flashlight and says:

One girl,

LAURA
...and I’m going on safari and I’m
bringing with me a ROLLING PIN for
Ruth, a CAR for Carrie...
(everyone laughs)
A JAR for Juman and a... a... shit.
She stares at Tracy, unable to get her name.
TRACY
A TRACKING DEVICE for Tracy...
LAURA
...Right a TRACKING DEVICE for
Tracy and a...LIGHTER for me,
Laura.
She passes the flashlight.

Tracy pipes up:

2.
INT. DORM ROOM. EARLY EVENING
Tracy sits in her new dorm-room with her roommate, a girl
with mousy hair and a hoodie. She watches Tracy unpack, from
her bed.
TRACY
Aren’t you coming to convocation?
RUTH
You’re going to that shit?
TRACY
Yeah... isn’t everyone?
RUTH
I don’t think anyone is going.
Except rapists.
What?

TRACY
Why rapists?

RUTH
Or Christians and home-schooled
kids. Nobody really goes.
TRACY
I think it’s just a candle lighting
ceremony.
(pause)
How do you already know all this
stuff? School hasn’t even started
yet.
Ruth doesn’t answer.
EXT. COLLEGE CHAPEL. EVENING
Tracy lingers outside the building. Kids are going inside.
She hesitates then decides to bag it.
EXT. BROADWAY, UPPER WEST SIDE. NIGHT
Tracy walks aimlessly.
INT. DINING HALL. DAY
Tracy gets a personal sized pizza and a bowl of cereal. She
picks up and inspects different items on the dessert tray,
doesn’t take any.
INT. CLASSROOM. DAY
In class.

Gets a paper back.

She gets a B.

3.
PROFESSOR
This is a starting point - this is
what college is for, we’re going to
teach you how to write and think.
TRACY
(frowns, to the person
next to her.)
A “B.” That’s so annoying.
INT. CAFETERIA.

EVE

Tracy eats by herself.
INT. MENTAL HEALTH OFFICE. DAY
Tracy sits in front of a counselor.
TRACY
Um, I have trouble with
procrastinating.
COUNSELOR
Did you ever think of just getting
your work in on time?
TRACY
(hesitates)
Yes, I have thought of that.
have trouble doing it.

I

COUNSELOR
Maybe you want to try a little
harder?
TRACY
OK, thanks. Harder?
that.

I’ll try

EXT. RIVERSIDE PARK. DAY
Tracy walks alone.
INT. ENGLISH CLASS. DAY
PROFESSOR (V.O.)
What comes to mind when you think
of the Renaissance?
INT. CLASSROOM. DAY
Tracy takes notes while a Southern girl talks:

4.
SOUTHERN GIRL
I think of the Renaissance as being
very plush, like a lot of velvet
inlaid with jewels, brocades, that
kind of thing.
PROFESSOR
Thank you... I was actually asking
about literature, but that was very
nice.
Tracy bursts out laughing.
INT. DORM HALLWAY. NIGHT
Tracy is kind of “dressed” for a party. There are a bunch of
drunk teenagers around. She sees a Friendly Looking Girl:
TRACY
Is the party at the end of the
hall?
FRIENDLY LOOKING GIRL
Did you get an invitation?
No...
Then no.

TRACY
FRIENDLY LOOKING GIRL
OTHER GIRL
She’s being a bitch. Yes, it’s
down the hall.
The Friendly Looking Girl hits the Other Girl and they run
away, laughing. Tracy leaves the way she came.
EXT. CAMPUS/INT. JERSEY HOUSE. NIGHT INTERCUT
Tracy sits on steps.

She’s on the phone with her Mom.

TRACY
I could be anywhere. It doesn’t
even feel like New York. And by
trying to participate I’m somehow
fitting in even less.
Her Mom moves through the kitchen, cleaning, putting things
away.
MOM
Aren’t you meeting friends in
classes?

5.
TRACY
Mom, nobody meets friends in
classes.
Oh, okay.

MOM
I didn’t know.

TRACY
You know the feeling of being at a
party where you don’t know anybody?
It’s like that the whole time.
MOM
That sounds uncomfortable.
TRACY
And I can’t go to bars.
MOM
Don’t go to bars. Oh, did you get
my email with the reading - do you
like it?
TRACY
I liked it. I think there is a
darker element to what Shakespeare
was saying but I liked it.
MOM
Good. Your brother is going to be
playing guitar with you while you
do it - is that okay?
TRACY
I like David’s guitar playing.
MOM
(happily)
He’s gotten good, right? I’m so
excited! It’s Thanksgiving weekend
so we’ll have a built-in rehearsal
dinner on Thursday at the house.
It’ll be the first time the two
families are all in the same room.
Randy, Jim’s sister -Right.

TRACY
MOM
She’s going to make a fig and
there’s a fish...and it’s on
cracker. That’s one thing.

6.

Mmm.

TRACY
MOM
We’re going to move all the
furniture out of the living room
and we changed the lyrics to
Finiculi Finicula. We did the same
thing at Izzy’s 60th but Izzy won’t
be there so it’ll feel fresh.
(exhaling, playful)
Oh, Trace...
TRACY
(playful back)
Oh, Stevie.
MOM
You know, I was very unhappy for a
very long time. But I’m so glad
your Dad and I stayed together
until you and your brother were out
of school.
TRACY
I was NOT out of school. You broke
up when I was a junior in high
school.
MOM
On your way out of the home...
TRACY
I love you Mom, don’t be worried.
MOM
I know, honey. So after you do
that, Brooke will read a poem she’s
written. I don’t think her brother
is doing anything - which hurts my
feelings, but I’m trying to be okay
with it.
(has an idea)
You should call Brooke. She’s in
New York, you know.
TRACY
I’m so bad at calling people I
don’t know.
MOM
I hear she’s fun.

7.
TRACY
She’s like thirty living in New
York with a life, she doesn’t need
to hear from an eighteen year old
she’s tenuously connected to. I’d
be like why do I want to hang out
with you?
MOM
She’s going to be your sister, that
doesn’t sound tenuous to me. And
you have plenty to talk about you’re both doing readings at our
wedding.
TRACY
Aces.
MOM
You aren’t sarcastic don’t pretend
to be.
TRACY
Okay.
INT. CLASSROOM. DAY
We hear a student, Nicolette, making a point:
NICOLETTE
Nothing is higher than the law.
That’s the whole point - Antigone
thinks she’s above the law but
she’s not - like a celebrity in a
car crash or something.
Tracy is asleep at the seminar table.
to one side.
Psst.

Her head hangs heavily

VOICE
Hey.

Tracy’s head jerks up and she opens her sleepy eyes.
Tony leans over from two chairs away.
TONY
You were asleep.
TRACY
(wiping drool from her
chin)
Oh...thanks.

A boy,

Tracy sits up straighter. She tries to focus on the
discussion. Her eyes fall heavy and shut. She’s asleep
again.
INT. HALLWAY. AFTER CLASS
Tony carries a briefcase.

Tracy, deciding to make her fate

TRACY
That was really nice of you...
waking me up.
TONY
(smiling)
It takes a lot of moxie to fall
asleep in a twelve person class.
Thanks.

TRACY
I like moxie.

TONY
I get it. It’s like I’m so
grateful to be here, but why are my
parents taking out loans for me to
listen to that 18-year-old asshole
talk?
Tracy laughs.
TRACY
Loans everywhere.
TONY
I was going go get frozen yogurt,
want to come?
TRACY
Yes but... well, I have to get
somewhere by five.
Where?

TONY
TRACY
Um, it’s embarrassing.
TONY
What is it?
TRACY
I’m submitting a story to the
Mobius Literary Society. I have to
print it.
(MORE)

9.
TRACY (CONT'D)
They only take hard copies which is
a kind of pretension I can get
behind.
TONY
GET OUT OF TOWN SISTER! I already
gave mine! Do you know how you
find out if you’re in it?
TRACY
They said they’d post a list TONY
No. The only people who check the
list are people who didn’t get in they come wake us up at night in
our rooms and put pie in our face
and then bring us out into the quad
and make us sing and stuff.
TRACY
(smiling at the thought)
Yeah.
INT. SOME HALLWAY. DAY
Tracy walks down to a door with Mobius on the glass. There’s
a box outside with Submissions written underneath it. A guy
in a sweater vest sitting cross legged on the ground playing
jacks stares at her. She fishes into her messenger bag and
puts a story in the box. She hurries away.
INT. TRACY’S DORM ROOM. NIGHT
Tracy lies awake in bed. We hear yelling in the hallway
outside her door. Footsteps come close to her door. A
shadow underneath. She tenses in great anticipation.
The footsteps and chatter continue down the hall.
Tracy gets up and opens her door.
INT. DORM HALLWAY. NIGHT
The hall is empty. Bits of pie and crust on the floor.
Another door opens at the end of the hall. A Tiny Girl looks
out.
She and Tracy meet eyes.
FUCK.

TINY GIRL
The Tiny Girl retreats into her room.

Tracy does the same.

INT. TONY’S ROOM. DAY
Tony sits on his bed and Tracy sits on the floor.
drink screwdrivers.

They both

TONY
They’re self-elected douche bags.
TRACY
I know, but I wanted to be one of
them. I could die then.
TONY
Yeah, me too. Both I wanted to be
in and I could also then die.
TRACY
I heard they serve wine and cheese
and they all carry breifcases.
TONY
I know, when I had my tour here,
the guide was one of them and
that’s why I wanted to come here.
TRACY
I heard the pie stuff all night.
TONY
They got the guy next door. He
doesn’t even look like a writer.
Tony indicates a breifcase from the floor.

Tracy sees this.

TRACY
I’m so sorry.
TONY
Do you want to trade stories?
Sure.

TRACY
TIME CUT
They both silently read each other’s stories.

TIME CUT
TONY
I liked it!

They steal

TRACY
Thanks - I liked yours too.
TONY
So do you want notes?
TRACY
Oh, are we - sure...
TONY
Okay, I thought the middle part
sounded really fake.
Okay.

TRACY
TONY
It’s just my impression.
TRACY
I’ll work on that.
TONY
Do you have any notes for me?
Um... no.

TRACY
TONY
Great.
(thinks for a second)
I have a car.
INT. CAR. DUSK
Tracy and Tony drive in the car.
TRACY
Let’s go to the beach.
TONY
I don’t want to leave Manhattan.
TRACY
Oh, why are we in your car then?
EXT. UPPER MANHATTAN, BY THE HUSDON RIVER. NIGHT
Tracy and Tony try to burn his briefcase but it won’t catch
fire.
They chuck it in the water.
They smoke a joint and sit on the roof of a car.

12.
TRACY
We look like we’re in a song.
INT. CLASSROOM. DAY
Tracy raises her hand.
TRACY
I think the way Aristotle writes
about ethics and morality is much
closer to how most people think
about it. Less like math, more
like a story.
INT. DORM ROOM. DAY
Tracy, feeling better about herself, cleans the room and
talks to her roommate.
TRACY
I think we should set up a
recycling system for our trash. A
lot of what we’re throwing out can
be recycled.
She trips over something on the floor but recovers quickly.
TRACY
And Ruth, I think that fan can go
in the closet now, it’s 60 degrees
out-INT. STUDY ABROAD OFFICE. DAY
Tracy is filing with some exuberance.
STUDY ABROAD WOMAN
You seem happy today.
TRACY
I love filing! It’s satisfying.
EXT. QUAD. EVE
Tracy is running to get somewhere.
TONY (O.S.)
Slow down, T!
Tracy hits the breaks. It’s Tony. She laughs. But he’s
holding Nicolette’s hand (She’s the girl from their class).
Hey.

TRACY

Hey.
Hey.

NICOLETTE
INT. JJ’S DINER. NIGHT
Tracy sits in a booth by herself eating mozzarella sticks.
She looks at her phone. Makes a call. Her mother’s voice
mail. She hangs up.
She scrolls to:
BROOKE CARDINAS
She quickly presses that name...
FEMALE VOICE MESSAGE
You’ve reached Brooke Cardinas.
Leave your name and number and I
will get back to you at my earliest
convenience.
Tracy hangs up on the beep. She dips a mozzarella stick in
the red sauce and shoves it into her mouth. Her phone rings.
She’s startled.
Hello?

TRACY
BROOKE
Hi, this Brooke Cardinas. I just
got a missed call from this number.
TRACY
Oh...sorry. Hi... this is Tracy
Fishko, um, my mom is marrying your
dad?
BROOKE
You’re reading the sonnet.
TRACY
Right! We’re doing Thanksgiving
and then wedding together... Um, I
go to college in the city. My mom
said I should call you.
BROOKE
Have you eaten? Do you want to
hang out?

14.
TRACY
(looks at her nearfinished plate)
No, I haven’t. OK.
BROOKE
Well, do you know where Times
Square is?
EXT. TIMES SQUARE. NIGHT
Tracy crosses the crowded street.
Brooke is at the top of the TKTS steps. She attempts to walk
elegantly down the steps. It’s an entrance.
BROOKE
(awkwardly grand)
Welcome to the Great White Way.
She still hasn’t finished walking the steps. It takes a
second. Tracy holds a smile. Finally, Brooke is there:
TRACY
Times Square is so crazy.
Isn’t it?

BROOKE
TRACY
I don’t know anyone who lives here.
BROOKE
Yours truly. I got off the bus from
Jersey I thought this was the cool
place to live. It’s mother fucking
Times Square.
INT. TAXI. LATER
Brooke lights a cigarette, takes a long drag, passes it to
Tracy.
BROOKE
Why do you live in New York again?
TRACY
College - I go to Barnard - it’s
all women uptown - well,
“historically” and kind of
actually. But there are boys in my
classes and stuff. From Columbia.

15.

You gay?

BROOKE
TRACY
No. The Columbia girls do their
best to make us feel inferior.
Which it’s like “I already do.”
BROOKE
That’s stupid. Don’t feel
inferior.
TRACY
You’re right, that is stupid.
It’s the best someone has made her feel in a long time or
maybe ever.
INT. BACKSTAGE AT A MUSIC CLUB. NIGHT
Brooke, wearing an orange VIP sticker on her suede jacket,
affixes an identical sticker to Tracy’s shirt.
BROOKE
I didn’t go to college.
Oh.

OK.

TRACY
BROOKE
I’m an autodidact.
what that means?
Yes.

Do you know

TRACY
BROOKE
That word is one of the things I
self-taught myself.
CUT TO: Brooke is pulled up onstage to sing, she tries to
act like she doesn’t want to and then does it. When she
dances while she sings it’s a person who is pretending to be
free.
EXT. BAR. NIGHT
Brooke, Tracy and members of the band enter one of those
secret bars, through the back of a pizza shop.
INT. SECRET BAR. NIGHT
Tracy drinks a fancy cocktail.

16.
TRACY
It has mint!
CUT TO: Brooke and Tracy dance with the guys.
BROOKE
(dancing)
What’s going on at college?
TRACY
(also dancing)
I don’t know, everyone’s really
excited about the frozen yogurt
machine in the student center.
BROOKE
I watched my mother die.
What?

TRACY
BROOKE
I was with my mother while she
died.
TRACY
I don’t know any dead people.
BROOKE
That’s cool about the frozen yogurt
machine. Everyone I love dies.
INT. WILLIAMSBURG PARTY. NIGHT
Brooke and Tracy enter some party in Williamsburg.
hostess hugs Brooke.

The

WOMAN
I heard you’re opening a
restaurant!? WTF?!
INT. WILLIAMSBURG BEDROOM. NIGHT
Brooke and Tracy are in a closet - Brooke is going through it
while Tracy watches her.
BROOKE
This bitch stole my favorite pants they’re in here somewhere - she
thinks I don’t know but I know
everything. They’re red.

17.
TRACY
(vaguely)
I’ll look here.
Tracy starts going through the closet.
BROOKE
People are always taking my shit.
My ex-friend and nemesis, MamieClaire, stole my ideas AND my
fiance.
Shit.

TRACY
BROOKE
She took this T-shirt idea that I
had, started a company fucking sold
it to J. Crew so there is that.
She’s one of those people who
doesn’t have any good ideas for her
own life so she just steals all of
mine. And then she LITERALLY stole
my cats.
TRACY
What were the T-shirts?
BROOKE
Just really hard looking flowers.
Oh my God!
shirts!

TRACY
I bought one of those T-

BROOKE
Yeah, flowers with like skulls and
shit. Daggers.
TRACY
That’s a great one.
BROOKE
My fiance, Dylan, was super sexy.
And so rich. But I wasn’t going to
marry him.
TRACY
So...wait, you broke up with Dylan?
I thought she stole him?
BROOKE
And I never looked back.
so hard. Like, whiney.

He cried

18.
She does an impression:
BROOKE
“Where are you going?”
(back to herself)
I was being real, but Mamie-Claire
then goes and marries him. They
live in Greenwich, Connecticut in
some big gross house. Do you know
that place?
TRACY
Yeah, Greenwich, grossville.
BROOKE
Right? Living off of his riches
and my T-shirt idea.
TRACY
(instant disciple)
I hate them.
BROOKE
I actually pity them.
more dreams.

They have no

Tracy holds up a pair of red pants, triumphant.
These?!

TRACY
BROOKE
I want to MARRY you!
She grabs the pants, stuffs them in her purse and then gets
out of the closet.
INT. WILLIAMSBURG PARTY. NIGHT
Brooke makes out with Nate, the singer. Tracy is trying not
to watch. Another band member takes a picture on his iPhone.
BROOKE
Must we all document ourselves all
the time? MUST WE?!
INT. VESELKA. LATE NIGHT
Tracy and Brooke eat pierogis in the mostly empty diner.
TRACY
Is he your boyfriend?

The bassist?

19.
BROOKE
Nate? No! My beau, Stavros, is in
Greece right now. Betting against
the country or something gross.
Don’t tell anyone that.
TRACY
(dead serious)
I won’t. I’m good at keeping
secrets. You’ll learn that about
me.
BROOKE
He’s one of those people I hate
except I’m in love with him. I’ve
been to a Greek Orthodox Easter and
I could totally see myself getting
married in that kind of church.
She knocks her head for wood.
BROOKE
You got a honey?
TRACY
Nah, there’s this one guy, we got
rejected together...but he’s got a
girlfriend.
BROOKE
They all have girlfriends.
TRACY
Actually I think he met me and then
he got a girlfriend.
(pause)
This summer, at my job, one guy
just sucked on my boobs all night.
BROOKE
(thinking aloud)
My restaurant should do a pierogi.
Fusion pierogi. You like yours?
TRACY
(nods, stuffing a pierogi
in her mouth)
This is my second dinner.
Brooke takes out her phone and types something.
BROOKE
(putting her phone back)
Just a quick tweet on Twitter.
(MORE)

20.
BROOKE (CONT'D)
I am VERY into social media. You
have to market yourself. If you
don’t know what you’re selling, no
one will know how to buy it.
TRACY
What are you selling?
BROOKE
So many things. I don’t tweet all
of it. Like here are two ideas
that are not on the internet. If I
did a cabaret, it would be called
“High Standards” and I’d sing all
the standards.
TRACY
Would you sing them in a higher
pitch?
BROOKE
No, it wouldn’t be about - it’s
about principles, those kinds of
high standards - like one of those
“string of pearls that’s why I’m a
single gal” kind of show.
TRACY
That’s clever.
BROOKE
The second idea is a television
show, which I’ve read is the new
novel, about a woman who is a
government worker by day and a selfinvented super hero by night, but
like the essence of AMERICA. It’ll
be it’s own mythology. I think
maybe it’ll be called Mistress
America.
TRACY
That sounds like she’s America’s
girl on the side.
BROOKE
Hey, I don’t know, okay, I’m not
positive, these are just some
ideas.
TRACY
Me too! I’m sorry, I don’t know
anything, I was just throwing
something out there.

21.
They both laugh.
BROOKE
(an idea)
We need a sleep-over party.
INT. BROOKE’S APARTMENT. NIGHT
Books piled on the floor. Lots of drawings pinned to the
wall. One framed piece of real art.
BROOKE
This apartment is technically zoned
commercial but that’s fake.
TRACY
It’s so stylish.
BROOKE
Fuck, I know, I freelance as an
interior decorator. You know the
Bowery Hotel?
TRACY
Oh my God, yeah.
BROOKE
Well, if you walk about a block
south. There’s a laser hair
removal center that’s very hip.

Cool.

BROOKE
BROOKE
I’m leaving here in January anyway,
moving to the East side if you can
believe it. That’s where Stavros
lives. I’m going to redo his place
too.
Brooke flops on her bed.

Tracy lies on the couch.

TRACY
I want to write short stories.
BROOKE
Oh, me too! Not short stories,
though.

22.
TRACY
But I got rejected by the Lit
Society. I’m so suggestible, like
because I got rejected I think I
can’t be a writer.
BROOKE
Why don’t you make your own Lit
Society?
I wish.

TRACY
Mobius is a big deal at

BROOKE
You’ve got other stories.
TRACY
(smiling)
Maybe I’ll write something else and
resubmit.
(falling asleep, eyes
closed)
That was really funny when we were
doctors.
BROOKE
Yeah, I need to cut all the
negative people out of my life. I
just wasn’t brought up that way.
TRACY
Thank you Brooke.
BROOKE
You’re welcome Baby Tracy.
INT. BROOKE’S APARTMENT. NEXT MORNING
Brooke is on the phone with Stavros:
BROOKE
My sweetheart I miss you so much I can’t wait for you to see the
chairs I’ve picked out - we start
renovation Monday! It’s so
exciting. I’ve been going there
just to sit in the mess I love it
so much.
Tracy wakes up a little with the noise.

23.
BROOKE
Right. Did you see the lease it
was 400 pages! I wish you would
just come home already so I can
suck your dick in our new
restaurant!
She pads into the kitchen.
BROOKE
(to Tracy)
Can you start the coffee, please?
TRACY
(looking at the coffee
maker)
I don’t know how...
BROOKE
(a little sharply)
Yes, you do. Don’t be incompetent.
If you spent two seconds with a
coffee maker you’d figure it out.
You just aren’t trying hard enough.
Brooke retreats into the hall, still talking to her
boyfriend.
TRACY
Um, where are you going.
BROOKE
DUH COMMUNAL BATHROOM DO YOU WANT
TO WATCH?
(to the phone)
Are you still there?
Sorry.
NO!

TRACY
Are you... mad at me?
BROOKE (O.S.)

CUT TO: Tracy and Brooke drink coffee at her table/desk.
BROOKE
We have four investors including
me. I’m what you call a principal
investor. Stavros is putting in my
share - but I insisted that it be
my assets on the line because I
want him to know I have skin in the
game. I’ll pay him back of course
once we start making a profit.

24.
TRACY
We never went to restaurants
growing up - it wasn’t part of our
lives.
BROOKE
(immediately offended)
That’s a shitty thing to say to me.
TRACY
I didn’t mean - I know people will
come to yours.
(trying to contextualize)
It’s so weird to think that every
restaurant I see is the result of
some person going “I think I want
to start a restaurant.”
BROOKE
That’s not weird.

Tracy starts to write something down in a notebook.
is curious:
BROOKE
What are you doing?
TRACY
I’m actually... it’s embarrassing.
What?

BROOKE
TRACY
I’m writing down what I said.
BROOKE
You are noting yourself?
TRACY
Yeah... I guess so.
BROOKE
I’ve noticed something about myself
that would make a good character in
a story.
Oh yeah?

TRACY

Brooke

25.
BROOKE
But I’m going to save it in case I
want to use it in something I
write.
EXT. TIMES SQUARE. MORNING
The commercial streets have that peculiar weekend morning
vibe. Tracy is in her outfit from the night before. Brooke
is in full workout clothes.
BROOKE
High five, sister.
AMAZING night.

That was an

TRACY
Yeah, it was...
(blurts it out)
The best of my life.
BROOKE
(looking at her phone)
I gotta go.
Brooke abruptly hugs her and leaves. Tracy watches her go
for one second and then also turns to go. She’s disappointed
but she doesn’t know why.
INT. TRACY’S DORM ROOM. MORNING
Tracy enters and goes right to her computer.
Tracy is typing very quickly, still in her jacket, her bag
still on her shoulder.
She hesitates, trying to remember something.
TRACY
What did she...say?
Talking while she types.
TRACY
Right! “He’s one of those people
that I hate except I’m in love with
him.”
RUTH
(still sleeping)
Shut up please.
CUT TO: Brooke Cardinas being typed into a Google search.

TRACY (V.O.)
Meadow DeRiggi lived exactly how a
young woman should live who wants
to spend her youth well.
CUT TO: Brooke’s Twitter page.
Random photos of Brooke.
TRACY (V.O.)

spent time like I always mean to purposefully.

EXT./INT. PIZZA PARLOR. NIGHT
Tracy tries to go to the secret bar, can’t get in.
TRACY (V.O.)
Her beauty was that rare kind that
made you want to look more like
yourself not like her.
EXT./INT. MUSIC CLUB. NIGHT
Tracy gets in, but it’s not a good band and there aren’t a
lot of people there.

She sang with the band and knew

if she did.

Being around Meadow was like being

Sorry.

INT. COLLEGE LIBRARY. DAY
Tony and Nicolette and Tracy sit at a study table.
TONY
Where were you last night, did you
get my texts?
NICOLETTE
You text her? You texted her?
TONY
About work.
TRACY
I went to check out this downtown
band at this downtown bar.
Two freshmen girls approach.
GIRL #1
Do you guys know how long you’ll
need this table?
TRACY
A long time, dude.
GIRL #2
(sighs)
Fine.
They leave.
TONY
Who were you with?
Myself.

TRACY
NICOLETTE
(to Tony)
When you said you were checking the
scores, were you texting her? Are
you sexting?
TRACY
It’s a place my sister showed me.
TONY
You don’t have a sister.

TRACY
I do. Or I will. When my mom gets
married at Thanksgiving.

Why don’t you just text her a

TONY
What’s that?
TRACY
It’s a new story I wrote. I’m
going to resubmit to the Lit

TONY
Wait, you wrote another one
already? You printed it on onion
skin?
TRACY
You can read it if you want.

I’d totally give you notes.

TRACY
No, I don’t want notes -- but I
thought about it and I actually do
have notes for you.
Oh...sure.

TONY

We see

TRACY
You write like you are imitating
someone who is free and wild and it
is so WEIRD because you aren’t at
all and it made me uncomfortable
and I think it would make EVERYONE
uncomfortable. And also, stop
trying to be funny because you
aren’t funny so it just adds to the
awkwardness. And it could be 30%
shorter, easy.
TONY

OK. Thanks.

INT. SOME HALLWAY. DAY
Tracy returns to the door with Mobius on the glass. The same
guy in a sweater vest is whittling a piece of wood. He blows
on it as he whittles. Tracy places her story in the

(to her cycling class)
HOW YOU DO ANYTHING IS HOW YOU DO
EVERYTHING AM I RIGHT?!
(and now in a low voice)
I know not enough people have told
you that you’re amazing. I know
that that’s true.

30.
Everyone loves her, she’s sort of great as a cycling
instructor.
INT. CYCLING STUDIO. AFTERWARDS
Tracy is really sweaty, still.
BROOKE
You did great!
TRACY
I feel like I just went swimming in
my clothes.
BROOKE
I’m glad you came.
You are?!

TRACY
BROOKE
Shit, I have to shower and change,
I’m late for an appointment.
INT. SALON. DAY
Brooke gets her hair blown out - Tracy sits beside her and
looks at Brooke in the mirror.
TRACY
This air conditioning is making me
freezing.
EXT. MIDTOWN STREET. DAY
Brooke, in a conservative blouse and suit, pearl earrings,
heels, holding a briefcase walks with Tracy in her jeans.
She towers over her. (Midnight Cowboy shot.)
EXT/INT. MIDTOWN RESTAURANT. DAY
They stop outside the restaurant. Brooke is suddenly very
nervous. She smooths down her blouse, her hair.
BROOKE
(pulling down the sides of
her skirt)
God, I’m packed into this pencil
skirt. How do I look?
TRACY
You look beautiful.

31.
BROOKE
But do I look professional?
(pause)
I get really nervous with the
investors. I’m usually fine with
wealthy people, it’s just when I
need something from them.
TRACY
No, it’s the opposite - they need
you and your restaurant.
BROOKE
Stavros usually does this stuff.
Maybe I shouldn’t do it. I’m not
good at it.
TRACY
(sincerely)
I think you can do anything.
Everything.
Brooke nods.
Right.

BROOKE
Kind and fearless.

She goes inside.
CUT TO: Tracy watches through the window. Brooke sits
amongst three men in suits and another powerful looking woman
in a suit. She makes them laugh.
CUT TO: Brooke meets Tracy outside.

Brooke looks relieved.

BROOKE
It’s amazing how much of business
is just stating the same things
over and over again.
TRACY
Your body language looked very selfconfident.
Thanks.
Smart.

BROOKE
You make me feel really...

Tracy beams.

INT. EMPTY RESTAURANT SPACE, BROOKLYN. DAY
Brooke shows Tracy the space. During the scene, Brooke is
changing out of her “lawyer outfit” into her “tutoring
outfit” - skinny jeans, T-shirt and Converse.

The front part would be like a shop

store or a really nice bodega candy from Europe - on Monday we
start demo and we open in April.

She leads Tracy through the

We’d also have cooking classes.
Maybe cut hair. It would be like a
community center and restaurant and
store all in one. It would be the

be. I wish I had something like
this when I was growing up.

Yeah, suburban New Jersey isn’t
great with this kind of stuff.

Each plate would be different.

TRACY
Can I be a waitress here?
Brooke opens a box.
See!

BROOKE
Look at all these plates!

TRACY
(taking in the whole
thing)
Holy shit you have a lot of plates.
BROOKE
I started collecting them so long
ago - I didn’t know why and now I
have a why!
Tracy’s been touching all of them.

33.
TRACY
This is going to be a great
restaurant.
I know!

BROOKE
TRACY
Are you going to cook, too?
BROOKE
(shakes her head)
I’ll help create the menu and pitch
in when needed. I’m not trained,
but I’m an enthusiastic home cook.
I always used to cook with my Mom.
That’s the name of the restaurant.
Mom’s. Possessive.
TRACY
(trying it out)
“Let’s go to Mom’s for dinner.”
Yeah, it totally works.
(tries again)
Can I be a waitress here?
BROOKE
I want the whole deal - I want the
dead-on-my-feet-wake-up-and-I’mforty. I’ve spent my whole life
chasing after things and knocking
at doors and I’m tired of running
towards people. I want to be the
place that people COME to.
I want
to make a home for all the knockers
and runners - I’m good at that.
I’m happy with that. I keep the
hearth. That’s a word, right?
Hearth?

The final thing she does is put

BROOKE
Don’t I look like a cute smart
graduate student?
Yeah!

TRACY

34.
BROOKE
I tutor junior high because I
didn’t get high enough SAT scores
to do SAT tutoring, but you make
way more money doing SAT. So, I’m
taking the SAT’s AGAIN so I can
make inroads into that racket.
TRACY
I’ve always been a good test taker.
BROOKE
None of this will be necessary when
the restaurant is up and running,
but I’m good that way, curating my
employment.
Brooke is rifling through her purse.
TRACY
So, um, should I - just wait here
or...
BROOKE
Oh! I thought you had to go back
to school.
Right.

TRACY
I should....

BROOKE
Do you want to stay?
TRACY
I mean, if you don’t mind...
BROOKE
Yeah, I’d invite you in but Peggy’s
Mom just got institutionalized for
bi-polar disorder and shit’s pretty
real upstairs. Tutoring is like
60% middle school math and 40% I
know too much about them.
TRACY
That’s okay, then, I’ll just go Brooke hands her keys, not listening to her.
BROOKE
You remember where my apartment is,

Tracy stands in the pasta aisle, looking at all the different
brands of pastas. She picks one up and then another. She’s
on the phone.

I just wanted to know - what kind
of pasta would you buy if you
wanted to buy a nice pasta? - Like

INT. BROOKE’S APARTMENT. LATE AFTERNOON
Tracy unpacks an enormous amount of pasta onto the counter.
TRACY (V.O.)
I remembered looking across the
river at the unblinking lights of
Manhattan apartments, wondering who
lived there.
She touches items, looks at things, takes notes. Takes a
tiny airplane and puts it in her pocket. Flips through some
SAT prep books.
TRACY (V.O.)
I was part of it now, on the fifth
floor, in a temporary commercial
apartment. There was our castle.
Our fortress. Yes! This is how I
imagined it would be: college, New
York, my whole entire life.
Brooke cooks while Tracy watches her and hands her things.
TRACY (V.O.)
But outside the windows I could
hear the hot sound of jackhammers
taking the city apart.
Brooke and Tracy eat spaghetti carbonara.
TRACY (V.O.)
In New York neighborhoods change as
quickly as the weather.
Or maybe it’s the other way around.
EXT. TIMES SQUARE. NIGHT
Tracy and Brooke walk together arm and arm.
TRACY (V.O.)
But I couldn’t warn Meadow. By the
time I noticed it, it was already
too late.

INT. BAR. NIGHT
It’s a bar bar, they’re there to get drunk. Or at least
Brooke is. Brooke looks at something on her phone. Laughs.
Holds it out for Tracy.
BROOKE
Nate dropped a gram on Instagram.
That means a picture.
Tracy smiles but less assuredly.
TRACY
It’s you guys kissing.
BROOKE
It’s already got eighty likes. All
his other recent pictures have like
fifty likes. The extra thirty must
be because of me.
TRACY
It looks like a really stylish
breathmint ad.
BROOKE
I know! Bob’s a real shutterbug.
He made his own app.
(to the bartender)
Put it on...
(very considered)
...this card.
TRACY
(to the bartender)
Did these two drinks earn me
another free hot dog?
The Bartender nods, hands her a hotdog.
BROOKE
(re: the drinks)
Drop it in the glass and chug it.
I’d love to get into the app
business. I think my Dad met your
Mom on the internet.
TRACY
Yeah, on a free dating website.
They didn’t even pay.
BROOKE
Gross. But also I guess it’s pro
forma now?

BROOKE (CONT'D)
(Tracy nods)
My Dad’s so strange. I’m sure he’s
making her convert to Catholicism,
right?
Yeah!

TRACY
What’s that about?

BROOKE
He’s real Catholic now. It’s so
boring, but it happened when my mom
got sick. She was never that into
it. He’s a geologist.
TRACY
I know. I had never met a
geologist before.
BROOKE
It’s weird that someone who studies
rocks can be really into Jesus.
TRACY
What did your Mom do?
BROOKE
She was a special education
teacher.

That’s so nice.

She was really good at it.

(looking up)
Hello.

ANNA
Hi, I don’t know if you remember
me, we went to high school
together? Anna Wheeler.
Oh YEAH!

BROOKE
ANNA
I was in the chorus of Anything
Goes.
BROOKE
Holy SHIT! Yeah! What are you
doing in the city? You live here?
ANNA
No, I’m in Tenafly. My fiance and
I went to go see a show.
Which one?

BROOKE
ANNA
Other Desert Cities.
BROOKE
Oh, that’s a piece of shit. And
the girl who replaced the lead is
AWFUL.
(to Tracy)
I used to run around with her.
Well, she was older, is older.
ANNA
We loved it.
BROOKE
Let me buy you guys a drink what
are you drinking?
ANNA
You know, that’s okay (gathering herself)
I just wanted to tell you because I
never had the courage to do it when
I was actually in high school - you
really hurt my feelings.
BROOKE
(laughs)
What?

41.
ANNA
You don’t remember?
No!

BROOKE
What did I do?

ANNA
That thing: “yep, bitter”?
BROOKE
(still genial)
I don’t know what the FUCK you’re
talking about! I always liked you.
ANNA
You and your friend Abe ABE!

BROOKE
Tracy horks her hot dog.
ANNA
You guys used to do this thing
where you’d walk up to me and touch
my skin and then like taste it and
think for a minute and then say
“yep, bitter.” And then laugh.
BROOKE
Right! We did do that, didn’t we?
We were weird.
ANNA
I was standing right there, every
single time you did it. It was
really mean, and I just wanted to
say - fuck you.
Whoa.

BROOKE
WHOA.

ANNA
The way you treated me really
messed me up for a long time.
BROOKE
Everyone is an asshole in high
school!
ANNA
You made a lot of people feel bad.
Not just me.

42.
BROOKE
I feel sorry for the thirteen year
old girl that was you but I’m not
sorry for you now.
ANNA
We were seventeen.
BROOKE
If I was thirteen I’d apologize to
you but seeing as both of us
are...in our twenties. I don’t see
the need.

Brooke and Tracy are wandering home. Tracy looks really

cold - in the time they were in the bar their coats suddenly
became not enough.
BROOKE
That’s so dramatic! What a drama
queen.
(scoffs)
I can’t believe she lives in
fucking Tenafly. What is she rich
now? How dare she talk to me that
way and be rich?

Brooke pulls out her phone.
TRACY
Maybe do it later?
BROOKE
(nods, puts the phone
away)
Yeah. I was so popular in high
school but I didn’t try AT ALL.
People just wanted to be friends
with me. I didn’t even care about
that stuff. When someone told me I
was popular I was like “Really?
Weird.”
TRACY
That’s why you were popular. The
popular kids never care. I cared
too much. Like if you want to know
all the popular kids’ business, ask
an unpopular kid. They always know
everything. Because they are the
ones who really pay attention.

I’m going to shorten that, punch it
up, and turn it into a tweet.

Brooke immediately holds her hair back and

TRACY
I’ll be okay.

We should get you a cab.

Can I...would it be OK if I slept
over again?
INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY. LATER
Tracy leans against the door-jam while Brooke tries to open
the apartment door.
TRACY
I’m pretty sure college is supposed
to be more fun than I’m having.

zoned commercial?
Yeah.

TRACY
I hope he doesn’t rat on you.
They hear louder shouting from the fire escape. The window
opens. Brooke steps inside. Her make up is smeared. She’s
been crying.

He’s pulling out of the restaurant.
INT. TRACY’S DORM ROOM. NIGHT
Tracy is on the bed, Brooke is on the floor in a makeshift
bed. Tracy’s roommate, Ruth, looks annoyed and impressed.
It’s dark.
TRACY
I hope Stavros doesn’t rat out
Kareem.
BROOKE
If I don’t have this money...my
partners will bail, they’re in
because Stavros was in. And they
can go after my savings,
everything... Rich people will
take any excuse not to spend money you can just see it in their eyes
that they don’t really want to
share life with you.
TRACY
Rich people always give out bad
Halloween candy.
BROOKE
The contractors need 20 thousand on
Monday. And then there’s the key
fee, that’s fifty - and then there
are all these industrial
refrigerators coming for another
fifteen... I need whatever that
equals by Monday. He was in for
200 thousand. Oh my fucking god.
TRACY
Isn’t there someone else you can
ask to invest?
BROOKE
I already hit up every rich person
I knew the first time around. This
was well thought through, Tracy.

47.
TRACY
I don’t know, it’s such a good
investment. I’d put money in if I
had it.
BROOKE
(suspicious)
Do you secretly have money?
TRACY
No. My mom never worked and I
think my Dad was always kind of mad
at her for that... but my parents
divorce was way easier than this.
BROOKE
(viciously)
That’s because they stopped caring
about life just entirely, it’s not
the same thing. My Mom died so
don’t even fucking start with me
about your pain.
Ruth pipes up:
RUTH
My uncle died.
BROOKE
Shut up, RUTH.
Brooke sits up.
BROOKE
I need some answers.
TRACY
(immediately)
I’m coming.
INT. WAITING AREA. NIGHT
Brooke and Tracy are waiting on a couch in an apartment.
BROOKE
I’m going to be worse off now than
I was before I started trying to
achieve stuff.
TRACY
I know what it is to want things.

48.
BROOKE
No, you don’t. You can’t really
know what it is to want things
until you’re at least thirty. And
then with each passing year it gets
more because the want is bigger and
the possibility is less. Like how
each passing year of your life
feels faster because it is a
smaller portion of your total life.
Like that but in reverse.
Everything becomes pure want.
PSYCHIC (O.S.)
OK, Brooke, I’m ready...
CUT TO: Brooke sits in front of a man, 40’s, in his
apartment. Tracy is next to Brooke looking at a chart.

And, I see flowers.
TRACY
Hard looking flowers!
BROOKE
Please, Tracy.

Yes, Spirit says you have
unfinished business with this
woman.
BROOKE
No, no, it’s finished.
it’s finished.

PSYCHIC
What happened with Mamie-Claire?
TRACY
She totally screwed Brooke over.
She married her fiance and stole
her idea.
BROOKE

I never looked back.
PSYCHIC
I am seeing this, yes.
seeing... trees...

I am

TRACY
You said she lives in Connecticut!
There are trees in Connecticut.
The Psychic looks at Brooke for affirmation.
BROOKE
Well, to be fair, there are trees
pretty much everywhere.
TRACY
You have to listen to Spirit!
Mamie-Claire can give you the
money! Hi-ho Greenwich!
BROOKE
(to the Psychic)
Really? Can we get confirmation?
Is Spirit sure of this?
PSYCHIC
The young one is right.
BROOKE
(re: Tracy)
She’s not that young. Ten...ten to
twelve years younger, we are
contemporaries, okay?

50.
PSYCHIC
You must seek out Mamie-Claire.
BROOKE
I’m so annoyed with Spirit.
PSYCHIC
The path isn’t against you it’s
just the path.
BROOKE
Right. I don’t want to be petty...
I just wasn’t brought up that way.
She’s my nemesis, but she does owe
me.

This has been a heavy weight on
you. Sometimes you have to go back
to go front.

TONY
I really don’t like to leave
Manhattan.
TRACY
(to Tony)
You’re going to want to take the
Merrit Parkway.

51.
BROOKE
I’ll bet Dylan is still in love
with me. Marrying Mamie-Claire is
like buying a cashmere sweater from
Old Navy.
Tony looks confused.
TRACY
Even if he’s not, this is a great
investment. And don’t forget she
still owes you.
BROOKE
It’s win win. Because I’m sure he
still loves me.
TONY
(annoyed)
I’m not driving you to Connecticut
to break up a marriage. I should
be in my room reading Nichomachean
Ethics.
BROOKE
Calm down rich boy.
TONY
I’m not rich.
BROOKE
Yes you are you have a car.
TONY
No, I’m not - my dad is a mechanic.
He and my uncle have a body shop.
I have this car because it was
something that he could give me.

(to Tracy)
Sorry, I think I offended your
boyfriend.
NICOLETTE
He’s not her boyfriend, he’s mine.`
BROOKE
(to Nicolette)
Why are you here?
NICOLETTE
Because Tracy made Tony drive you.

52.
BROOKE
But why did you come?
NICOLETTE
I... I had a bad experience with
adultery before. My last boyfriend
committed adultery while we were
together and I just don’t like to
let my boyfriends get too far.
BROOKE
ADULTERY? Why the fuck does it
matter? You are all eighteen!
Where is this old-person morality
coming from? There is no
“cheating” when you’re eighteen.
You should all be touching each
other all the time.
CUT TO: Tracy zones out.
TRACY
Do you ever get that feeling when
you are on a car trip that you
never want to get where you’re
going. That you never want it to
end.
Everyone is silent, thinking about it. Nicolette reaches out
to playfully touch Tony’s hair. Tony freaks.
TONY
Nicolette! You SCARED THE FUCKING
SHIT OUT OF ME!
Nicolette sits back, pissed.
TONY
(trying to make it up)
Sweety, it’s...nice, it’s just I’m
driving.
EXT. GAS STATION. DAY
Tony fills the tank while Nicolette gives him a back rub.
Tracy stretches her legs. Brooke comes out of the store
eating a Slim Jim.
BROOKE
(passing Tracy)
You should be with him, not that
goth housewife.

53.
TRACY
No, he knew me, he chose her.
BROOKE
Only because you let him. You have
to chase down the things you want.
TRACY
(shrugs)
I was just going to let it go.
BROOKE
(considering her)
Sometimes I don’t know if you are a
zen master or a sociopath.
TRACY
I’m just normal!
(taking the bait)
I’ll give him a back rub he won’t
soon forget.
Brooke gives her a half hug/squeeze, jokingly.
BROOKE
You don’t give shit, do you?
so glad you’re on my team.

I’m

Brooke wanders from the car and stretches.

Tracy watches.

Tracy watches Brooke, bent over, brushing out her hair from
the bottom, fixing her makeup.
TRACY (V.O.)
But the very things that had worked
so well for Meadow up until then
had started turning and fading.
She had no other skills, no other
way of dealing with the world. In
one instant her behaviors turned
from charming to borderline
hysteric. People could feel her
failure coming. She smelled of
something rotten. Her youth had
died and she was dragging around
the decaying carcass.
CUT TO: Entering Greenwich, Connecticut. The houses flying
by become bigger and bigger. More elegant. This is the
wealthy.
TRACY (V.O.)
I had somehow become the
pallbearer.

54.
TRACY
I’m trying to find Mamie-Claire’s
address. Does she have a different
last name?
BROOKE
I have a visual memory of it.
kind of photographic.

It’s

TRACY
Oh you’ve been here?
BROOKE
Well, I kind of stalked them once.
I was so pissed.
EXT. GREENWICH, CT. DAY
They all get out of the car.

Brooke squints.

BROOKE
Yep, this is it.
She starts to walk up to the house.

Everyone follows her.

BROOKE
Oh we’re all going? Okay, we look
crazy, but maybe that’s good.
The four of them walk up to the house and ring the doorbell.
Wait. A man answers, forties.
40’S MAN
Can I help you?
BROOKE
Hi, yes, I was wondering - is MamieClaire or Dylan in... I’m an old
friend.
40’S MAN
Wrong house.
BROOKE
Oh, which is their house? I never
come here! I live in New York.
40’S MAN
I’ll take you there.
The 40’s Man leading the way, the four of them troop over to
another house, across the big lawn and through some bushes
and trees.

55.
He walks up to the door, rings the bell.
Brooke, Tracy, Tony and Nicolette stand just behind him, out
of sight.
A woman opens the door.
Harold.

It’s Mamie-Claire.

MAMIE-CLAIRE
40’S MAN
What do you think I was doing last
night?
MAMIE-CLAIRE
I don’t know Harold, watching
kiddie porn?
40’S MAN
NO! Listening to you and your
husband shouting and not sleeping.
MAMIE-CLAIRE
So sorry we interfered with your
kiddie-porn.
40’S MAN
I am a PEDIATRICIAN.
Obviously!

MAMIE-CLAIRE
40’S MAN
Next time I hear decibel levels
like I did I’m calling the cops.
That is a promise.
He stalks off.
40’S MAN
(annoyed, to Brooke)
This is the house.
Brooke jumps out.
Hello!

BROOKE
MAMIE-CLAIRE
What - what are you doing here?
Who are these people?

56.
BROOKE
(presenting everyone one
by one)
Tracy’s Mom is marrying my Dad.
Tony drove. Nicolette is jealous.
Then a lot of unnecessary hand shaking takes place.
TRACY
Hi, I’m Tracy.
MAMIE-CLAIRE
I’m Mamie-Claire.
They shake.
Nicolette.

NICOLETTE
MAMIE-CLAIRE
Mamie-Claire.
They shake.
TONY
Tony - and wait, no don’t tell me Mamie-Claire?
Mamie-Claire ignores the joke, turns back to Brooke.
MAMIE-CLAIRE
I thought we weren’t speaking.
BROOKE
Right, I want to change that... And
I have something I really need to
talk to you and Dylan about...
MAMIE-CLAIRE
Dylan isn’t here.
BROOKE
Where is he?
MAMIE-CLAIRE
(hesitates)
He volunteers at a retirement
community. I’m in the middle of...
(hesitates again)
It’s a thing we do. It’s like a
party.
BROOKE
That’s okay.

57.
MAMIE-CLAIRE
No... it’s not...
(getting flustered, then
clarifying firmly)
It’s not for you to say okay, it’s
for me to say okay.
BROOKE
We’ll wait in the car.
MAMIE-CLAIRE
No, that’s weird.
BROOKE
People wait in cars.
MAMIE-CLAIRE
(sighs)
You and your... “posse” can hang
out in the kitchen.
INT. LIVING ROOM. DAY
Mamie-Claire leads them past pregnant and just-pregnant women
who discuss Faulkner’s “The Hamlet.
PREGNANT WOMAN #1
I think the way Faulkner uses
language is akin to the way the
modernist painters were using paint
- exploring the reality of words or
paint itself PREGNANT WOMAN #2
Only Faulkner was interested in how
that happens while characters are
ACTUALLY trying to communicate, not
just drawing attention to the
constructedness of the novel.
TONY
(to himself)
Holy shit those pregnant women are
super-smart.
Everyone is impressed.
INT. MAMIE-CLAIRE’S KITCHEN. DAY
Mamie-Claire puts down snacks for the “posse.”
MAMIE-CLAIRE
I don’t know if you’re hungry, but
this is for if you’re hungry.

58.
TRACY
This place is amazing.
Thank you.

MAMIE-CLAIRE
Brooke frowns, looking around.
BROOKE
It’s really fucking nice.
Thank you.

MAMIE-CLAIRE
TONY
Would it be OK if we sat in on your
discussion?
MAMIE-CLAIRE
(confused)
Yeah, I guess. This week’s book is
Faulkner’s “The Hamlet.” Followed
by a kind of junky biography of
Derrida, but it’s fun.
Tight.

TONY
He and Nicolette follow Mamie-Claire back into the living
room.
Tracy looks at a picture of Mamie-Claire on a boat, Brooke
leans down and whispers to her:
BROOKE
Apparently, she got recruited by
Tufts for crew and went but then
NEVER did it. I mean, that’s the
kind of person she is, just sly and
shitty.
TRACY
I would do that if I could.
wasn’t good at sports.

I

BROOKE
Yeah, I would too, but it wouldn’t
be like my CHARACTER. It would
just be something I did.
TRACY
When does that become the same
thing?

59.
BROOKE
I don’t know!
CUT TO: Brooke and Tracy wait in the kitchen. They’ve eaten
all the snacks. They’re bored. Brooke looks at her phone.
BROOKE
I didn’t know you could change the
font setting - I hate Helvetica.
Mamie-Claire enters and places plates in the sink.
stands immediately.
BROOKE
You look amazing.
MAMIE-CLAIRE
Why are all these kids with you?
BROOKE
They aren’t “kids.”
kids, we are.

If they’re

TRACY
(piping up, to MamieClaire)
I’m an associate and her almostsister.
BROOKE
I really need to talk to you...
MAMIE-CLAIRE
Okay, how long do you think you’ll
need with me, because BROOKE
How long will Dylan be “giving
back” at the old folks home? I’d
also like to talk to him.
MAMIE-CLAIRE
We’re both very busy, I have an
appointment after this...
BROOKE
Oh, come on, Mamie-Claire, that’s
stupid, you aren’t REALLY busy.
Yes!

MAMIE-CLAIRE
I am!

Brooke

60.
BROOKE
(to Tracy)
Remember this truth: It’s only
people who don’t have jobs and
don’t have anything to do that are
always fucking BUSY. Like what are
you DOING?!
MAMIE-CLAIRE
We started a community farm.
have goats.

We

NICOLETTE
(wandering in)
Goats are more sustainable.
They’re smaller.
Tony behind her.
Than what?
Cows.

BROOKE
TONY
PREGNANT WOMAN #2
(pokes her head into the
kitchen)
Um, Mamie-Claire?
MAMIE-CLAIRE
Excuse me, I have to see my guests
out.
Tony and Nicolette follow Mamie-Claire to the kitchen door:
TONY
I want to say goodbye to Karen.
NICOLETTE
Do you have a crush on Karen now?
TONY
She’s seven months pregnant!
NICOLETTE
Why do you know that?
LIVING ROOM
Nicolette and Tony are looking at a chess set. Pregnant
women are leaving. Mamie-Claire is seeing her guests out.

61.
TONY
(to Mamie-Claire)
Mamie-Claire, can me and Nicolette
play with your chess set?

Yes.

MAMIE-CLAIRE
(confused by who he even
is)
A pregnant woman sits by the door with her bag in her lap.
TONY
Everything OK, Karen?
KAREN
Yes, I’m just waiting for my
husband. He’s late to pick me up.
TONY
You want to play chess with us?
NICOLETTE
(to Tony, wanting
attention)
You have to teach me.
KAREN
No, he’ll be here any minute.
She checks her phone.

Clearly nothing.

KITCHEN
Mamie-Claire comes back into the kitchen cleaning up.
BROOKE
Sorry, I got started on the wrong
foot there - I meant to say, I’ve
been missing you as a friend and...
And?

MAMIE-CLAIRE
TRACY
She has a very exciting business
opportunity for you.
BROOKE
And I wanted to bring it to you and
Dylan as a peace offering.
I really think you’re going to want
to hear about this...

62.
MAMIE-CLAIRE
The last time I saw you you were
hiding in the bushes and then you
started incoherently yelling at me
and my husband about how we had
ruined your life and the time
before that you were throwing up at
my wedding.
BROOKE
Which is why I am bringing you this
exciting business opportunity!
Mamie-Claire goes into the dining room. Tracy nods at her,
like “keep going!” They follow Mamie-Claire.
BROOKE
I would like to offer you a share
in a restaurant I’m starting.
Why?

MAMIE-CLAIRE
BROOKE
Because it is all set up and ready
to go and I already have the
ability to draw a crowd and it’ll
just be... perfect. You’ll love
it. So will Dylan.
TRACY
There are lots of other investors.
BROOKE
But not so many that it would
dilute your investment.
MAMIE-CLAIRE
So why are you here?
BROOKE
Well, there was a slight snafu with
one of our people which allowed a
very coveted spot to open up, which
I am offering only to you guys...
Mamie-Claire considers.
MAMIE-CLAIRE
It’s not really a good time for me
to get involved with a business...
Why?

BROOKE

63.
MAMIE-CLAIRE
We’re trying to have a baby...
KAREN
You’ll never regret it.
MAMIE-CLAIRE
Thanks, Karen.
BROOKE
It’s just money, you don’t have to
do any of the work, you just get
the glory and the profit and the
satisfaction of being involved with
something awesome.
MAMIE-CLAIRE
I don’t think Dylan would buy into
it. We recently lost money
purchasing taxi cab medallions.
BROOKE
I don’t want to overstep my bounds
here but I think you might be wrong
- when is he coming back?
MAMIE-CLAIRE
I really need to focus on having
children - this isn’t part of what
I need to focus on. No, just...
Can I just say no?
Brooke gets furious.
BROOKE
No, you cannot “just say no.” Why
not?
MAMIE-CLAIRE
I don’t need a why.
BROOKE
The money means NOTHING to you!
Look at all this shit, this house
that patio furniture. You can
spare it, you wouldn’t even miss
it!
TRACY
And it really would make a profit!
No.

MAMIE-CLAIRE
You can’t make me.

64.
BROOKE
Yes, I can because you OWE me.
TRACY
(trying to stop her)
Um, Brooke...
MAMIE-CLAIRE
(evenly)
I don’t owe you.
BROOKE
For Dylan because that was just
skanky but really for the T-shirts you stole my T-shirt idea and you
know it.
MAMIE-CLAIRE
I did not steal your idea. It was
my idea and you were there when I
had it.
BROOKE
No! That’s so wrong - I remember
like the minute I said “what if
this flower was, like, TOUGH.” And
then we started riffing but I SAID
IT FIRST.
MAMIE-CLAIRE
(calmly)
No, you didn’t.
Brooke screams.
BROOKE
You are so annoying when you get
calm voice!
Brooke storms off into the backyard.
sees two cats.

Stops short when she

BROOKE
Are these my fucking cats?!
MAMIE-CLAIRE
They’re mine. I paid for their cat
surgery so they’re mine.
BROOKE
Did my cats die and you didn’t tell
me? Are these replacement cats?

65.
MAMIE-CLAIRE
No! They are the same goddamn
cats!
Brooke stares at the cats hard and then stomps outside.
Tracy wants to go after her but follows Mamie-Claire into the
living room.
Tony and Nicolette play chess. The pregnant woman still sits
by the door checking her phone periodically. Tony thinks
hard before a move. He moves his rook-KAREN
If you do that, your knight is
vulnerable.
What?

TONY
Oh...thanks.

NICOLETTE
You took your finger off it, you
made the move.
Mamie-Claire enters.

Tracy behind her.

TONY
“I took my finger off it?”
I playing here Deep Blue?
He looks at Karen for a laugh.

Who am

Doesn’t get it.

MAMIE-CLAIRE
Karen, come inside, have a glass of
wine.
KAREN
Oh, no, I’m fine.

He’ll be here.

TRACY
(indignant to MamieClaire)
So you deny it? That you profited
from her idea that you stole?
MAMIE-CLAIRE
No, I don’t deny it. She’s right.
The T-shirts were her idea.
TRACY
Then why did you just say that?!
MAMIE-CLAIRE
I like making her mad. It’s so
easy.

66.
TRACY
You took her idea. That’s not
just, Mamie-Claire.
MAMIE-CLAIRE
No, I tried to include her. I set
up a meeting with people and she
never showed up. And then she
stopped speaking to me when me and
Dylan got married so I figured I
could just go do it.
TRACY
So it’s her fault.
MAMIE-CLAIRE
No... She is right that I stole a
lot of her life ideas. I really am
not as creative as she is. But she
never would have used them. She
has no follow through.
TRACY
So it’s... no one’s fault.
Obviously.

MAMIE-CLAIRE
That’s always true.

TRACY
You know the restaurant is going to
be really great. She’s following
through with that. If she’s
allowed to.
Tracy leaves to go find Brooke.
Check.

At the chess table:

NICOLETTE
TONY
Wait, what? No it isn’t.
NICOLETTE
(smiling)
Check.
Tony stands, pretends he’s being rational.
TONY
I don’t want to play anymore.
NICOLETTE
Oh come on!

67.
TONY
I don’t feel like playing right
now.
NICOLETTE
You can’t quit right before I’m
going to win-TONY
I’m just not in the mood.

Oh, really?
DAD
No... We called it off last night.
It’s for the best. I don’t really
know her.
Yeah.

BROOKE
DAD
She wasn’t committed to the church,
either. I think that was all
forced.
BROOKE
Sure, sure.
DAD
Are you okay?
BROOKE
Yes, I just... You’re really not
doing it? I thought you guys were
really symbiotic. Wasn’t it a web
algorithm that got you together?
She seems amazing.
DAD
You never even met Stevie.
BROOKE
Through you, I met her.

I don’t

Tears run down Brooke’s face.
BROOKE
Don’t just bail. That’s what the
Cardinases always do, move on to
something else. Hang in there.
DAD
Frankly I’m surprised you’re so
invested in this. Believe me, it’s
for the best.
BROOKE
(wiping her face)
I have to go.
(MORE)

69.
BROOKE (CONT'D)
I have a really important business
meeting. I love you.
DAD
We can do Thanksgiving at my house
if you want - since there won’t be
a wedding.
BROOKE
Nah, I’ll probably just end up
doing something depressing but
young.
DAD
Home is only a bus ride away.
Is it?

BROOKE
Just kidding, it is.

There is a silence between them for a second.
BROOKE
So what does this make me and
Tracy?
DAD
Who’s Tracy?
BROOKE
Never mind.
DAD
Oh, oh, right, her daughter nothing, I guess.
INT. MAMIE-CLAIRE’S DEN. DAY
Tracy is looking through an old datebook in the den. She
picks up a 1970’s subway token and puts in her pocket.

He

TRACY
Let me have a sip.
She takes the glass from him.

He looks at her.

TONY
How much longer do you think we’ll
be here?
TRACY
I don’t know, however long it
takes. After Dylan comes home
maybe.
TONY
What are you really trying to
accomplish here?
TRACY
(looking around the room)
I’m enjoying this really stylish
house. When you live in suburbia
you have to really like being in
your house.
TONY
That’s not what I - what are you
doing with this whole thing?
Nicolette appears in the doorway for a second and then
retreats, listening.
TRACY
I want Brooke to get her
restaurant. I’m helping out.
Tony goes to his backpack, which was thrown on the couch.
Opens it and retrieves the pages she had given him.
TONY
I read your story, by the way.
(he holds up the pages)
Brooke is the woman in your piece.
You’re collecting material.
TRACY
Did you like it?

71.
TONY
(evasive)
That’s not what we’re talking
about.
TRACY
Why are you here?
TONY
(vaguely)
You needed a ride.

You forced me.

Tracy quickly walks over to Tony.
TRACY
How does it feel to be forced?
TONY
It feels...uncomfortable.
Tracy puts her face close to his.

She removes his glasses.

TRACY
And how do you feel now?
TONY
Still uncomfortable.
Tracy kisses Tony passionately on the mouth.

You want other people to do the
things that you can’t so you can
blame them.
TONY
You used to be so nice.
TRACY
I’m the same. I’m just the same in
another direction now.
Tony and Tracy leave. Nicolette enters, goes to Tony’s
backpack and takes out the story.
MAMIE-CLAIRE (O.S.)
YOU’RE HOME!
INT. MAMIE-CLAIRE’S HOUSE. DAY
Dylan, a round annoyed-looking blonde man, is fixing a drink
and doing dishes and Mamie Claire is trying to really hug him
with her face in his neck.
DYLAN
I don’t like it when you try to
force affection onto me.
MAMIE-CLAIRE
I’m just trying to hug you.
DYLAN
Do you have to put your face so
close to mine?
MAMIE-CLAIRE
It’s nice....
DYLAN
You know how upset I get when I
visit the home...
MAMIE-CLAIRE
I want you to share it with me.
DYLAN
Rosella and Lorene may not even be
ALIVE next time I’m there, okay?

DYLAN (CONT'D)
Just keep your face a little away
while I process that.
MAMIE-CLAIRE
(pouting)
Fine.
Dylan looks up -- he clocks Tony, Tracy and Karen, the
abandoned Pregnant Woman, at the top of the stairs.
DYLAN
Who are all these people?! MC, why
do you never tell me who is in the
house?
KAREN
I wondered if I could have some
water.
MAMIE-CLAIRE
Of course, Karen.
She goes to retrieve a glass.
DYLAN
Oh, hi Karen, I don’t mean you.
TONY
(reaching out his hand)
Tony, nice to meet you. Beautiful
house sir.
DYLAN
(confused)
Thank you.
TONY
Have you seen a girl about this
high (demonstrates with his
hand)
- that’s my girlfriend.

No, uh, there’s more of you?
Tracy steps in a little:
I’m Tracy.

In a minute.

Karen sits on the stool.

Tony looks distraught.

Can I have a snack?

Mamie-Claire gestures to the refrigerator. Tony opens the
freezer and fridge stands in front of it. Dylan considers
Brooke. Mamie-Claire watches.
DYLAN
Brooke -- I haven’t seen you in a
second.
BROOKE
I know, right?
DYLAN
What brings you to the burbs?
We were--

BROOKE
MAMIE-CLAIRE
Brooke needs money.

No, I don’t “need money” - I come

It’s a good one.

I’m sorry to say it but you guys

MAMIE-CLAIRE
They’re not her students.

I’ll walk you out.

It’s

Mamie-Claire leaves through the door toward the living room.
No one follows.
BROOKE
They’re my friends.
DYLAN
Always running with a young crowd.
TRACY
She’s starting a restaurant.

BROOKE
I can’t wait to tell you about it.
Mamie-Claire reenters, realizing no one followed.
MAMIE-CLAIRE
Dylan, let’s not do this. She
already lost her shit once.
DYLAN
What’s the restaurant?
Dylan starts doing the dishes/loading the dishwasher.
MAMIE-CLAIRE
Brooke, this is uncomfortable.
Dylan doesn’t want to do this.
DYLAN
(to Mamie-Claire)
You don’t know what I want. I know
you see me a certain way, but I’m
not just some square. I saw
Nirvana live and this was way
before Nevermind.
TRACY
(piping in)
You seem really cool to me.
DYLAN
I DJed at my college radio station,
the 2AM slot. We played Mudhoney,
Superchunk, Trip Shakespeare, I
mean...
MAMIE-CLAIRE
No one wants to hear about your
glory days in college radio, Dylan,
OK.
TRACY/BROOKE
I do./I do.
DYLAN
(back to Mamie-Claire)
I play this part for you. I play
this guy wearing a fleece, but I’m
not just some asshole bankrolling
your fitness goals.
MAMIE-CLAIRE
I’ve gotten really into
triathalons.

TRACY
Brooke teaches cycling.
So cool.

DYLAN
MAMIE-CLAIRE
No, I only like cycling when it’s
combined with running and swimming.
DYLAN
(to Brooke)
Why did you think of us?
MAMIE-CLAIRE
Because we “owe” her!
BROOKE
Because you’re into cool things.
DYLAN
We are! You guys want to smoke
some weed?
He opens the freezer.
DYLAN
I have some frozen weed. MC,
where’s that weed Jason gave us?
MAMIE-CLAIRE
You’ve just said “weed” like
fifteen times.
DYLAN
(head in the freezer)
MC??? Did that kid take my weed!?
MAMIE-CLAIRE
NO! No one has touched it. It
should be next to the Chipwiches.

Are you sick?

No, I’m healthy.

NICOLETTE (O.S.)
You sound like you’re eating

I have a Chipwich for you.
NICOLETTE (O.S.)

You brought me a Chipwich?
TONY
I can get you another one.

NICOLETTE
LEAVE ME ALONE!
Nicolette reads the story on the sink counter.
TRACY (V.O.)
It was clear that the thing that
Meadow wanted most in the world the thing that she wanted to define
her, to absolve her from the
struggle of explaining herself,
to give her a place to put her time
and talents - her everything - the
restaurant.
Tony pounds on the door.
TRACY (V.O.)
It was clear that it would never
happen. The most surprising thing
was that Meadow was actually
surprised by it. She could see the
whole world with painful accuracy
but couldn’t see herself or her
fate.
TONY (O.S.)
Baby, come out!

Brooke finds herself standing next to Karen.
TRACY (V.O.)
The most surprising thing was that

And because I was in love with her,
I decided I couldn’t see it either.
The conversations overlap.

That doesn’t have to be a permanent

BROOKE
I know that.
KAREN
You can still go to college.
DYLAN
(head still in the
freezer)
We’ll get lifted and you’ll tell us
about this venture.
Dylan reemerges holding a Chipwich.
DYLAN
Do any of you kids know how to make
an apple bong?
MAMIE-CLAIRE
(nearly apoplectic)
Nobody knows how to make an apple
bong!
Tony comes back:
I do.

TONY
DYLAN
(suspicious)
Did you take my herb?
No.

TONY

81.
DYLAN
I’ll get you an apple.
TRACY
Why don’t we all sit down somewhere
comfortable and listen to what
Brooke has to say...
Yes.
What?

DYLAN
You’ll pitch us.
BROOKE

DYLAN
That’s what you do. If someone
wants something. They pitch. Come
pitch us on our media stage!
Dylan, Tracy, Tony and Brooke all troupe down the hall.
Mamie-Claire hurries behind:

We just ran Apocalypto on Blu Ray.
Stunning. Stunning. I’ve gotten
very into vinyl.
TRACY
I’m into compressed MP3’s.

Just

DYLAN
I have a great early Mother Love
Bone EP that would be perfect for
this occasion.
BROOKE
Records are so warm.
Brooke is suddenly yanked out of the line of people, by MamieClaire who stands in the dark in the guest bathroom:
MAMIE-CLAIRE
(intense whisper)
I want you to know that I really
love Dylan. I love his blonde hair
and his beard. I know you only
loved him for his money but I love
him as a person and I also love him
for his money but not in that
order. I’m committed to being a
happier person. Do you understand?
She releases Brooke back out into the hallway.

82.
LIVING ROOM
Dylan, Mamie-Claire, Tony, Karen and Tracy sit on the couch
in front of an elevated stage which is usually used to
project movies.
Brooke stands behind a curtain.
the curtain slowly opens.

Tracy presses a button and

Brooke appears before them. Brooke backs up and kind of gets
a little presentational about the whole thing.
BROOKE
Umm, well...it’s a restaurant, but
also like where you cut hair...
(hesitates)
Can I start over?
Of course.

DYLAN
We’re old friends.

Murmurs of “yes, of course.”
BROOKE
Okay, great.
She does a weird “rewinding” type action.

Everyone stares.

BROOKE
I was, that was pretend rewind.
Like...
Then she does it again.
BROOKE
(breath)
So...it would have big heavy wooden
tables and chairs and...
Suddenly a projection of the red FBI warning from a DVD
appears across Brooke’s body. She hesitates.
Dylan pulls the remote control from under his body.
Sorry.

DYLAN
He shuts off the image.

everyone wishes they had been

Tracy can’t help but pipe in from the

TRACY
No one who comes there will want to
take out their cell phones because
it won’t feel that way. It would
be like taking out your cell phone
in the woods - totally wrong.
DYLAN
It’s so rude. I concur.
TRACY
Yeah. It will always feel like
fall inside - even on hot summer
nights with all the windows open.
BROOKE
Loaves of bread that people tear
off pieces. It would be the kind
of place where at 2AM the chef and
the wait-staff would come out and
eat something simple they fixed
themselves with the remaining
guests and open a bottle of good
wine.
TRACY
(standing up)
It would be the best of capitalism.
What politicians pretend they mean
when they say “small business.”
BROOKE
We would resist doing too many
pieces in the Times and stuff
because we’d want it to stay
honest. They would want us to
expand and open another one and
maybe we eventually would but we
wouldn’t try to re-create the first
one, it would be a totally new
thing. And if I ever had kids they
would walk there after school and
do their homework in a corner
table. They’d grow up around all
these wonderful adults TRACY
Chefs and actors who are waiters it would be a big funny family and
they’d never be lonely.

84.
BROOKE
This could all be something you
guys share in - you’d be their
auntie and uncle - part of the life
and food. And eventually I’d train
someone younger than myself to run
the day to day so I could go up to
Maine with my family in the summers
and have the kids dive for lobsters
and everyone would be so warm and
happy inside knowing that in their
life they had participated in
something that was only good.
Silence. Tracy is kind of emotional.
Karen is sobbing.
Wow.

Everyone applauds.

TONY
Dylan walks up to Brooke, kissing her on each cheek,
pretending to be speechless.
DYLAN
(to the group)
You know, I lived in the City for
many years. Before I started at
Goldman, I was teaching at Baruch

television shows about.

I was quite beautiful.

Really? I wasn’t sure you had
heard me those times.
BROOKE
I hear everything.
DYLAN
How much do you need?
BROOKE
It’s 200 total but I calculated we
need forty-two point five on
Monday.
TRACY
For refrigeration.
DYLAN
Forty-two point five stacks, huh?
TONY
What are stacks?
KAREN
A thousand?
MAMIE-CLAIRE
I thought “stacks” meant a hundred.
DYLAN
I’m pretty sure a stack is a
thousand.
BROOKE
I think a dime is a thousand.
(cutting to the chase)
Nevermind, you’d do that?
DYLAN
I want to help you.
The door bell rings.

Karen springs off her stool.

KAREN
That’s Ted! Bye everyone.
Bye.

EVERYONE
KAREN
(to Brooke)
Good luck with your restaurant!

86.
She hurries out.
MAMIE-CLAIRE
Dylan, this is really something for
us to talk about privately.
DYLAN
We need fresh drinks.
He starts for the kitchen.

Brooke follows.

KAREN (O.S.)
Umm, Mamie-Claire! Can you come
here please?
MAMIE-CLAIRE
Can it wait, Karen?
No!

KAREN (O.S.)
Mamie-Claire hesitates, torn between keeping and eye of Dylan
and going to Karen, and then runs to Karen.
CUT TO: Harold is at the door.

Karen stands there, confused.

KAREN
It’s not Ted.

I’m blowing Harold so he doesn’t

just going to have to go look at
his boat collection.

HAROLD
(stepping inside)
I can’t remember the last time I

MAMIE-CLAIRE
I don’t think you’ve ever been over

I

TRACY
She’s angry about the chess game?
TONY
Yeah, I think so. I’m mostly in
touch with my feminine side but
then I guess not though because I
don’t understand her right now.
TRACY
Did you... did you want to be with
me ever?
TONY
I don’t want to get into this...
TRACY
No, I’m not going to kiss you.
Just a question.
Tony considers:

88.
TONY
Yeah, I liked you, but I love
Nicolette and honestly... I just
never saw you that way.
Why?

TRACY
TONY
You seemed... I need someone I can
love, not keep up with.
TRACY
(nodding)
Sometimes I really think I’m just
smarter and better than everyone
else. Not necessarily with math or
science or whether something is
east or west but pretty much with
everything else. And if I could
just figure out my look I’d be the
most beautiful woman in the world
too.
TONY
Sometimes I think I’m a genius and
I wish I could just fast-forward my
life to the part where everyone
knows it.
Tony holds up the completed apple bong.

It’s beautiful.

KITCHEN
Brooke has followed Dylan into the kitchen, he’s fixing a
drink.
DYLAN
I have to say, I’m impressed
Brooke. It takes a lot of moxie to
start a restaurant.
Thanks.

BROOKE
DYLAN
You’re doing it, babe. You’re out
there, doing something besides
amassing and hoarding money.
BROOKE
If I could figure out how to amass
and hoard money, I’d do it.

89.
DYLAN
You could have married me or a
dozen other guys but you wanted to
be your own person.
BROOKE
Yeah, no, I’m over that now.
Dylan laughs.

He moves toward her.

She moves in.

DYLAN
You’re funny because you don’t know
you’re funny.
BROOKE
I know I’m funny. There’s nothing
I don’t know about myself. That’s
why I can’t do therapy.
They’re close now. He pushes a strand out of her face and
behind her ear. Brooke is going with it.
DYLAN
MC and I see a woman in New Haven.
BROOKE
Oh...you guys see a therapist?
Like a tune up?
DYLAN
More like a death watch. She’s
totally on my side. She basically
thinks Mamie-Claire is holding me
back and I should just leave her.
BROOKE
Your couple’s therapist said that?
DYLAN
In so many words.

Yeah, we’re

(sadly)
Mamie-Claire said you were trying

Oh no, I’m sorry--

DYLAN
No, it’s liberating.

I feel great.

BROOKE
(freaked out)
Yay...
DYLAN
I miss New York, man. I miss you.
I look you up periodically on the
internet. You look hot as hell in
those party pictures.

Oh...do I? Which party? Sometimes
I look like I have fat arms.
He takes another step forward.

I like fat arms.

DYLAN
Here’s what I’m going to do for

stacks or dimes and pay back the
other investors, whatever they’re

Brooke, realizing, nods.
DYLAN
We’ll put it up for rent
immediately, cool neighborhood?
BROOKE
(almost inaudible)

DYLAN
Oh, come on! The coolest. Yeah,
we’ll turn it over no problem.

91.
DYLAN (CONT'D)
Because let’s face it having a
restaurant is like having a kid
with a drug problem.
It’s...just...it’s really draining.
BROOKE
(crushed)
You’re giving me money to not start
a restaurant?
DYLAN
First of all - I’m saving you. If
you started the restaurant, you’d
be back here in a year asking for
five times this.
BROOKE
Not if it was successful -DYLAN
What are the odds?
He pushes a hair away from her face.

He’s close to her now.

DYLAN
You’re as beautiful as ever.
Whatever you’re doing it’s working.
No.

BROOKE
No, it isn’t.

Brooke hesitates.

Dylan grins.

Tracy enters.
TRACY
Did you ever find the pot? Tony
just made a beautiful apple bong.
DYLAN
We’ll have to, because some
celebrating is in order.
(putting his arm around
Brooke)
I think we may have reached a deal.
BROOKE
(shaking off her
disappointment)
Yes... Dylan made a proposition.
DYLAN
I’m going to give her money
immediately.

92.

Yay!

TRACY
MAMIE-CLAIRE (O.S.)
You’re giving her money?
Mamie-Claire enters.

Dylan takes his arm off of Brooke.

DYLAN
Who was at the door?
MAMIE-CLAIRE
Harold. He’s giving himself a tour
of the house.
DYLAN
Where’s Karen?
MAMIE-CLAIRE
I don’t fucking know. You’re
giving her money??? This is our
decision. Not yours.
DYLAN
I’m not giving her 200 grand, don’t
worry, I’m just bailing her out of
her current situation.
Tracy looks at Brooke.
TRACY
And then for the whole restaurant?
BROOKE
(trying to be brave)
No... I won’t do the restaurant
now. It’s just gotten too crazy.
Oh.

TRACY
DYLAN
(to Tracy)
You believe in her, don’t you?
Tracy nods.

Brooke watches her.

DYLAN
This is a good result, this is even
better than getting the restaurant.
Less financial uncertainty.

93.
BROOKE
He’s right. I think I even feel a
little relieved.
TRACY
“Mom’s” wasn’t about money.
DYLAN
Well, I don’t think anyone starts
anything with the dream of NOT
making money.
TRACY
Do they not?
MAMIE-CLAIRE
Why would you give her money?
DYLAN
It’s my money. I make it. I can
do what I want with it. Just like,
you have your T-shirt money, you
can do what you want with that.

But I... we’re married.

An unspoken “Thanks.”

TRACY
What will you do?

I’ll figure it out.

I always do.

TRACY
I’m so impressed by you and worried
for you at the same time.
She hugs Brooke.
TRACY
I’m so glad you’re my sister.
Brooke is about to say something when they HEAR SHOUTING.
INT. MAMIE-CLAIRE’S LIVING ROOM. IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING
Dylan, Mamie-Claire, Brooke and Tracy enter.
Tony are arguing.

Nicolette and

TONY
I love YOU!
NICOLETTE
Don’t lie to my face and stab me in
the back butter boy!
TONY
Hey, that’s mean...
She sees Tracy.
NICOLETTE
You’re stealing my boyfriend!
You’re cuckholding me!
She starts hitting Tracy.

Harold and Karen enter.

NICOLETTE
You bitch whore!
Guys!

BROOKE
TONY
(to Brooke)
She just started attacking her!
HAROLD
(walking in)
What IS it about this house?
Everyone screams.
MAMIE-CLAIRE
Please stop it!
Brooke helps Mamie-Claire pull Nicolette off Tracy.

95.
NICOLETTE
(still struggling)
She’s stealing my boyfriend!
I am not!

TRACY
TONY
I resisted! I resisted!
BROOKE
Chill the fuck out.
DYLAN
Ladies, ladies.
KAREN
(re: her stomach)
I don’t like shouting around the
baby.
MAMIE-CLAIRE
(to Karen)
Is that a real thing?
TONY
I’m right here, she’s not stealing
anything...
NICOLETTE
It’s NOT just that! There’s also
THIS!
The pulls a wrinkled stack of papers out of her pants.
BROOKE
What the fuck is that?
KAREN
Or cursing.
NICOLETTE
Tracy knows what it is. I’ll give
you a hint: it’s onion skin.
CLOSE on Tracy.

Nicolette points at her.

NICOLETTE
(pointing her finger)
She’s a HOMEWRECKER and a bad
person.

96.
TRACY
(to Brooke)
It’s not you... It’s just inspired.
You make me want to write.
MAMIE-CLAIRE
This is so nerdy.
DYLAN
Who wouldn’t want to write a story
about Brooke?
MAMIE-CLAIRE
(raising her hand)
Me. I wouldn’t.
TONY

Baby, I resisted.

If it’s about

DYLAN
I’d like to, too.
MAMIE-CLAIRE

You don’t read fiction.

97.
DYLAN
When it’s about my friends I do.
TRACY
(to Brooke)
Oh, it’s not really you, but it’s
very funny, the character that
Nicolette and Tony misconstrued as
you is a very funny character.
BROOKE
(not thrilled with this)
Funny? What does it say?
TRACY
It’s not funny. It’s just...it’s
not you.
NICOLETTE
(to Brooke)
Do you live in an apartment that’s
zoned commercial?
Brooke hesitates.
BROOKE
Gimme that story.
She snatches it out of Nicolette’s hands.
CUT TO: Brooke reads with Mamie-Claire, Karen, Harold and
Dylan all reading over her shoulder. Tony and Nicolette also
hover in the background, reading here and there. Tracy
watches nervously from across the room.
Brooke starts to turn the page. Everyone indicates they’re
not finished with that page yet.
CUT TO: Brooke turns the final page.
She is FURIOUS.

She looks at Tracy.

TRACY
It wasn’t meant to be hurtful - I
didn’t mean to hurt you, Brooke.
BROOKE
(shaking with fury)
You don’t get to decide what’s
hurtful and not hurtful.
TRACY
I can only tell you my intention.

98.
BROOKE
You wrote this after ONE night with
me? ONE?!
TRACY
I guess so, yeah, it felt longer.
BROOKE
You think I’m a rotting carcass?
That I’m doomed to failure???
TRACY
No! It’s fiction that’s why it’s
fiction...
BROOKE
So much of this “fiction” did NOT
happen this way. Karen, you’re a
lawyer. I’m going to sue you until
you have NOTHING.
TRACY
I’m just writing from my life...
BROOKE
No, this isn’t your life!
TRACY
But I was there that night.
BROOKE
NO! I was going to have that night
anyway, you never were!
TRACY
But I did have it though.
BROOKE
You joined my life - you needed a
place to go and I invited you in
and then you stole my life. You’re
a LEECH. A BLOODSUCKER.
TRACY
You loved being admired by me, you
loved it, you loved having lessons
to impart...
BROOKE
I DIDN’T ASK FOR YOU.
Tracy looks for support from Tony and Nicolette.

TRACY
Brooke, you know great plays,
right? - how would it have been if
Tennessee Williams hadn’t used
people he knew, there wouldn’t be
any plays, there wouldn’t BROOKE
I DON’T GIVE A SHIT BECAUSE I AM
NOT A FRIEND OF TENNESSEE WILLIAMS.
TRACY
You took something I said and made
a tweet about it! What about that?
BROOKE
That’s different! You were right
there! You knew I was Twittering,
it wasn’t some sneaky shitty thing do you want me to credit you? Or
no I’ll just delete it.
TRACY
That’s not the point I’m asking you
to empathize.
BROOKE
It’s my least popular tweet anyway!
TRACY
Stop talking about Twitter, it’s so
awkward!
BROOKE
You are much more of an asshole
than you initially appear.
I agree.

NICOLETTE
BROOKE
(looking again at the
story)
And...you think I haven’t dealt
with the pain of my mother’s death?
I deal with it all the time, I talk
about it all the time.

You talk about it all the time, but
you never talk about HER. You just
throw out that she died and that
shuts everyone up.

TRACY
Are you fucking kidding me?
MAMIE-CLAIRE
And I want you to answer these
questions, not for our
satisfaction, but for your own.

right to choose?
TRACY
Yes, what does that MAMIE-CLAIRE
Excuse me, I’m not done.

BROOKE
She’s not done, bitch!
MAMIE-CLAIRE
Brooke, please. Two: What do you

clinics would think of your story?
TRACY
There isn’t even an abortion in
this story!
BROOKE
No you just portray women as crazy
desperate gold diggers!

MAMIE-CLAIRE
Will you draw up a contract,

KAREN
Yes, and in the meantime, I’m going
to ask you to rewrite the story and
give Brooke the rewritten story.
I’ll give you my email and you can

KAREN
Sure, CC me.

yesterday.
TRACY
I’m not going to do any of this
stuff. You’re my sister and I love
you but I stand by what I did.

103.
BROOKE
Guess what, bitch? My dad isn’t
going to marry your slutty atheist
mother so we’re not sisters. We
never will be. We’re nothing to
each other.
Mamie-Claire tucks her folded paper into Tracy’s pocket.
MAMIE-CLAIRE
There are ten questions there.

But Brooke won’t look at her.
EXT. MAMIE-CLAIRE’S HOUSE. EVE

She smokes from the apple bong.

Tracy rides on the train. She opens Mamie-Claire’s
questions. She reads them to herself.

Oh, honey!

Tracy sits next to her on the

MOM
The Catholicism thing has been kind
of crazy and he kind of -- I just
saw a side of him that I didn’t

really know someone...
Oh...

TRACY

MOM
I’m sorry, I know you liked Brooke.
He told me that she worships you,
she kept talking about how smart
you are, how interesting...
Tracy starts crying.
MOM
Oh, honey, don’t cry, you can still
be friends...
TRACY
I went -- I went through a breakup
too.
MOM
You didn’t tell me you were dating
anyone.
I know.

TRACY
She cries harder.
MOM
Oh my sweet girl.

Do you want to

TRACY
No, it’s too late now anyway.
Mom rubs Tracy’s back.
MOM
I know this is crappy timing, but I
need to take a vacation, and I got
the deposit back for the flowers
and Colleen told me to come with
her family to the Caribbean over
Thanksgiving, and Trace, I need it.
TRACY
Yeah, that sounds nice, Stevie.
MOM
So you’re okay, for Thanksgiving,
not coming home? I’m sure your
father would love to have you...
TRACY
Oh, I didn’t put that together yes, I’m fine. I’ll be fine. Are
you okay?

I’m sad.

MOM
I’m very sad.

But I’ll

TRACY
I wish it had worked, even though I
didn’t really know him.
MOM
Me too, Baby Tracy.
INT. DORM ROOM. NIGHT
Tracy’s sleeping. She looks peaceful. We HEAR a door open,
footsteps and suddenly a pie is jammed in her face.
Tracy screams.

And screams.

And screams.

The members of the Mobius Lit Club all stop in their tracks.
The boy in the sweater vest says:
You’re in.

SWEATER VEST

INT. PSYCHIC WAITING AREA. DAY
Tracy waits.
INT. PSYCHIC’S APARTMENT. DAY
Tracy sits across from the Psychic.
TRACY
Sometimes I worry that I’m a bad
person. That I’m one of those
people who essentially has no
conscience.

106.
PSYCHIC
Spirit says that you need to find
your home in yourself.
The Psychic suddenly takes her hand:
PSYCHIC
Spirit says that you haven’t
dropped into your body yet.
TRACY
If I’m not in my body, where am I?
PSYCHIC
Five feet to the left and unhappy.
EXT. HUDSON RIVER. DAY
Tracy hurls her briefcase into the water.
INT. OFFICE. DAY
Tracy sits in front of the Advisor.
TRACY
If a person wanted to start their
own club, how would a person go
about it?
ADVISOR
Well, I think it’s pretty much done
for this semester, but you could
put in an application for funding
for next semester...
INT. TONY’S DORM ROOM. DAY
A knock on the door.

Tony answers it.

TRACY
Hey, can I come in?
OK.

TONY
Tracy sits on the floor.
TRACY
You going home for Thanksgiving?
TONY
No, going to Baltimore with
Nicolette.

107.

Oh...nice.

TRACY
TONY
Her dad fries a turkey apparently.
You?
Nah.

TRACY
She hands Tony a couple of pieces of paper.
TRACY
It’s an application.

Two.

TONY
I don’t want to join Mobius.
had enough rejection.

I’ve

TRACY
It’s not for Mobius. I quit the
briefcase club. You were right,
they’re self-appointed douche bags.
I’m starting my own zine and I’m
not saying you’re in, but I am
saying I’d be very interested in
getting your and Nicolette’s
application.
Tony stands, he thinks about this for a moment.
TONY
I’ll fix us some screwdrivers.
OK.

TRACY

Tracy goes by the restaurant.

For Let.

INT. BROOKE’S APARTMENT BUILDING. HALLWAY. AFTERNOON
Tracy knocks on a door.
Hello.

Kareem, in a tie, answers.

KAREEM

108.
TRACY
Hi - I’m sorry to bother you on
Thanksgiving, but I met you once I went through your window? It was
in the middle of the night...
Yeah...

KAREEM
TRACY
I was with Brooke.
KAREEM
You’re her sister, right?
TRACY
Well, I was going to be. Do you
have a number for her? The old one
isn’t working...
I don’t--

KAREEM
TRACY
Anyway - I was going to ask you: do
you know where she went?
Kareem indicates for Tracy to follow him. She passes through
a cozy apartment. The table is set for the holiday. A
couple of kids run through.
KAREEM
Her front door is still bolted
shut.
They reach the window.

Kareem opens it.

KAREEM
She’s upstairs.
EXT. FIRE ESCAPE. DAY
Tracy climbs the fire escape.
looks through the glass.

She gets to the top window and

The place is mostly empty save for stacked boxes and
suitcases.
Brooke walks into the room and places some books into a box.
She wears her red pants. Tracy knocks. Brooke looks up and
comes to the window.
She and Tracy stare at each other through the glass.

109.

Hi.
Hi.

TRACY

BROOKE
TRACY
Can I come in?
CUT TO: Tracy sits on some boxes watching Brooke move around
packing.
TRACY
You’re leaving?
BROOKE
In a couple of hours.
try my luck out west.
TRACY
You’re going today?
Thanksgiving?

I’m going to

On

BROOKE
New York isn’t the New York I used
to know. There’s too much
construction. Maybe LA is my lady.
In LA I qualify as well-read.
TRACY
I wanted to say-BROOKE
I know you’re sorry.
TRACY
I’m not really that sorry.
BROOKE
You’re not?
No.

TRACY
BROOKE
Oh then fuck this.
Brooke opens the window again.
TRACY
No, no wait...
(pause)
I looked for you.

110.
BROOKE
I’ve been around.
TRACY
Are you OK? Like, financially?
BROOKE
Yeah. Mamie-Claire gave me
would have been my share of
shirt profits. It was just
to pay off my debts and get
town.

what
our Tenough
out of

TRACY
What will you do in LA?
BROOKE
I don’t know. I think I’m sick.
And I don’t know if my ailment has
a name - it’s just me sitting and
staring at the internet or the
television for long periods of time
interspersed by trying to not do
that and then lying about what I’ve
been doing. Then I’ll get so
excited about something that the
excitement overwhelms me and I
can’t sleep or do anything - and
then I just am in love with
everything but can’t figure out how
to make myself work in the world.
TRACY
I think I have that too.
BROOKE
I wish we lived in feudal times
when your position in the world
couldn’t change. If you were a
king or a peasant you had to just
be happy with who you were.
(pause)
But...wait!
Brooke looks inside an open box.
and hands it to Tracy.
CLOSE: SAT results.

She finds a piece of paper

2200.

TRACY
You can tutor SAT’s now.

111.
BROOKE
Well, I thought I might actually go
to college. I’m not an amputee.
TRACY
(confused)
Right.
BROOKE
I filled out a couple of
applications. I wrote my college
essay all about you.
TRACY
(apprehensive)
Really?
BROOKE
Oh snap! No. It’s about my mom.
But I had you there.
Yeah.

TRACY
Brooke goes into the other room to retrieve more books.
BROOKE (O.S.)
I let Mamie-Claire and Dylan keep
the cats. It’s like, I gave them a
chance for a better life, better
than I could have provided for
them.
TRACY
The cats went from stolen to given
because you changed your mind.
BROOKE (O.S.)
Don’t put that in a story. Not
because I care but because it’s not
a very good observation.
Tracy sees the Mobius Literary Journal (the one with her
story) inside an open box. She’s about to say something, but
thinks better of it. Brooke reenters and tosses books into
the box.
TRACY
You know what’s funny... I’m not
even done with my first semester of
college.

112.
BROOKE
This won’t even be your big
“college story.”
TRACY
I think it’ll always be pretty big.
Brooke hesitates, emotional for a second.
hair like a kid.

She musses Tracy’s

BROOKE
Well, thanks for stopping by, but I
have more packing to do before
Kareem and I break down the front
door.
TRACY
It’ll be hard for me not to look at
New York and think of you somewhere
in it.
Brooke shrugs.
Yeah.

BROOKE
Tracy moves toward the window.

She looks back at her friend.

TRACY
Hey Brooke...
Brooke turns around.
TRACY
It’s not going to be as great as
what my mom and your dad were
planning, but... Do you want to
have Thanksgiving with me?
EXT/INT. VESELKA. DAY
We watch Brooke and Tracy through the window eating pierogis
for Thanksgiving.
TRACY (V.O.)
Meadow had made rich fat women less
fat and rich stupid kids less
stupid and lame rich men less lame.
And she wanted so badly to be on
the other side - to be fat and
stupid and lame and rich.
(MORE)

113.
TRACY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
But what she couldn't see most of
all, more than she couldn't see
that she was never going to get the
restaurant, was that those people
were nothing compared to her. They
were matches to her bonfire. She
was the last cowboy - all romance
and failure. The world was
changing and her kind didn’t have
anywhere to go. Being a beacon of
hope for lesser people is a lonely
business.
And as Brooke and Tracy talk and reminisce and laugh, we CUT
TO BLACK.
