OVER BLACK:
The sound of FEET on EARTH. A WOMAN’S heavy BREATH.
Until we reveal -EXT. ROAD - MORNING
A BLACK WOMAN, ALMA, walks towards us, hauling a BUNDLE
of newly cut CANE. And then -She spots a DOG.
The dog GROWLS at her. This gives her pause, until...
She begins to GROWL right back at it.
And then the dog starts to BARK.
So she starts to BARK too.
There’s some distance between them, but here they are,
barking. It’s loud and strange and just this side of
surreal. Until -The dog gives in. The woman wins.
The dog sits, panting. And then -The dog turns and trots down the road. Surprised, Alma
watches him go, craning her neck until she sees...
A GRAND CARRIAGE
Pulled by TWO HORSES, stopped by the side of the road.
A frail, old CARRIAGE DRIVER sits atop.
The dog stops next to the carriage. Sits.
Alma approaches, cautious, until -A SCREAM
From the carriage.
SUDDENLY -A WHITE WOMAN, PRUDENCE, bursts from the carriage,
running like a banshee. Her FINE CLOTHES are undone,
cascading around her body.
The DOG takes off after her, BARKING.
(CONTINUED)

2.

Alma watches her run, and then -BANG!
Prudence falls to the ground, DEAD.
The dog stops barking. Sniffs the body.
Alma shifts her gaze back towards the carriage, where she
can just make out the TIP of the BARREL of a GUN through
the open door.
And lowering his still smoking pistol, a MAN emerges from
the carriage in the uniform of a UNION SOLDIER.
He tucks his shirt into his unbuttoned pants.
This is HENRY. He’s slick and young and has the eyes of
an animal. It’s unclear if he knows right from wrong, or
if he even cares.
Casually, he buttons his pants.
Now the Carriage Driver sees Alma. A momentary look of
FEAR passes between them. And then Henry notices Alma,
she starts to back away, until -CLICK.
She stops.
A SECOND UNION SOLDIER comes up behind her. A GUN pointed
at her head.
And before she can even scream -BANG!
He shoots her in the head. She falls down, DEAD.
This is MOSES.
He has the kind of good looks that are always getting him
into -- and out of -- trouble. For a man capable of such
cruelty, his eyes are surprisingly warm.
No one would call Moses a bad man, but they wouldn’t call
him a good one, either.
The Carriage Driver closes his eyes and looks away.
Henry smiles and takes an OLD FLASK he’s found in the
carriage. He takes a SIP and winces at the unexpected
taste of brandy.
(CONTINUED)

3.

And then -He pulls a handkerchief out of his pocket, stuffs it into
the neck of the flask, looks up at the Carriage Driver...
And LIGHTS it, throwing it into the carriage. Henry has
his fun UNTIL -The Carriage Driver GRABS the reigns and hits the horse,
who takes off -Moses tries to stop the carriage, stepping IN FRONT of
it, but he is forced to get out of its way -Air whips around the carriage, fanning the FIRE -Moses raises his RIFLE -The Carriage Driver keeps the horse running as the flames
begin to ENGULF the carriage and -BANG!
The Carriage Driver SLUMPS OVER. Dead.
But the horse and carriage continue to run.
Henry walks over to where Moses stands. They watch it as
it goes.
HENRY
I coulda’ used a horse.
Moses looks in the direction of dead Prudence. He makes
sure Henry knows he could have had her first, for
himself.
MOSES
I coulda’ used a woman.
He tosses his now spent cigarette and the soldiers
continue down the road, followed by their dog.
IN THE DISTANCE
The BURNING CARRIAGE is pulled crazily along by the
horse.
And then, our title:

THE KEEPING ROOM

4.

EXT. FARMHOUSE - AFTERNOON
Still. Spare. Yellow. Brown.
The SOUND of HOES hitting dirt as images come in and out:
-- Some old TREES.
-- A FARMHOUSE, small but proud and in the middle of
everything, surrounded by all of its OUT BUILDINGS.
-- A PEN in a field with a single GOAT.
-- The KEEPING ROOM, a cabin-sized stand alone structure,
connected to the house by a WALKWAY.
-- The BARN.
And then, people:
LOUISE and MAD.
Louise is 16 and white. Mad is 30 and black. Both work
the field. Their clothes are worn and dirty.
It’s quiet, save for the noises of their hoes in the
earth.
Until...
A GUNSHOT.
The two women start. Everything stands stock still.
They hear a RUSTLING from the WOODS. They TURN.
Mad raises her HOE.
AND THEN -A WOMAN emerges from the woods. SOMBER and STOIC.
A GOLDEN TEMPEST of hair mussed about her face and
falling down past her shoulders, her dirty dress tied up
around her legs, her boots worn and muddy.
She holds a RIFLE in her hands, but nothing else.
This is AUGUSTA.
Mad lowers her hoe, relieved.
Augusta walks towards the other women, their EYES
hopeful.
(CONTINUED)

5.

But when she walks past them the anger in her eyes tells
them all they need to know: there will be no meat
tonight.
INT. KEEPING ROOM - EVENING
The Keeping Room is self-contained. A little house unto
itself: easy to heat, easy to cool. The small room is
overwhelmed by a large FARM TABLE in the middle. Cabinets
containing JARS and DRIED GOODS stand next to the door.
Windows line the one to the right. A SMALL STOVE is to
the left.
At the end of the table opposite the door is the
FIREPLACE. Pots bubble and spew inside it. The family’s
history hangs above the fire in the form of tintypes,
poppets, dried flowers, an OLD HAT, and several more pots
and pans.
The room is lit up not only by the fire, but also by
small OIL LAMPS that sit in the windows.
The three women barely use the big house now. This room
is their home. If it were big enough, they’d probably
sleep here.
Augusta sits at the head of the table, by the door, and
Louise sits next to her, playing with a SMALL DOLL.
Mad tends to a POT on the fire.
LOUISE
Heard you shoot.
Mad gives Louise a look.
LOUISE (CONT’D)
...what was it?
Augusta doesn’t want to answer.
AUGUSTA
Somethin’ small n’ fast.
Rabbit?
Maybe.

LOUISE
AUGUSTA

Louise thinks about how good that would taste.
They all do.
(CONTINUED)

6.

AUGUSTA (CONT’D)
Don’t even know if it was really there.
She remembers it for a moment.
AUGUSTA (CONT'D)
But once that gun goes off everythin’
livin’ is gone.
LOUISE
Why’s it hard when the only thing there’s
you and the rabbit?
Mad spoons TURNIPS and CARROTS into a LARGE BOWL.
MAD
The woods is big and the rabbit’s small.
She walks over to the table and places it next to a plate
of GROUND HOMINY.
Can I start?

LOUISE

MAD
We all goin’ to.
LOUISE
I was asking my sister.
AUGUSTA
(gently)
No need to talk to Mad like that.
But she’s --

LOUISE

AUGUSTA
(firmer)
Thought you wanted to eat.
Louise is about to say something else, but she gives in
and looks down at her plate.
Mad SITS. And with that, the three women dig in.
They eat with their hands. They’ve given up praying.
Over this -Mad HUMS a haunting tune that takes us to --

7.

EXT. KEEPING ROOM - NIGHT
The three women EMERGE from the door, the lamps from the
windows in hand.
Augusta, RIFLE in her other hand, leads the way as the
women take the walkway to the BACK DOOR of the Farmhouse.
Augusta opens the door and they head in.
INT. FARMHOUSE / BACK HALL - CONTINUOUS
Lit only by the OIL LAMPS, the women cautiously make
their way through the dark house.
The only room they use now is the bedroom; the rest of
the house has become a stranger to them. It’s nearly
empty now, anyway. They’ve sold or traded most everything
that was in it.
As they walk, Mad continues to HUM. It warms their
journey towards sleep.
INT. FARMHOUSE / STAIRCASE - CONTINUOUS
They climb the stairs.
Augusta joins Mad, she knows the SONG well. It gets them
where they need to go.
INT. FARMHOUSE / HALLWAY - NIGHT
From the far end of the hall, the women move towards us.
Still they HUM.
INT. FARMHOUSE / BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
They’ve reached their destination.
They all share this one room.
There is a LARGER BED in the middle of the room, and then
a SMALLER BED has been pulled in that lies perpendicular
on the wall at the foot of the other.
Mad, the last to enter, closes the door. They’ve
fashioned a SLAT OF WOOD that goes across the door and
hooks into two BRACES OF WOOD on either side.
(CONTINUED)

8.

The carpentry is crude, but it works. It gives them a
sense of peace. Of safety.
Mad puts the slat in place. And once she’s done it,
Louise checks to make sure the slat is secure.
Then Louise walks over to Augusta and turns her back to
her. Augusta begins to unbutton Louise’s dress.
Mad walks over to her bed and starts to unbutton her own
dress. Her buttons are in the FRONT.
Once Louise’s buttons are done, Augusta turns her back to
her sister, and Louise unbuttons her.
Mad looks on at the quiet ritual between the sisters.
Then she steps out of her own dress and gets into bed.
Once Louise has unbuttoned Augusta’s last button, Louise
gets into bed. Augusta places her RIFLE by the side of
the bed she shares with Louise. She puts out her lamp and
crawls in next to her sister.
I’m cold.

LOUISE

Augusta wraps her arms around her, keeping her close.
Mad blows out her lamp and looks on in the moonlight from
her bed as the two sisters fall asleep.
EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
An empty road.
The SOUND of a HORSE, moving fast.
Then, HORSE and RIDER are seen in the distance. They
approach at a steady pace.
Perhaps we get glimpses:
-- The rider’s BOOTS
-- Dark leather GLOVED HANDS holding REINS
-- The uniform of the UNION ARMY
He rides fast and true; he knows where he’s going.
RIDER and HORSE fill the frame as the pounding of HOOFS
becomes overwhelming...

9.

EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAWN
A fat, orange SUN creeps over the house and fields.
Insects BUZZ about in shafts of early morning light.
EXT. GOAT FIELD - SAME
HATTY, the lone GOAT, chews some grass.
EXT. WOODS - SAME
Augusta searches for prey as the sun finishes rising.
She hears a NOISE. Stops. Looks...
NOTHING.
She continues on.
INT. FARMHOUSE / BEDROOM - SAME
Louise lies asleep. The only one left in the room.
She stirs, WAKES. Looks over at the OPEN WINDOW as the
CURTAIN rolls over the breeze.
EXT. FIELD - SAME
Mad harvests some TURNIPS. The yield is unimpressive.
EXT. WOODS - LATER
Augusta stops by a CREEK.
She crouches down. Splashes some water on her face. Cups
some in her hand, drinks it.
Takes in the moment of rest. And then she’s off again.
EXT. ANOTHER FIELD - LATER
Louise has wandered out to the grass, still in her
nightgown, feet bare.

10.

EXT. LARGE TREE - LATER
A HEADSTONE juts out from a moss covered mound of dirt.
Louise kneels down and drops the wildflowers in front of
the cross. She sits, cross-legged, elbow on knee, face in
hand, just looking at the dirt.
EXT. WOODS - LATER
Augusta stands completely still, gun up. She closes her
eyes, hoping she’ll see where the animals are in her
mind. But she can’t.
No matter how hard she tries, she can’t make the animals
come back.
She opens her eyes and then -A GLIMPSE of movement not too far off.
EXT. FARMHOUSE - LATER
WIDE on the farmhouse and BARN. The land is STILL.
EXT. BARN - SAME
Mad BRUSHES the old horse, FERN, who is tied to a FENCE
POST. She pets her nose and then wipes sweat from her own
brow.
Not too far off, Louise dreams on a MAKE-SHIFT SWING that
hangs lazily from an OLD OAK.
Mad cranes her neck and calls out -MAD
What you doin’ over there?
Nothin.’

LOUISE

MAD
You should come n’ help me brush this
girl.
I’m tired --

LOUISE

(CONTINUED)

11.

MAD
Funny thing considerin’ you ain’t done uh
stitch uh work all day.
And SUDDENLY -BANG!
A GUNSHOT rings out in the distance.
It catches Louise off guard -She GRABS tight to the rope. Steadies herself.
A CRY OF JOY
Rips out from beyond the trees.
Mad runs over to where she can see the trees. Louise
jumps from the swing and joins her. They look towards the
woods, breathless, searching -AND THEN -Augusta EXPLODES through the crest of trees, her face
bursting into a GRIN.
Mad runs to her, Louise following behind -Augusta HOLLERS and WHOOPS -They reach each other and Augusta holds up
A DEAD RABBIT.
Mad and Louise join in the CHORUS and together they run
straight to the Keeping Room.
INT. KEEPING ROOM - DUSK
Mad’s beautiful, dark HAND as she DIGS a KNIFE into the
FLESH of the rabbit. She is deliberate: she knows how
this is done.
There is an inherent violence to the act itself, pulling
the skin off an animal.
And then:
-- The SKIN is cut away.
-- Mad wipes sweat from her face and eyes, leaving a
SMEAR of BLOOD behind.
(CONTINUED)

12.

-- Augusta WATCHES.
-- Louise WATCHES too.
-- The SKINNED RABBIT hits the BUTCHER’S BLOCK.
-- Augusta hands Mad a CLEAVER.
-- Mad LOWERS the cleaver into the animal, and she HACKS
the rabbit to pieces.
-- Mad drops the PIECES onto a SKILLET.
The women wait. The rabbit boils.
They are hungry.
INT. KEEPING ROOM - NIGHT
A PEWTER TRAY
With pieces of BOILED RABBIT smack in the middle.
The women take a moment and stare at the beauty of the
creature. It’s proud body in pieces, warm and brown.
Augusta leans in and SMELLS it.
Then Mad.
Then Louise.
This smell will line their hearts for months.
Louise goes to grab a piece, but Augusta stops her.
Louise looks up at her and -Augusta’s eyes are CLOSED.
Louise and Mad exchange a look. Then Mad closes her eyes.
And then Louise does, too.
After a moment -Alright.

AUGUSTA

A smile creeps over Louise’s face. She looks at her
sister, real proud.
A shy smile comes over Mad. She looks at Augusta out of
the corner of her eye, and Augusta smiles back.
(CONTINUED)

13.

And then -THEY EAT.
They devour the rabbit like ANIMALS, tearing at it’s
muscles, it’s meat, using their hands and mouths, but
they experience the emotions of the moment like WOMEN,
pulling in the textures and flavors and smells to their
hearts and minds. Inexplicably ravaging and savoring at
the same time.
And they can sense each other doing and feeling
everything together.
It’s almost holy.
INT. KEEPING ROOM - LATER
Mad holds an OLD BANJO and SINGS. Louise and Augusta sing
along. Augusta BANGS on the table to the rhythm.
Louise DANCES.
Augusta gets up and joins her sister. Arms linked, they
move about the room as one.
The song ends and Louise claps.
Augusta falls into her chair.
And then Mad starts to play another SONG, but this one is
different. It is very quiet, and very sad.
LOUISE
But we don’t know this -AUGUSTA
(gently)
Shhhh -LOUISE
I want her to play -AUGUSTA
(still gentle)
Mad’s singin’ what she wants to.
Louise slowly concedes, sitting and listening, arms
crossed.
It’s a work song. It’s about loss and suffering. But also
it’s love song. A song about hope. And Mad knows it well.
(CONTINUED)

14.

The song ends. It’s followed by a long silence that
somehow feels like it’s part of the song.
And over this -The sound of RAIN lightly tapping on the windows of the
Keeping Room. The WIND gently rattling the old glass.
The rain gets louder and louder, UNTIL -CUT TO:
INT. FARMHOUSE / BEDROOM - NIGHT
Louise WAKES in a sweat. She GASPS. Wakes Augusta.
They WHISPER, so as not to wake Mad.
What is it?
I saw ‘em.
Saw who?

AUGUSTA
LOUISE
AUGUSTA

Augusta touches her face, trying to calm her.
LOUISE
Daddy and Nathaniel.
Beat.
AUGUSTA
Was only a dream -LOUISE
But I was there -AUGUSTA
(gently)
Go back to sleep.
Augusta lies back down. Louise does too.
There’s a moment of silence.
LOUISE
Can’t stop hopin’ they might come back --

(CONTINUED)

15.

AUGUSTA
Our father and brother ain’t desertin’ no
duty.
LOUISE
It was like it was really happenin’, they
needed me -AUGUSTA
What happens when you sleep ain’t real.
Louise gives in. Augusta closes her eyes and puts her arm
around her sister.
Rain TAPS the windows. Wind RATTLES the glass.
EXT. FARMHOUSE - MORNING
WATER from the night’s rain hangs on the GREEN LEAVES of
trees. The sun casts SHADOWS of their trunks and branches
on the side of the house.
INT. FARMHOUSE / BEDROOM - SAME
Augusta wakes to see Louise is no longer in bed.
In her own bed, Mad sleeps.
INT. FARMHOUSE / HALLWAY - SAME
Augusta slips along the upstairs hallways of the house.
The old wood PALE and PURPLE in the morning light.
A door is slightly ajar at the end of the hall. Augusta
moves towards it.
THROUGH THE CRACK IN THE DOOR
We see the BACK of a WOMAN inside the room looking at
herself in a mirror. The woman wears a fine LAVENDER
DRESS. Her hair is so long and so dark. We can’t see her
face.
Augusta pushes forward, the door CREAKS -The woman TURNS -And as she turns she becomes...
LOUISE.
(CONTINUED)

16.

Augusta shakes her head back into the moment.
AUGUSTA
Thought you was a ghost.
LOUISE
I look like her.
It’s not easy for Augusta.
You do.

AUGUSTA

She tries to push through it -LOUISE
Almost fits me now.
But she can’t.
AUGUSTA
You should take it off -LOUISE
But I just put it on -AUGUSTA
I best not see that dress movin’ again.
Augusta leaves. Louise turns and looks at herself over
her shoulder, to see the back.
EXT. FIELDS - LATER
Mad and Augusta work the land.
Louise approaches, carrying a bucket of water, still
wearing their MOTHER’S DRESS.
Louise puts down the bucket.
Mad looks at Louise and then at Augusta.
AUGUSTA
Thought I told you to take that off.
Mad hands Louise a hoe.
LOUISE
Didn’t feel like it.
Louise goes to work.
(CONTINUED)

17.

AUGUSTA
Louise, I’m asking you, please.
Mad reaches into the bucket, drinks a ladle-full of water
and then dips it back in and hands the ladle to Augusta.
LOUISE
Why you care so much?
Augusta drinks, throws the ladle back into the bucket.
AUGUSTA
You gonna ruin it.
Mad and Augusta go back to work.
After a moment, Louise deliberately drops her hoe.
LOUISE
Don’t feel like hoein’.
Mad gives Louise a LOOK. Louise meets her gaze.
LOUISE (CONT’D)
Don’t like her lookin’ at me that way.
AUGUSTA
Get back to work.
LOUISE
She’s the nigger, she should do it.
Mad just shakes her head and keeps on working.
AUGUSTA
Like I told you, Louise: we all niggers
now.
Augusta resumes her work with Mad.
Louise hesitates, then makes a decision and walks away.
Mad looks up at Augusta. Augusta doesn’t return the gaze.
INT. KEEPING ROOM - NIGHT
The three women sit in SILENCE around the table.
Louise still wears the dress. She pushes TURNIPS around
the edges of her plate.
Mad and Augusta have just about finished their dinner.
(CONTINUED)

18.

Augusta looks at her sister, and then at Mad. Mad and
Augusta share a look, and Augusta makes eyes at her.
Mad doesn’t know what the eyes mean.
Augusta gets up, goes over to the cupboard and pulls out
a LONG, THIN SCRAP of fabric.
Now Mad knows...
Augusta comes up behind Louise and wraps the fabric
around her eyes, BLINDFOLDING her.
LOUISE
No! I don’t want to -Louise goes to pull it off but before she can, Augusta
slips an ONION into her hands. She just holds it there
for a moment until...
She moves the onion from one hand to the other, and then
smells it.
Mad and Augusta look on intently.
LOUISE (CONT’D)
It’s an onion.
Augusta and Mad CLAP and HOLLER. Louise pulls off the
blindfold and puts down the onion.
Augusta grabs the blindfold and ties it around Mad’s
face. She looks around the room for something. She
gestures quietly for Louise to join her. Louise can’t
help but SMILE.
They dart around the room, rejecting each other’s choices
in silence so as not to give themselves away.
And then Augusta has an IDEA and she pulls off her
BLOOMERS. Louise STIFLES a GIANT LAUGH and hands the
bloomers to Mad. Mad inspects them, moves them through
her hands.
Suddenly realizing what they are, she drops them.
MAD
(removing the blindfold)
Good lord I know you know better.
Mad shakes her head.
Louise and Augusta LAUGH. Mad concedes, LAUGHING too.
(CONTINUED)

19.

Augusta puts her bloomers back on.
LOUISE
It’s your turn Augusta.
Louise grabs the blindfold and wraps it around Augusta’s
face. Mad and Louise move around the room and before Mad
can say anything, Louise pulls the MAN’S HAT down from
above the fire and hands it to Augusta.
Augusta holds it in her hands. She feels it, slowly. She
suddenly stops smiling and gets real QUIET.
She takes off the blindfold and puts the hat back above
the fire.
LOUISE (CONT’D)
What? What’s wrong?
AUGUSTA
I’m done playin’.
EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
Even in the darkness the sky and land are so very big.
Our Rider sits on the ground next to a small fire, his
HORSE nearby.
It’s quiet. He warms his hands.
And then we see his face. It’s warm and tired and dark.
BLACK RIDER
Cold tonight.
He waits.
BLACK RIDER (CONT’D)
You don’t talk much, do ya?
He looks at his HORSE. Waits for a response.
Shit.

BLACK RIDER (CONT’D)

He pulls a BATTERED FLASK out from his coat. He takes a
sip and WINCES. And then another. He clears his throat.

(CONTINUED)

20.

BLACK RIDER (CONT’D)
I miss the sound of a woman’s voice.
‘Specially the tough ones, cause they
still smooth in they way. The sound of it
when they wake up wantin’ some.
He remembers. He takes another swig.
Want a drop?

BLACK RIDER (CONT’D)

Suddenly Bill’s face CHANGES -He senses something we cannot.
And then, the sound of HORSES GALLOPING.
Quickly, he stamps out the fire and pulls his horse to
the ground. The horse bristles and bays under the
surprise of the motion, but as the Black Rider lays down
on the horse’s neck, it finally submits, lying quietly on
the ground under his master.
SILHOUETTES of MEN ON HORSES pass like thunder.
The Black Rider’s face and the face of his horse are so
very close together, lying there on the cold ground,
disappeared in the darkness.
EXT. KEEPING ROOM - THE NEXT MORNING
CRACK!
An AXE and LOG descend into frame.
The axe is held by Augusta.
A piece of wood SPLINTERS in two.
Augusta resets with a new piece of wood and her axe. This
is ritualistic for her. She knocks the axe gently into
the piece of wood, the axe catching in it. Then she
raises her arms, wood and axe as one, and...
CRACK!
Augusta takes another log. Notches the Axe. Reels back.
And...
CRACK!
But there’s a SOUND behind the sound.
(CONTINUED)

21.

SHE STOPS. Listens. Did she hear it?
Nothing.
She resets -Raises the axe and log over her head, and -A SCREAM
Not too far off.
She drops the axe and wood, grabs her RIFLE, and runs.
EXT. WOODS - SAME
Mad is running just up ahead of her. Augusta runs past.
They come upon Louise, on the ground, WAILING. A fresh
RED WOUND shines on her leg.
AUGUSTA
What happened?
She looks around, trying to discover the danger.
Louise won’t focus. Augusta bends down.
AUGUSTA (CONT’D)
(grabbing her)
Louise! What happened?
LOUISE
(just barely)
...raccoon.
Augusta looks around once more, but there’s nothing.
She looks at Mad.
AUGUSTA
(to Mad)
She was supposed to be workin’ with you -MAD
Can’t keep my eyes on her all the time.
There’ work to do and she’s gotta learn
what’s right -Augusta stands and SLAPS Mad.
Mad shows no sign of pain.
(CONTINUED)

22.

THEN -Mad SLAPS Augusta.
Augusta holds her face. A long moment. She’s about to say
something, to apologize, but then -AUGUSTA
We best get her inside.
The women struggle to lift Louise.
INT. FARMHOUSE / BEDROOM - MORNING
Louise SWEATS and MOANS in the bed. Her eyes are half
open, searching. Augusta sits by her side, mopping her
brow. Mad stands at the foot of the bed.
Augusta lifts up the sheet to look at the bite.
It’s worse now. Swollen and angry.
AUGUSTA
We need some medicin’.
MAD
Maybe they got somethin’ at the Weaver
place.
Louise MOANS. Mad comes around and sits on the other side
of her. She takes the cloth from Augusta and gently wipes
Louise’s face.
MAD (CONT’D)
(to Augusta)
You should go.
Over this -The sound of HORSE HOOVES pounding earth, gradually
getting louder, taking us to -EXT. ROAD - MORNING
Fern goes as fast as her old body can.
Augusta rides, following the old dirt road past countless
trees and hills -- so many shades of green and brown -that roll out BIG and QUIET around her.

23.

EXT. ROAD - LATER
The SUN is beginning to move past the center of the sky,
casting shadows, playing tricks on the world around her.
She’d almost forgotten how big some hills, how big some
trees can be. She’d almost forgotten about the world
outside her world, about the shadows and the secrets that
lie beyond the boundaries of her land.
How even during the day, the BLUE and PURPLE MIST can
fill the sky and cover the mountains with such longing
and mystery.
EXT. ROAD - LATER
As Augusta makes her way down the road, she approaches a
SMALL, ONE-STORY HOUSE set back against a clump of tall
trees.
This is the WEAVER HOUSE.
EXT. WEAVER HOUSE - SAME
Augusta dismounts Fern and drops the reigns; the old
horse isn’t going anywhere.
She approaches the HOUSE.
EXT. WEAVER HOUSE - SAME
Augusta moves to the door and knocks. It creaks open
under the weight of her fist.
Hello?

AUGUSTA

Beat.
Mary?

AUGUSTA (CONT’D)

Beat.
Clara?
Augusta goes inside.

AUGUSTA (CONT’D)

24.

INT. WEAVER HOUSE / FRONT HALL - SAME
Augusta moves through the front hall of the house.
It doesn’t look lived in. Just the opposite: this place
has been abandoned. No noise. Just dark and quiet.
Mary? Clara?

AUGUSTA

She goes into one of the bedrooms.
INT. WEAVER HOUSE / BEDROOM - SAME
She rummages through the cabinets, looking for something,
anything to help Louise. Problem is, she doesn’t know
what she’s looking for.
All she finds are a tintype of a baby, some sewing tools
and some unidentifiable dried HERB.
She smells the herb and sticks it in the belt of her
skirt, just in case.
She looks up and she catches a glimpse of something in a
mirror -It’s just her own reflection. She steadies herself.
The SOUND OF FLIES slowly fades up...
INT. WEAVER HOUSE / FRONT HALL - SAME
Augusta goes back through the hallway. Now she notices
the FLIES on the WALLS and flying in the air around her.
INT. WEAVER HOUSE / ANOTHER BEDROOM - SAME
Augusta pushes open the door.
In front of her is a WOMAN sitting motionless in a CHAIR.
She leans to one side, her arm hanging down.
FLIES are EVERYWHERE.
Augusta goes to her.
...Mary?

AUGUSTA

MARY is motionless. Her eyes WIDE OPEN.
(CONTINUED)

25.

The WOMAN is DEAD.
The DIN from the FLIES is UNBEARABLE.
Augusta SWATS them away, kneels in front of her.
Mary.

AUGUSTA (CONT’D)

Augusta follows her lifeless arm down to the floor where
a bottle lies, broken. Some kind of POISON.
Augusta picks up the bottle and places it on the table
next to the bed. She sits Mary straight up, not sure what
else to do.
AND THEN -Closes her eyelids. Puts Mary’s hands in her lap.
She steps back and looks at her work.
EXT. WEAVER HOUSE - AFTERNOON
Augusta walks quickly out of the house and away from it.
Once outside, she stops and stands for a moment, trying
to catch her breath.
Is the whole world this way now?
EXT. ROAD - LATER
Augusta rides. The wilderness begins to subside.
Fern is tired. Augusta, too.
EXT. CALEB’S - LATE AFTERNOON
For all the farms and houses in the outlying areas,
Caleb’s serves as the closest thing to a town. The needs
of most are met with Caleb’s whores and Caleb’s liquor.
While it’s a stand alone building, there are usually
people and horses filling the road in front.
But now it’s virtually deserted. Augusta had no idea.
She approaches the building and sees a dog, THE DOG,
sitting out front.
(CONTINUED)

26.

She dismounts and drops Fern’s reigns as before.
Augusta stands still and regards the dog. It’s a comfort
after what she’s just seen.
Augusta moves to pet him. She gets closer...
GRRRRRRRRRRR.
The dog GROWLS.
And as she gets closer he just gets louder so she backs
up -- CAUTIOUS -- and makes her way inside.
INT. CALEB’S - SAME
At the far end of the room is the BAR. And on the left
side of the room is a STAIRCASE leading up to a small
LANDING.
TWO OLD MEN too old and crippled to fight look up from
their game of CARDS as Augusta moves towards the bar. ONE
COUGHS the wheezing cough of someone close to death.
She makes it to the BAR.
CALEB, the old bartender, turns. He’s too old to fight
but not too old to know what’s what. His face is grizzled
and bearded and kind.
...Augusta?
Caleb.

CALEB
AUGUSTA

CALEB
You shouldn’t be here.
I know.

AUGUSTA

Beat.
AUGUSTA (CONT’D)
Anyone come back since last time?
CALEB
A few injureds. A few deserters. Can’t
say who.
AUGUSTA
But no sign of my -(CONTINUED)

27.

No.

CALEB

Augusta tries to hide how foolish she feels for thinking
maybe there would be good news.
AUGUSTA
You hear from anyone out at the Weaver
place? Seen Clara?
CALEB
Mary was the last one I saw. Few months
back. She was lookin’ for Clara. She run
off. Musta gone West, I said.
AUGUSTA
I just been there.
And?
Mary’s dead.
No...

CALEB
AUGUSTA

CALEB

AUGUSTA
Drank herself some poison.

CALEB
You come here just to tell me that?
AUGUSTA
No. Louise. Raccoon bit ‘er.
CALEB
You been ridin’ all day?
Almost -On Fern?
Yessir.

AUGUSTA
CALEB
AUGUSTA

CALEB
That old horse dead yet?
Just about.

AUGUSTA

Caleb motions with his eyes to the room behind her.

(CONTINUED)

28.

CALEB
You should go.
Augusta turns to see -TWO SOLDIERS at a table by the fire. Wearing uniforms of
the UNION ARMY.
We know them as MOSES and HENRY.
They drink from a JUG of MOONSHINE. Moses smokes one of
his hand rolled CIGARETTES.
As Augusta turns back, there beside her is
A WHORE.
Her bright colors have faded, rouge misplaced on a
forgotten face.
It’s hard to tell if she’s young or old, but if there
wasn’t a war on, you can be sure she’d be beautiful.
This is MOLL.
Here.

MOLL

She extends a SMALL GLASS OF MOONSHINE to Augusta.
AUGUSTA
What’s this for?
MOLL
You’ll know soon enough.
Augusta swallows it whole. Sputters.
Good girl.

MOLL (CONT’D)

Beat.
AUGUSTA
Went to the Weaver’s hopin’ for some
medcin’. Found this -Augusta pulls the dried HERB from her belt. Moll takes
it. Smells it.
MOLL
Dried sage won’t help nothin’ but stew.

(CONTINUED)

29.

AUGUSTA
Came here hopin’ for better luck.
CALEB
Ain’t been medcin’ here in a long time.
You should go ‘fore they sober up -AUGUSTA
I can’t go back with nothin’.
Wait here.

MOLL

Moll goes.
Caleb and Augusta watch her.
The soldiers do too.
It’s quiet and tense and then -Moll returns. She has a SMALL LEATHER POUCH in her hand,
which she puts on the bar.
MOLL (CONT’D)
You put her in the tub. You boil water
beyond boilin’. Don’t worry bout burnin’
her. Got that?
Yes ma’am.

AUGUSTA

MOLL
And close her up in that hot room. No
matter how much she fights, you keep her
there. It’s once she stops fightin’ you
take her out.
Alright.

AUGUSTA

MOLL
You got vinegar?
Augusta nods.
MOLL (CONT’D)
After the heat, you put vinegar on that
wound as much as she’ll let you. And then
take some of this -Moll nods to the POUCH --

(CONTINUED)

30.

MOLL (CONT’D)
Slather it on the wound n’ leave it.
AUGUSTA
Thought you said there wasn’t no -CALEB
I wouldn’t call that medcin’.
AUGUSTA
But it’ll work?
Moll considers.
MOLL
You ready for her to die?
Augusta shakes her head. No.
Moll pours them each a SHOT.
MOLL (CONT’D)
It might work. But you get ready.
They down the shots.
Augusta winces.
Alright.

AUGUSTA

Moll leans in. Whispers.
MOLL
Where you ridin’ to?
AUGUSTA
Due east. Night’s ride.
MOLL
What you ridin’?
AUGUSTA
A dead horse.
Moll looks at Augusta real good and then moves away, just
barely motioning for Caleb to follow her. He does.
Augusta watches as they walk to the side of the bar. She
fiddles with her empty glass.
She can’t help herself. She turns to the SOLDIERS...
And they are staring RIGHT AT HER. Henry SMILES.
(CONTINUED)

31.

Augusta starts to look away, past Henry’s face, but
something about Moses’ eyes stops her turning.
It’s an instant, so small, but their eyes lock and then -quickly -- she turns away.
Moll and Caleb return. Caleb does not look happy.
Moll leans in and WHISPERS -MOLL
You’re gettin’ Captain. He’s a good
horse.
AUGUSTA
Why you bein’ so nice to me?
MOLL
I knew your Daddy. He was a good man.
AUGUSTA
He was alright.
A look passes between them and then -Moll pours them one LAST SHOT.
CALEB
Hey, how much uh that you gonna -MOLL
We’re only savin’ it for someone who
needs it.
They shoot the drinks.
HENRY (O.C.)
(drunk)
I see you found more liquor.
And suddenly he’s right behind them.
CALEB
(scared, now)
Sure thing. Here you go.
He hands him the JUG.
HENRY
(not taking his eyes off
Augusta)
What’d ya know, Moses. This place is
luckier than we thought.
(CONTINUED)

32.

It’s tense.
HENRY (CONT’D)
(to Augusta)
Didn’t think they came this pretty
anymore. You comin’ over?
Augusta keeps her eyes DOWN and does not respond.
HENRY (CONT’D)
...maybe later.
He walks back to his table.
CALEB
(clearly lying)
Got even more in the back for you, just
wait there...
Caleb goes.
Moll waits a moment and then, quiet as can be:
MOLL
Go upstairs through the room and out the
window. Caleb’ll be waitin’.
AUGUSTA
(barely audible)
Thank you.
Augusta and Moll share a look and then, just like that:
Moll turns, all SMILES and ARMS as she heads towards the
table with the Soldiers.
MOLL
You boys hungry for me?
She playfully sits on Henry’s lap.
Augusta stands, doing her best to be INVISIBLE.
But Moses follows her with his EYES, a dog following
meat. Henry, meanwhile, is consumed with Moll.
Augusta walks past them as calmly as she can.
Sensing Moses, Moll puts her hand on his PANTS...
MOLL (CONT’D)
I bet you want some too...
Moses REMOVES her hand, eyes on Augusta.
(CONTINUED)

33.

ON THE STAIRS
Augusta slowly moves to the top. LAUGHTER behind her.
She reaches the top and heads down the LANDING towards a
DOOR. She pushes it OPEN -She looks back to see Moses watching her. With a GLANCE,
she does her best to pretend like she knew he was
watching -And then she DISAPPEARS into the ROOM.
BACK AT THE TABLE
Moses watches Augusta enter the room, and -He STANDS. Moves to the
STAIRS
And quickly ascends, as if invited by her eyes.
MOLL (CONT’D)
(too loudly)
Where you goin’ honey?
Moses is now on the LANDING and walking towards the DOOR MOLL (O.C.) (CONT’D)
Ain’t nothin’ up there but -HENRY (O.C.)
(severe)
Better things to do with your mouth than
talk.
Moses OPENS the door...
INT. CALEB’S / UPSTAIRS ROOM - SAME
OLD WALLPAPER peels, its flowers rotting on the walls.
A small double BED sits on the far side of the room.
But she’s NOT THERE.
And then he sees it -AN OPEN WINDOW.
Moses moves quickly to the WINDOW and --

34.

INT. CALEB’S - SAME
Henry is roughly moving his mouth all over Moll -And outside the dog starts BARKING.
Henry hears it and stops. But Moll grabs his face,
forcing her lips onto his -Henry pulls away, but Moll grabs him back. And he tries
to PULL AWAY again but when he does she BITES DOWN.
He rips his BLOODIED LIP from her. There’s BLOOD all over
HER MOUTH, too -The dog BARKS louder -He reels back and SMACKS her. She FALLS.
He hustles out the front door -EXT. CALEB’S - LATE AFTERNOON
The dog stands BARKING at the feet of a FINE HORSE.
Moses -- having just jumped down from the window -stands up, sees something, and slowly puts his HANDS in
the air.
And then from BEHIND HIM we see -Augusta siting atop the fine horse -- CAPTAIN -- her
RIFLE pointed right at Moses.
The dog between them BARKS and BARKS.
Caleb stands, BREATHLESS, between the girl on the horse
and the soldier.
Henry comes running and stops when he sees what’s
happening. He reaches for his gun, but before he can grab
it Augusta turns her rifle towards him. Captain readjusts
his feet.
Henry freezes.
And then everyone is stock still and silent save for the
dog, who continues to BARK -MOSES
Quiet now, boy.
He keeps going.
(CONTINUED)

35.

MOSES (CONT’D)
(harsh)
I said quiet! Come here.
He whistles. The dog obeys.
And now Moll comes running out.
MOSES (CONT’D)
(to Augusta)
Don’t think he likes what you’re up to.
The alcohol is hitting Augusta, making her bold and a
little less afraid.
AUGUSTA
From what I seen that dog don’t like much
‘uh anything.
Battle.
What?

MOSES
AUGUSTA

MOSES
His name. Battle.
Beat.
AUGUSTA
Sure sounds like one.
Moses smiles.
MOSES
That’s a mighty fine horse for a girl.
CALEB
(to Augusta)
You go on now.
MOSES
She got somewhere to be?
I do.

AUGUSTA

MOSES
All on your own?
Moses moves a little closer to her.

(CONTINUED)

36.

MOLL
No, she’s got people.
Augusta looks at Moll and then back at Moses.
Lots of ‘em.

AUGUSTA

Augusta surveys from her mount:
-- Caleb looks up at her, fear in his eyes.
-- Poor old Fern, tied up, barely standing.
-- The soldiers.
-- Moll, lips still covered in Henry’s blood.
GO.

MOLL

SUDDENLY -Augusta slings the rifle around her back, turns the
horse, and RACES AWAY.
EXT. CALEB’S - SAME
Augusta rides Captain away from the others.
EXT. CALEB’S - SAME
Moses and Henry turn towards Moll and Caleb who stand by,
uneasily awaiting their fate.
EXT. ROAD NEAR CALEB’S - SAME
Augusta rides on.
In the distance, a GUNSHOT.
And then ANOTHER.
Augusta keeps going.
ANOTHER.
She kicks Captain to RUN FASTER, leaving the others
behind.
It’s just the NIGHT and the GIRL and the HORSE.

37.

EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
Augusta and Captain ride on through the darkest night.
The road is lined with PRICKLY BUSHES that grab at her.
Something catches on them, holding Augusta for a moment -frightening her -- but Captain is strong and he pulls
away.
EXT. WOODS - LATER
Augusta is exhausted...
But Captain’s just getting started.
EXT. FARMHOUSE - LATER
The sound of HOOVES get closer and closer.
Mad cautiously moves closer to the road.
And then she sees...
IT IS AUGUSTA
Slumped over Captain’s back.
Mad runs to her.
Augusta literally falls off the horse and into Mad’s
arms. She looks at Mad’s beautiful, familiar face.
An exhausted smile consumes her and she throws her arms
around Mad. Mad holds her up, taken aback by this show of
affection.
Mad takes Augusta’s arm and slings it across her
shoulders, slipping her arm around Augusta’s waist to
help her walk.
They move like this towards the house, Augusta holding
Captain’s lead, Mad holding Augusta.
MAD
Where you get that horse?
AUGUSTA
Whore gave it to me.
MAD
I knew your Daddy wasn’t just playin’
cards.
(CONTINUED)

38.

And with that Augusta stops and...
VOMITS at Mad’s feet.
INT. KEEPING ROOM - THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
Mad and Augusta take a GIANT POT OF WATER off the fire.
They struggle as they carry it out of the Keeping Room
and head to -EXT. KEEPING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
The water SLOSHES between them as they move across the
walkway and into -INT. FARMHOUSE / STAIRS - CONTINUOUS
They head up the stairs to the -INT. FARMHOUSE / HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
Mad kicks a door open. STEAM pours out and we see -Louise sitting in an old wooden TUB, knees tucked up to
her chest, arms wrapped around her knees.
Shivering. Shaking.
Mad and Augusta DROP the pot.
Augusta SLAMS the door closed.
Augusta comes over and begins to LADLE the hot water onto
Louise’s back.
Small GASPS and MOANS come from Louise, as if without her
knowledge or permission.
Augusta ladles more onto Louise and into the tub.
Louise won’t stop SHAKING.
Mad crouches down at the base of the tub. She puts her
hands on it, holding tight. Augusta drops the ladle and
crouches too.
Louise’s skin is HOT and RED. Augusta reaches her hand
out to her, smooths her hair.
And the three women sit there.
(CONTINUED)

39.

All they can do is wait.
INT. FARMHOUSE / BEDROOM - LATER
Louise lies in bed, red-faced and breathing deeply.
Mad has fallen asleep next to her, exhausted.
Augusta looks on at the two sleeping women from the foot
of the bed. She leans in and lifts the skirt of Louise’s
nightgown. The WOUND shines PURPLE and BLACK. She takes a
cloth, dabs it with VINEGAR and applies it to the wound.
Louise WAKES and CRIES OUT, cringing at the pain.
Augusta puts her hand out to Louise, who grabs it TIGHT.
Augusta does her best to hide how relieved and surprised
she is that Louise is awake.
Then she takes the MUSLIN POUCH from her pocket. She
smells it: it’s AWFUL. She turns her nose away.
She dips her hand in and -Louise stops Augusta’s hand with her other hand. With her
eyes, Augusta tells her that this one won’t hurt.
Louise lets go of the hand with the poultice.
Augusta SLATHERS the GREEN POULTICE over Louise’s wound.
Louise strains to lift herself to look.
Don’t --

AUGUSTA

LOUISE
I wanna see it.
Augusta holds her up so she can see.
LOUISE (CONT’D)
Looks disgustin’.
AUGUSTA
Smells even worse.
She helps Louise back down to the pillow.
AUGUSTA (CONT’D)
You should try ‘n sleep.
(CONTINUED)

40.

LOUISE
Don’t want to.
Augusta can feel her sister’s fear. Even more reason to
hide her own.
AUGUSTA
I can just keep talkin’ til you do...
Louise nods.
AUGUSTA (CONT’D)
I remember daddy tellin’ a story bout a
girl ‘n her sister?
Augusta picks up some MUSLIN SCRAPS she’s made to bandage
Louise’s leg. And as she tells the story, she carefully
wraps and bandages the wound.
AUGUSTA (CONT’D)
And the girl was gonna be killed by the
king.
What king?

LOUISE

AUGUSTA
I don’t know, some king somewhere.
LOUISE
Why was he gonna kill her?
AUGUSTA
Guess she musta done somethin’ he didn’t
like. The whole town turns up for the
execution, includin’ the girl’s sister.
And the sister goes to the girl, who’s
crying now, and says, when the king asks
you for any last words, say you want me
to tell you a story.
Louise listens intently, now.
AUGUSTA (CONT’D)
So when the king asks, the girl says -- I
want my sister to tell me a story. The
king grants the request and the sister
starts tellin’ a story so good that the
king can’t help but listen. And dawn has
come and gone and now it’s twilight. And
the whole town is still standin’ there
with their hearts in their throats. And
suddenly, at just the most excitin’ part,
she stops -(CONTINUED)

41.

Why?

LOUISE

AUGUSTA
She says to the king -- you want to know
the rest, I will tell you tomorrow if you
give my sister one more day. Now the
townspeople think he’ll kill ‘em both,
but the King, needin’ to know the end,
says yes.
LOUISE
What was the story she was tellin’?
AUGUSTA
I only remember the part ‘bout her
tellin’ it.
LOUISE
So did the king kill the girl after?
AUGUSTA
The next day, just as soon as the sister
finished that story she started another
and she stopped that one just ‘fore the
best part and the same thing happened the
next night and the next night for near a
thousand nights.
Louise’s eyes are starting to close...
LOUISE
What happened to the girl?
AUGUSTA
As long as her sister kept tellin’
stories, she didn’t have to die.
They drift OPEN one last time...
AUGUSTA (CONT’D)
And after she told all those stories, I
think the king married her.
She’s asleep.
Augusta watches her.
And then, after a moment, come the heavy breaths, the
breaths that try to keep in the tears. The tears she’s
been holding back since the moment she thought her sister
might die. Since the bite. Since the body. Since the
town. Since the men.
(CONTINUED)

42.

And then -Big, hard tears. Short, deep breaths. She makes it as
quiet as she can, but she can’t keep it in. Not anymore.
And after one last deep exhale, she feels something -She LOOKS UP.
Mad, still lying down, is awake and looking right at her.
Augusta looks right back. No words pass between them.
They don’t have to.
INT. KEEPING ROOM - AFTERNOON
Mad takes inventory on the shelves, organizing what’s
left. Augusta comes in, still in her dress from the day
before.
She looks like she’s just woken up.
AUGUSTA
Day’s half over.
MAD
Didn’t wanna wake you.
Augusta moves and sits at the table.
MAD (CONT’D)
...She up too?
Augusta shakes her head. No.
MAD (CONT’D)
She needs the rest. Comin’ back to life
ain’t easy.
Augusta looks out the window at the already waning sun.
AUGUSTA
Too late to start a hunt. Guess it’s
turnips.
MAD
We should talk ‘bout that goat.
AUGUSTA
Her name’s Hatty.

MAD
(on “name’s”)
I know her name.

(CONTINUED)

43.

AUGUSTA
Then don’t call her “that goat.”
MAD
Just ‘cause you give it a name don’t mean
we can’t eat it.
AUGUSTA
We need the milk.
MAD
We need the meat.
AUGUSTA
We got the vegetables and hominy -MAD
That won’t keep us strong.
It’s a stand off. And then -AUGUSTA
We got anything to drink?
Yeah.

MAD

Beat.
Goat’s milk.

MAD (CONT’D)

AUGUSTA
That’s not what I meant.
INT. KEEPING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
They both stare down A JAR OF MOONSHINE.
MAD
How you know ‘bout this?
AUGUSTA
Whore showed me.
MAD
That’s why you got sick.
I ‘suppose.

AUGUSTA

MAD
And you wanna do it again?
(CONTINUED)

44.

AUGUSTA
You never had this?
Unh-uh.

MAD

AUGUSTA
It seems odd considerin’ it all came back
up but yes, I want some more.
Augusta gets two glasses. And then she pours.
MAD
Jesus ain’t gonna be happy ‘bout this.
AUGUSTA
Tthey a lot things right now Jesus ain’t
happy ‘bout.
Augusta raises her glass. She gestures for Mad to raise
hers too.
Mad raises it.
And then Augusta downs hers.
Mad does the same and then COUGHS and twists up her face.
Augusta grins.
INT. KEEPING ROOM - AFTERNOON
Mad and Augusta are now DRUNK.
AUGUSTA
Gets easier more you drink.
MAD
Gets real easier.
AUGUSTA
I like the way I feel.
MAD
Bill was the only one your Daddy let
drink it. He come back at night stinkin’
and proud.
AUGUSTA
You was with him? Bill.
Beat.
(CONTINUED)

45.

I was.

MAD

AUGUSTA
You wanted to have his babies.
Oh, lord.

MAD

AUGUSTA
You miss him?
I do.
Was he --

MAD
AUGUSTA

Augusta stops herself.
Go on.

MAD

Beat.
MAD (CONT’D)
With this moonshine in me I’m fixed to
answer any question you got.
AUGUSTA
You real sad?
MAD
We all real sad.
Augusta gets a dreamy girl look on her face like she’s
fixing to ask something blue.
AUGUSTA
What’s it like?
Oh no.

MAD

AUGUSTA
You said you’d -MAD
I never did understand why you didn’t go
with one of them boys that wanted to.
Augusta considers.

(CONTINUED)

46.

AUGUSTA
When mama died havin’ Louise, it never
occurred to me to be the woman somewhere
else. Hadn’t been for you I wouldn’ta
known nothin’ ‘bout bein’ a woman.
Mad looks right at Augusta.
AUGUSTA (CONT’D)
I watched you. I listened. You were kind.
I tried.

MAD

The two women lock eyes. And then, Mad gives in.
MAD (CONT’D)
Alright... what you wanna know?
AUGUSTA
How’s it feel?
MAD
You’ll know -AUGUSTA
-- but what if I don’t. What if all the
men kill all the other men? What if it’s
the end of the world and we the only ones
left?
MAD
It ain’t the end of the world -AUGUSTA
I think ‘bout all the women sittin’ in
houses now. Were supposed to be taken,
but ain’t. Learned to shoot a gun fore
they learned to bed. Learned to be men
instead ‘uh wives.
Mad hears her. She thinks about it. And then she motions
for Augusta to pour her another shot.
She does.
They drink.
MAD
It’s scary. It feels good, but it’s
scary. It hurts! But good hurts. Like
ridin’ a horse. Or shootin’ a gun.

(CONTINUED)

47.

AUGUSTA
You didn’t ever shoot no gun -MAD
Well, what’s it feel like?
Augusta thinks.
AUGUSTA
Feels powerful -Yeah -And scary.

MAD
AUGUSTA

MAD
Mmmhhhhmmm -AUGUSTA
But the kind you want n’ not the kind you
don’t -Yeah --

MAD

AUGUSTA
And it hurts -MAD
That’s right -AUGUSTA
But I like it -MAD
That’s what I’m talkin’ bout -AUGUSTA
It’s like shootin’ a gun?
Yes ma’am.

MAD

A beat. She SMILES.
AUGUSTA
Least I done that.
Mad takes the bottle and pours them each some more.
And then -(CONTINUED)

48.

A NOISE, directly behind them. They turn to see...
LOUISE.
She’s just standing there. Like a GHOST.
Augusta and Mad stare at her. She looks like she might
fall over. They move quickly to her, help her to the
table, sit her down.
They sit down, too. Staring at her.
Waiting.
LOUISE
I’m... hungry.
MAD
Did she say...
...hungry?

AUGUSTA

Mad and Augusta break into NOISES OF RAPTURE. Shouting
and hollering and dancing around the room.
AUGUSTA (CONT’D)
She’s hungry!
MAD
What did you say?!
I’m hungry.

LOUISE

MAD
Say it again!
Louise manages a small SMILE. And in the loudest voice
she can muster:
I’m hungry!

LOUISE

INT. KEEPING ROOM - EVENING
Mad is at the stove, cooking FURIOUSLY.
MAD
I’m gonna cook you somethin’ so good,
Louise. Come-back-from-the-dead stew,
that’s what. Come-back-from-the-dead
stew! Best stew I ever made.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)

49.
MAD (CONT'D)
Beef heart n’ chicken breast. Prettiest
vegetables you ever saw.
Augusta gets up and goes over to the cabinets. She pulls
out the DRIED SAGE she brought back.
She takes it to Mad.
AUGUSTA
For a little flavor.
Mad takes it. They both look down into the pot.
Inside the pot, it’s just RABBIT BONES and TURNIPS
floating around in some water.
Augusta goes and sits with Louise. She stares at her.
Louise has her head down on the table.
Mad starts to sing a song while she cooks. It’s about -of course -- Come-back-from-the-dead stew.
Augusta touches Louise’s hair like something you’re not
supposed to touch.
Augusta puts her head down next to Louise’s. They take
each other in.
Augusta smiles a contented, drunken smile.
EXT. ROAD NEAR CALEB’S - EARLY MORNING
It’s empty, as before.
The Black Rider and his horse come down the road. They
reach Caleb’s.
EXT. CALEB’S - SAME
A man, a woman, and a horse lie dead in the street.
Another body lies across the PORCH, and another is
propped up against the building, a streak of blood
smeared down above his head. Both are old men.
The Black Rider goes to the man’s body closest to him,
lying in the street, and rolls him over. It’s Caleb.
Then he goes to the body of a WOMAN. It’s Moll. Eyes
wide, lips still smeared with blood. He closes her
eyelids, makes the sign of the CROSS.
(CONTINUED)

50.

Finally, he goes to the horse. He comes around the front
and sees it’s proud, dead face.
...Fern?

BLACK RIDER

He looks up, eyes searching.
INT. FARMHOUSE / BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING
Augusta splashes water on her face from a PORCELAIN
BASIN, wipes it with a cloth, takes a deep breath. She’s
hung over.
She looks back at Mad and Louise, asleep in the bed
together. Then she looks past them, to the window. The
morning air creeping in.
A sudden uneasiness...
She grabs a BLANKET.
INT. FARMHOUSE / FRONT HALL - SAME
Augusta walks to the door, opens it.
She stands in the doorway wrapped in the BLANKET, bracing
herself against the cold morning that comes rushing in.
She sees:
-- The GREEN HILLS
-- Clusters of TREES
-- Branches SWAYING, as if moved by some INVISIBLE HAND
As she stands there, watching the world...
The uneasiness overwhelms her.
She’s been so focused on Louise that she hadn’t really
thought about what would happen next. But then she
remembers and suddenly she feels a shift in the ground
beneath her, in the air around her -SOMETHING’S COMING.
EXT. ROAD - AFTERNOON
CLOSE ON: The red TONGUE of a tired dog, PANTING.
(CONTINUED)

51.

It’s Battle.
We widen out to reveal Henry and Moses as they come
walking up behind him. Moses walks ahead of Henry, who
lags behind holding a JUG of MOONSHINE, lip still CUT
from where Moll bit him.
MOSES
Didn’t realize you needed your mouth to
walk proper.
HENRY
Whore damn near bit my lip off. I’m all
dizzy.
MOSES
Just keep drinking that shine. It’ll stop
hurting soon.
HENRY
Ain’t enough shine in this bottle fix
what I got.
MOSES
No one suffers but you.
HENRY
If you were the one bit we’d still be
sitting back at the whorehouse instead uh
moving.
MOSES
I don’t know that I’d call what you’re
doing moving.
HENRY
You sure we’re going the right way?
MOSES
Road only goes one way.
HENRY
You know as well as I do
you can go any way you want

MOSES
(on “want to”)
We’re on the right trail.

HENRY
Maybe we should stop a minute.
MOSES
Maybe you should quit acting like she bit
off your foot.
Henry sits down right where he is.
(CONTINUED)

52.

Fine.

MOSES (CONT’D)

Moses stops too. Shakes his head.
MOSES (CONT’D)
We can rest a while. We can rest.
He looks up at the sun.
HENRY
Wish we had some horses, Mose.
MOSES
Can’t be too far off now.
He takes off his hat. Pushes back his hair. Feels the sun
on his face. Puts it back on.
MOSES (CONT’D)
What’s that story about the traveler lost
his horse? And the horse knew how to get
home but the man didn’t?
HENRY
I don’t know.
MOSES
The man would just get on the horse and
go to town and come home at night. Never
thought twice about the ride, just went.
And one day he comes out to the post and
his horse is just gone. And he’s
wandering around, looking everywhere, but
he’s not looking for his house, he’s
looking for the horse cause the horse’s
the only one who knows how to get home.
HENRY
I don’t know this story.
MOSES
And his looking takes him so far that one
day he ends up in a new town. And in that
new town, he finds a new wife and a new
horse. New house. And he’s happier than
before. Happier than he’s ever been.
Beat.

(CONTINUED)

53.

MOSES (CONT’D)
And then, years later, long after he’s
forgotten about his wandering days he’s
out on his new horse, going home to his
new wife and he sees a woman riding down
the road on a familiar horse. And he
swears he’s seen that horse before and
the horse swears he’s seen that man
before. But the man and the woman? They
don’t know each other. Can’t place each
other even though they were married for
20 years. And the man, he goes home to
his new wife. And the woman, she goes
home to her new husband. But the horse,
the horse can’t stop his wondering.
SUDDENLY Battle calls to them. The men turn and take
notice of his stillness:
He’s sitting right next to a CLUMP OF PRICKLY BUSHES.
MOSES (CONT’D)
What is it, boy?
Battle WHIMPERS.
MOSES (CONT’D)
You got something there?
Battle YELPS.
As Moses approaches Battle, he looks up and sees what the
dog sees:
A SWATCH OF WORN FLOWERED FABRIC
Caught in the branches of the bush.
It’s from Augusta’s dress.
Moses grabs the fabric off of the bush, holds it to his
nose and a takes a deep, long inhale.
HENRY
What’s he got?
Moses puts it in his pocket. Looks up.
MOSES
Let’s just say we’re going the right way.

EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT
The MOON is high. Everything is STILL.
The Farm is bathed in MOONLIGHT.
BLACK LEAVES rub together in the night breeze. SHADOWS
throw long and tall across the house.
INT. FARMHOUSE / BEDROOM - THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
Augusta shakes Mad AWAKE.
What -Shhhhhh.

MAD
AUGUSTA

MAD
Why wake me just to be quiet?
-- listen --

AUGUSTA

They listen together.
NOTHING.
MAD
Probably a ghost.
AUGUSTA
Come have a look with me?
INT. FARMHOUSE / STAIRCASE - MOMENTS LATER
Augusta, RIFLE in hand. Mad right behind her. Quietly,
they make their way down the stairs.
They hear a STRANGE NOISE. Like a tearing or ripping.
It’s coming from outside.
EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT
Augusta and Mad move in the darkness.
The sounds of a struggle -RIP!
(CONTINUED)

55.

A SNARL as flesh and muscle TEAR.
EXT. FIELD - SAME
Augusta and Mad approach the pen to see:
A CREATURE is tearing Hatty apart.
It’s dark, but she’s sure as sure it’s the RACCOON.
Augusta AIMS, SHOOTS and HITS.
The creature WHIMPERS and COLLAPSES.
Augusta moves towards it. Mad stays back. When she gets
close enough she goes to cry out, but stifles it well and
BACKS AWAY in FEAR...
And then, we see it too:
The dying creature is not a raccoon. It’s BATTLE.
AUGUSTA
Get back inside.
MAD
What was that?
A WHISTLE. It’s familiar.
AUGUSTA
Inside. Now -HENRY (O.C.)
Who’s firing? Show yourself!
At the sound of a man’s voice Mad and Augusta exchange a
look and run inside.
MOSES (O.C.)
Battle! PHFT! PHFT! Battle!
INT. FARMHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
Mad BOLTS the BACK DOOR. And they run up the stairs.
INT. FARMHOUSE / BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
The breathless women clamber into the bedroom.
They wake Louise.
(CONTINUED)

56.

Wake up.

AUGUSTA

Louise wakes, slowly.
LOUISE
What’s goin’ on?
MAD
We got men here -AUGUSTA
Soldiers. Yankees.
MAD
How you know that?
MOSES (O.C.)
You shot the dog!
Augusta motions to Mad and Louise to be quiet. As the men
continue singing and talking, she moves to the window and
looks down, trying to see where exactly they are. But she
can’t find them.
HENRY (O.C.)
(singing)
He was just a dog.
Same as you and me.
Quickly, she RELOADS her rifle.
HENRY (CONT’D)
(singing)
You went and shot him down.
Couldn’t let him be.
MOSES (O.S.)
Who else you got in there? Any mencowards? Or negros?
Augusta moves back to the others. Henry keeps singing
under their dialogue:
HENRY
And now there’s no more drink.
And there’s no more dog.
I only have this gun.
And I’m through my song.
The women whisper, and FAST:
AUGUSTA
We got any other guns?
(CONTINUED)

57.

MAD
Downstairs. In one of the drawers.
AUGUSTA
I’ll get it and come back.
MAD
Let’s get to the Keepin’ Room.
AUGUSTA
We ain’t leavin’ this house.
MAD
Too many doors and windows and rooms -AUGUSTA
We goin’ to fight.
LOUISE
I don’t wanna fight -MAD
We can hide. They don’t know we here.
AUGUSTA
They know someone shot their dog and they
gonna come lookin’.
MAD
How you know what dog belong to what
Yankees?
AUGUSTA
‘Cause they followed me.
Mad doesn’t know what to say when -SUDDENLY -BANG BANG BANG!
Someone POUNDS on the SIDE OF THE HOUSE.
Louise goes to SCREAM. Mad covers her mouth.
BANG BANG BANG!
Once she’s sure Mad has Louise under control, Augusta
moves to the door.
Don’t go --

LOUISE

(CONTINUED)

58.

AUGUSTA
You want them up here?
No.

LOUISE

AUGUSTA
Then I gotta go.
INT. FARMHOUSE / STAIRS - NIGHT
Augusta creeps down the stairs. The BANGING continues.
HENRY (O.C.)
Shine’s all gone. I could use a drink!
MOSES
We been knocking, but nobody come down to
invite us in.
And just as she reaches the bottom...
It STOPS.
She waits a few moments...
AND THEN -A bullet RIPS through a wall across the house. The sound
of Henry LAUGHING WILDLY.
Augusta stays low, until -ALL OF A SUDDEN -BULLET after BULLET after BULLET comes ripping through
the walls. She can’t believe it’s only two men, how they
keep coming.
She has to get on the ground to keep safe.
The BULLETS RIP through the walls of the house, one after
the other.
And then as suddenly as it started...
It’s OVER.
She waits.
And then -CRASH!
(CONTINUED)

59.

The sound of BREAKING GLASS from the FRONT RIGHT window.
She darts to -INT. FARMHOUSE / FRONT RIGHT ROOM - SAME
Henry has stuffed a RAG ON FIRE into the remains of the
JUG OF MOONSHINE and thrown it through the window.
A FIRE now blazes on the floor just inside the window.
Augusta puts down her rifle and looks around for
something to put out the fire. There’s nothing. Thinking
fast, she pulls off her nightgown and puts out the fire
with it.
Once it’s out she picks up her gun.
She moves through the house NAKED, rifle at the ready.
Another window BREAKS on the other side of the house.
She runs to -INT. FARMHOUSE / FRONT LEFT ROOM - SAME
In the WINDOW:
A HAND creeps through the broken glass and goes to open
the window from the inside.
Augusta takes aims at the hand. She steadies herself as
best she can and when she’s ready, she takes a step
towards the window, takes a long deep breath...
And SHOOTS.
The hand RECOILS as the bullet passes through the tender
area between thumb and forefinger.
She can hear Henry SCREAMING in the night.
And she makes a break for it.
INT. FARMHOUSE / FRONT ROOM - SAME
Augusta finds the SMALL BOX by the door on the one TABLE
that’s left. It’s filled with mostly trinkets and odds
and ends, things that may have belonged to her mother, a
long time ago...
(CONTINUED)

60.

But the gun isn’t there.
Quickly, quietly she moves to a LARGER BOX by the door.
And then she finds it: a small SINGLE-SHOT REVOLVER.
With a SINGLE BALL and BLACK POWDER.
EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT
Henry holds his arm to his chest. He is moving quickly,
but comes to rest on an exterior wall of the house.
Moses is right behind him.
HENRY
(under his breath)
Shit shit shit!
Beat.
HENRY (CONT’D)
Shit, Mose -He shows his hand. All bloody and mangled. Moses winces
at the sight of it.
HENRY (CONT’D)
Women taking all kinds of parts of me
today.
INT. FARMHOUSE / BEDROOM - SAME
Augusta BURSTS into the room.
This conversation happens VERY QUICKLY:
LOUISE
What’s happenin’?
AUGUSTA
(to Mad)
This your gun.
Mad takes it in her hands. Frightened.
LOUISE
Why you naked?
AUGUSTA
Fire. Had to put it out.
(CONTINUED)

61.

What?

LOUISE

Augusta opens the wardrobe and pulls on a pair of
bloomers and a blouse as she talks. She also takes a
POUCH of GUN POWDER that was tied to her dress and ties
it to the blouse she now wears.
AUGUSTA
I gotta reload. Do as I do.
Augusta hands her the ball and the powder.
AUGUSTA (CONT’D)
Powder goes in.
They both do it. Mad watches her so closely -AUGUSTA (CONT’D)
Then the ball.
Augusta does it. Mad copies her motion.
AUGUSTA (CONT’D)
Push down like this.
Augusta drops the ball in. So does Mad.
AUGUSTA (CONT’D)
Pull this back -Augusta’s just showing her how, but Mad actually does it.
Mad pulls her hand away as if the words have reminded her
that she wasn’t about to fire.
She looks back to Augusta.
AUGUSTA (CONT’D)
You pull this and hold real steady.
Mad nods.
EXT. FARMHOUSE - SAME
Moses crouches next to Henry, his gun down. He’s taken
the tail of his shirt from his pants and ripped part of
it off at the bottom to wrap around Henry’s HAND.
MOSES
(calling out)
Girl! We will give you to the count of
ten to come on out or we’re coming in.
(CONTINUED)

62.

They wait for a response.
NOTHING.
Moses motions for Henry to go around front.
Henry nods, he goes.
And with that Moses heads around back -One.

MOSES (CONT’D)

INT. FARMHOUSE / BEDROOM - SAME
Two.

MOSES (O.C.)

The women listen and then -AUGUSTA
I’m gonna try n’ draw ‘em away from the
house -Three.

MOSES (O.C.)

Augusta looks at her sister one last time and then she
goes to the door.
AUGUSTA
You bar this door behind me.
Four.

MOSES (O.C.)

Mad looks at the gun and then back up at Augusta.
AUGUSTA
If a man comes through this door -- no
matter what -- you shoot.
She goes. Mad BARS the door behind her. She turns and
looks at Louise.
Louise backs up into the far CORNER. Terrified.
EXT. FARMHOUSE / BACK - SAME
Moses moves across the back of the house. He’s low,
creeping along below the windows.
(CONTINUED)

63.

Five.

MOSES

He stops and settles, crouching by the BACK DOOR.
EXT. FARMHOUSE / FRONT - SAME
Henry moves to the FRONT DOOR. His RIFLE across his BACK.
His PISTOL in his HAND.
Six.

MOSES (O.C.)

INT. FARMHOUSE / BEDROOM - SAME
Louise is huddled in the corner.
Mad stands by the door, pistol drawn.
Seven.

MOSES (O.C.)

EXT. FARMHOUSE / BACK - SAME
Moses still crouches.
Eight.

MOSES

And then he HEARS something.
He moves away from the door, along the back of the house.
He looks around the corner to the left towards the well
and the tree beyond, but he doesn’t see anything.
MOSES(CONT’D)
(throwing his voice in the
other direction)
...Nine...
He waits.
He sees SOMETHING MOVE just behind the WELL, away from
the house.
And then it disappears behind a TREE.
He moves towards it...

64.

EXT. FARMHOUSE - SAME
Hiding behind the tree is...
AUGUSTA. Rifle up.
She waits. Breaths heavy.
AUGUSTA
(to herself)
Where’s ten?
INT. FARMHOUSE / BEDROOM - SAME
Louise is still huddled in the corner, Mad remains by the
door. They hear GLASS BREAKING below them. FOOTSTEPS.
Louise tries to keep it in, but a small whimper gets out.
MAD
(whispered)
Louise. Don’t make no sound. Nothin’. You
hear?
Louise nods.
INT. FARMHOUSE / FRONT ROOM - SAME
Henry moves through the big front room of the house,
surprised by how few possessions there are.
How empty it is.
He makes his way to the -INT. FARMHOUSE / STAIRS - CONTINUOUS
And he begins to climb. Pistol still drawn.
He takes the first step carefully, quietly, slowly,
careful not to give himself away.
He’s a GHOST.
EXT. FARMHOUSE - SAME
Augusta moves from behind the tree and darts over to a
WAGON that sits near the BARN, squatting behind it. She
feels that Moses is near.
And then we see him, creeping towards where she hides.
(CONTINUED)

65.

AUGUSTA
(calling out)
You followed me.
Taken aback, he didn’t know she knew he was there.
I did.

MOSES

He moves a little closer. Gun at the ready.
AUGUSTA
Why didn’t you kill me with Caleb and
that woman? Why not kill me now?
MOSES
Want to keep you a while.
INT. FARMHOUSE / STAIRS - SAME
Henry’s FOOT comes down on the top step, and -INT. FARMHOUSE / BEDROOM - SAME
CREEEEAK.
Louise presses deeper into the corner. Mad steels
herself, shakily holds the gun -Louise WHIMPERS again.
Mad turns to her and with her eyes begs her to hush -INT. FARMHOUSE / HALLWAY - SAME
Henry STOPS. Listens. He’s heard something.
Slowly, he moves towards the bedroom door, towards the
source of the sound.
His hand REACHES OUT to the door -It’s BOLTED -He STEPS BACK...
WAITS, and...
SLAM!
He BUSTS it OPEN -(CONTINUED)

66.

The SLAT OF WOOD holding the door BREAKS IN HALF -And there’s Mad, standing between him and Louise, PISTOL
in hand.
And she PULLS THE TRIGGER -CLICK. CLICK.
NOTHING.
For a moment, Henry is taken aback. He didn’t expect to
find these women here. With a gun, no less.
Mad pulls the trigger again -Louise begins to CRY in the corner -AND THEN -Henry HOLSTERS his PISTOL, walks over to Mad, who keeps
pulling the trigger...
...and he takes the gun out of her hands.
He opens the chamber, sticks his finger in.
HENRY
Damp powder. Must be as old as the gun.
And then SUDDENLY -VIOLENTLY -He takes the BUTT of the gun and strikes Mad clear across
the face, knocking her out.
Henry turns his attention to Louise, still cowering in
the corner. She’s SOBBING quietly, now.
They stand there.
Motionless.
EXT. FARMHOUSE - SAME
Moses stands, his eyes on the Wagon.
MOSES
Something about you makes me wanna sit
down.

(CONTINUED)

67.

AUGUSTA
Then why you come here like you want a
war?
MOSES
Don’t know how to stop.
INT. FARMHOUSE / BEDROOM - SAME
The BUTT of Henry’s RIFLE as it comes down across the
door where the wooden slat had been. He’s making sure
that no one else can get in...
...or out.
He turns and looks directly at Louise.
EXT. FARMHOUSE - SAME
Cautiously, Moses moves nearer to the Wagon. Gun ready.
MOSES
Come on out now, let me see you.
He’s close now. Augusta can feel it.
MOSES (CONT’D)
Why don’t we put down these guns?
Beat.
MOSES (CONT’D)
We can be closer without them.
He lowers his gun...
AND SUDDENLY -Augusta COMES OUT from behind the Wagon and FIRES.
Moses is HIT IN THE STOMACH. Falling, he FIRES BACK,
hitting her in the SHOULDER.
Both of them fall to the ground.
INT. FARMHOUSE / BEDROOM - SAME
Henry and Louise hear the ECHO OF THE TWO SHOTS.
And after that, it’s just quiet.
(CONTINUED)

68.

HENRY
Maybe it’s just you and me, now.
Louise shoves herself even further into the corner.
HENRY (CONT’D)
(touches his pistol)
If you don’t stop moving, I might have to
shoot you.
She stops.
HENRY (CONT’D)
I don’t want to shoot you.
SUDDENLY -Louise STANDS -Henry is on the other side of the bed, not sure which way
she’ll go -Louise prepares to make her move -Henry is enjoying this -And then she DARTS over the top of the bed towards the
door, but Henry lunges toward her, pulling her down onto
the bed.
He FORCES her nightgown up with his good hand. Some of
the blood from his bandaged hand gets on her skin.
Louise CRIES out. Henry pulls the upper part of her
nightgown up and stuffs it in her mouth. She GAGS.
She tries to rise up, but she is so weak, and he is a
man. He pushes her back down and holds her there.
HENRY (CONT’D)
Don’t make me hurt you.
And then, there is one small moment, just one, where it
doesn’t feel wrong to Louise, when she goes to a place in
her mind where she realizes that this -- this -- is what
it feels like to have a man inside you.
She submits.
This is not something to look at, not ever.

69.

EXT. FARMHOUSE - SAME
Moses stands, slowly.
He looks down at his GUT. BLOODY as hell.
He hobbles over to where Augusta lies. Stands above her.
This isn’t what he wanted.
He looks down at her -She’s not moving -AND THEN -WHACK!
She slams him in the head with the butt of her RIFLE,
knocking him down.
INT. FARMHOUSE / BEDROOM - SAME
Henry FINISHES and falls down on top of Louise. And for a
moment it’s quiet and still.
He pushes himself off of her, back to his feet.
Louise doesn’t move. It’s hard to tell if she’s even
alive. He looks at her lying there.
In this moment, she looks like the young girl that she
is. And just as he’s realizing what he’s done he hears
the familiar click of his own rifle’s HAMMERS and -BANG!
Henry is shot in the back, straight through the middle of
his chest.
He falls forward onto the bed, onto Louise, DEAD.
And we TURN TO SEE:
Mad, standing by the door, Henry’s RIFLE poised and
smoking.
EXT. FARMHOUSE - SAME
Augusta has slung her rifle slung across her back and is
slinging Moses’ around too when she hears -THE ECHO OF THE SHOT.
(CONTINUED)

70.

She grabs his pistol and fueled by FEAR, makes for the
house as fast as she can.
INT. FARMHOUSE / BEDROOM - SAME
Louise struggles to pull herself out from underneath
Henry, but he’s so big and dead and she’s so tired and
weak and she’s pushing and shoving and she starts to
POUND on him with her fists and now it’s not about trying
to get out it’s about trying to hurt him hurt him for
hurting her for hurting all of them and she’s hitting him
so hard now and she’s GRUNTING and CRYING and -Mad moves to her and tries to wrestle her down.
MAD
Enough. Enough. Enough.
Louise won’t stop but Mad can tell she’s weakening.
MAD (CONT’D)
(almost a whisper)
Enough.
Finally, Louise submits. Mad helps her out from under
Henry and holds her close.
And with that -Augusta comes clambering into the room, Moses’ pistol at
the ready, all blood and dirt, the two rifles slung
across her back.
She stops when she sees the soldier dead and Mad holding
Louise.
She fears she knows what has happened.
There is nothing to say.
Augusta goes to the two women and wraps her arms around
them. Mad sees Augusta’s wound but says nothing.
The women stay this way for a moment.
INT. KEEPING ROOM - AN HOUR OR TWO BEFORE DAWN
Mad, Augusta and Louise come quickly through the door.
Augusta has both Moses’ rifle and her own slung across
her back. She has his pistol, too.
(CONTINUED)

71.

Mad has Henry’s rifle.
Louise’s nightgown is covered in blood. So is Louise.
Augusta sits Louise down.
Mad LOCKS the BOLT on the door.
Augusta grabs another chair, pulls it over and sits with
Louise. She touches her sister’s face. Trying to figure
out what she can possibly do to help her.
Mad goes to the cabinet and pulls out the jug of
moonshine.
Mad pours the moonshine on Augusta’s wound.
AAAGGGHHH --

AUGUSTA

Augusta picks up the moonshine. Drinks.
Mad wraps the cloth around the burned wound.
Augusta looks at her sister. She pushes the moonshine
over to her. Nods at her to take a drink.
Louise hesitates...
And then, she drinks.
She quickly pulls her mouth away. Coughs. Sputters.
Mad ties off the bandage and finally, she sits down.
And they just sit there.
MAD
At my second farm, there was this one
shed we wasn’t allowed at. All the other
buildings had their jobs. One for feed.
One for tools. But there was this one
shed that we was told never to go in. Not
to play near it. Not to get curious. We
made up all sorts of stories. Gold.
Ghosts. God. Then, one day when I was
‘bout ten the man told me to go to the
shed.
She remembers that moment of happiness.
MAD (CONT’D)
I was goin’ to the shed. I would get to
know.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)

72.
MAD (CONT’D)
I walked to the shed, my heart comin’ out
my dress. I was gonna get to know. I was
gonna get to know. I was gonna be the one
tell all the others.
Beat.
MAD (CONT’D)
I open the door. Only thing in there was
a low cot and no windows. I stood in
there a minute so unsure. So sad that
that was all. Wonderin’ why we wasn’t
supposed to know for so long. And then
the man come in.
Beat.
MAD (CONT’D)
And he had me. He was so big and I was so
small. So small that I didn’t even know
what was happenin’. That was the first
time. And there were many more. Some
times they cut the baby out. Other times,
they kept ‘em. I don’t know where they
are now.
Beat.
MAD (CONT’D)
There many kinds of monsters in this
world, you never know which one goin’ to
be yours. Don’t know what happened to
mine. Probably died old and happy. But
yours -Louise looks up at Mad.
LOUISE
You killed him -MAD
That’s right.
Beat.
MAD (CONT’D)
Your monster’s dead.
Louise looks at Mad in a way she never has.
And Mad looks right back.
And then they hear a NOISE behind the Keeping Room.
(CONTINUED)

73.

Heavy FEET on the earth.
Augusta motions for Mad to grab Henry’s rifle. Augusta
grabs hers.
She hands Louise Moses’ pistol.
Augusta points at the DOOR. Points at HERSELF and points
LEFT. Points at MAD and points RIGHT. Points at LOUISE
and then gestures for her to STAY PUT.
Everyone understands.
Mad opens the door, carefully and quietly.
Augusta goes around to the left and Mad goes around to
the right. Louise closes the door behind them.
She picks up the pistol. Regards it. Struggles for a
moment, but then she COCKS it.
EXT. KEEPING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Mad stalks around one side.
EXT. KEEPING ROOM - SAME
Augusta stalks around the other.
EXT. KEEPING ROOM - SAME
Mad comes around the back and sees the BACK of a UNION
SOLDIER standing there.
He hears her...
Mad thrusts the RIFLE out in front of her, steadying
herself...
THE SOLDIER TURNS...
But it’s not Moses...
...it’s the Black Rider.
THIS IS BILL.
What happens next is VERY FAST:
Recognition moves over both of their faces -(CONTINUED)

74.

Mad lowers her gun, in SHOCK -Bill can’t believe he’s made it back, can’t believe she’s
really standing there -BANG!
Bill FALLS FORWARD.
THUD.
SILENCE.
Augusta stands behind Bill, drops her RIFLE to her side.
She SMILES. It’s over.
Mad is in complete shock. She can’t move.
UNTIL -She emits a low MOAN, a moan of infinite SORROW and
SADNESS and LOSS.
She runs to Bill, kneels down next to him.
His eyes search her face, moving wildly, as if the very
act will keep him alive.
MAD
Shhhh. Shhhhhh. Shhhhh, baby.
AUGUSTA
What you doin’?
Augusta moves to them.
And then, like a PUNCH TO THE GUT, Augusta KNOWS. She
drops the gun. Falls down to her knees.
MAD
You come back.
BILL
Just wanted to hear that old voice again.
He reaches his hand up to touch her face, but he can’t
quite make it. Mad grabs his hand and helps him the rest
of the way.
She holds his hand with her hand to her face.
BILL (CONT’D)
It’s over. It’s all over.
(CONTINUED)

75.

MAD
What you mean?
BILL
Take shelter. They comin’.
His eyes stop their wandering.
Mad leans in and kisses his lips. HARD.
She puts her face to his face.
His breathing is so thin...
And then he’s GONE.
We stay here for a bit, in SILENCE.
And then Mad takes the pistol from Bill’s hand, gets up,
and walks back into the Keeping Room.
Augusta doesn’t move. And then, she knows she must.
If that wasn’t Moses...
INT. KEEPING ROOM - SAME
Louise crouches in the corner. Pistol at the ready.
Mad walks in and Louise lowers her gun.
Mad sits at the table. Silent.
Is it done?

LOUISE

Mad remains silent.
...Mad?

LOUISE (CONT’D)

EXT. FARMHOUSE - SAME
Augusta moves over to the Wagon, to where Moses...
His BLOOD soaks the earth...
His HAT lies on the ground...
BUT HE IS NOT THERE.
She looks every which way. He’s nowhere.

76.

INT. KEEPING ROOM - DAWN
Mad sits there. Still silent.
Where’s --

LOUISE

Augusta comes in, quickly closing the door behind her and
then BOLTING it. She turns and presses up against it, her
heart racing.
She looks at Mad.
LOUISE (CONT’D)
What’s goin’ on?
MAD
(to herself, real quiet)
He come back.
Augusta goes to say something -MAD (CONT’D)
I ain’t angry with you, Augusta! I’m
angry cause I came close to killin’ him
myself!
Augusta moves right next to Mad. Mad grabs her hand real
hard.
LOUISE
But we wanted him dead...
MAD
(biting back feeling)
Glad it was you instead uh me. Bill would
never forgive me if I’s the one done it.
Louise hears Bill’s name.
Mad --

AUGUSTA

MAD
When you gonna learn what don’t happen
don’t matter?
Beat.
MAD (CONT’D)
You just go on.
She takes Bill’s gun. Regards it.
(CONTINUED)

77.

MAD (CONT’D)
Might be another man out there. Ain’t no
time to think on love.
AUGUSTA
There is another man out there.
MAD
We ain’t goin’ to wait for him.
Beat.
MAD (CONT’D)
We goin’ out there to hunt him. And we
ain’t come back ‘til he ours.
EXT. KEEPING ROOM - MORNING
We’re WIDE on the farm and the surrounding buildings.
And save for the symphony of southern bugs...
It’s DEAD QUIET. And then we see -Our three women EMERGE from the keeping room and move
through the dawn.
EXT. FARMHOUSE - SAME
They are spread across the field, moving towards us.
Separately, but also as one.
Their RIFLES lead the way.
Louise carries Henry’s rifle. Mad carries Bill’s.
They move towards the wagon where Moses was, hoping to
discover a trail to where he’s gone.
They STOP.
Augusta finds SOME BLOOD and then a few steps away a bit
MORE. She motions to start moving again.
In SILENCE, the women follow.
EXT. FARMHOUSE - SAME
Augusta tracks the blood to the back of the house. The
BACK DOOR is open. A BLOODY HAND PRINT smeared across the
outside wall of the house.
(CONTINUED)

78.

She looks back to the others.
With their eyes, they agree to keep going.
INT. FARMHOUSE - SAME
The BLOOD leads from the door to the stairs. Augusta
follows the trail, the women behind her.
They mount the stairs.
INT. FARMHOUSE / HALLWAY - SAME
BLOOD is smeared across the DOOR FRAME of the bedroom.
The door is slightly ajar.
Augusta takes a BREATH -Pushes the door open with the NOSE of her RIFLE...
INT. FARMHOUSE / BEDROOM - SAME
But Moses is NOT THERE.
And then she sees -Henry’s BODY lying on the bed.
Augusta searches the room for an answer, for something,
anything to tell her what to do, and then she notices
that Henry’s PISTOL has been removed from his HOLSTER.
And there’s fresh BLOOD on it.
Quickly, Augusta moves out of the room -INT. FARMHOUSE / HALLWAY - SAME
-- following the trail of BLOOD -Mad and Louise stand STOCK STILL -And Augusta looks back down at the blood in front of the
bedroom door and realizes -The spots were him COMING...
AND GOING.
Louise and Mad look down and see it too.

79.

EXT. FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Augusta comes out the door, then Louise, then Mad.
The women look down at the ground. BLOOD. But -There is ANOTHER trail, headed in ANOTHER direction...
AWAY from the house.
Augusta knows he’s not too far now.
The others keep pace. They slowly approach...
THE FENCE.
There is BLOOD painted across one of its posts -She looks DOWN.
And on the WOODEN WALKWAY...
MORE BLOOD leads AWAY, out and around, back to the place
they just came from, back to the -EXT. KEEPING ROOM - SAME
The door is slightly ajar. A LIGHT pours out from within.
Augusta stops. Her breaths are HEAVY.
The others stop too.
She takes a step CLOSER...
And ANOTHER.
And -MOSES (O.C.)
This is fine moonshine.
Augusta stops. Catches herself.
Holds it back as best she can.
AUGUSTA
Our daddy made it.
MOSES (O.C.)
Your daddy made fine moonshine.
She moves closer...
(CONTINUED)

80.

MOSES (O.C.) (CONT’D)
I’ve been waiting for you.
AUGUSTA
I was looking for you.
And closer still. She can see a SLIVER of him now,
sitting there, sitting at her table.
MOSES (O.C)
You found me.
I did.

AUGUSTA

MOSES (O.C.)
Saw Henry’s dead.
Your man?
He was.

AUGUSTA
MOSES

And she reaches the door.
She pushes it open all the way with the back of her arm,
gun still up, still ready.
And then, she sees all of him...
INT. KEEPING ROOM - SAME
Moses sits there, in the chair farthest from the door,
his gut and chest now COVERED in BLOOD. His wound is as
bad as she thought, spilling out red all over him.
The fire is dying behind him.
The JUG OF MOONSHINE sits on the table next to him. His
hand around her small glass.
His other hand is propped up on the table...
Henry’s PISTOL pointed right at her.
MOSES
I like this room.
AUGUSTA
I like it too.
She moves a little closer.
(CONTINUED)

81.

He lets her.
Mad and Louise move to the doorway, standing just barely
on the edge of the room. They don’t come in.
AUGUSTA (CONT’D)
What’s your name?
Moses.

MOSES

AUGUSTA
Like the baby.
Just like.

MOSES

AUGUSTA
...Why’re you doin’ this, Moses?
MOSES
Me an’ him are bummers. Sent on ahead to
forage the outlying land, look for food,
deserters, survivors. Whole army’s just
behind us. Already took Georgia. Uncle
Billy’s heading this way. Burning down
every thing in his path. Rest assured,
it’ll be cruel.
Mad and Louise exchange a look.
MOSES (CONT’D)
And the crueler it is the sooner it’ll be
over.
AUGUSTA
We can hold ‘em.
He smiles.
MOSES
Girl, I believe you can.
He takes a drink from his glass.
MOSES (CONT’D)
You know how many battles I fought in?
AUGUSTA
Don’t seem like many, easy as you went
down.

(CONTINUED)

82.

MOSES
No. It don’t. But it was. And yet, here I
sit -AUGUSTA
-- here you sit --- shit.

MOSES

Beat.
AUGUSTA
This is whatcha get for bein’ bad.
MOSES
North ain’t bad.
AUGUSTA
Didn’t say it was. Said you was.
MOSES
And you, you’re good.
AUGUSTA
Don’t know no more.
MOSES
Used to though.
She sits in the chair closest to the door, her gun still
trained on him. And his still trained on her.
AUGUSTA
Back when everyone was in the right place
it was easy to feel like I was good. Like
I was where I belonged. Like everyone
was. And then all things got moved and
once all things got moved it was hard to
know.
Moses considers.
MOSES
Most likely things won’t go back to where
they were. Rarely do.
Beat.
MOSES (CONT’D)
I’d like to know your name.
Augusta.

AUGUSTA
(CONTINUED)

83.

Augusta.

MOSES

Somehow that word, her name, the way she says it...
He opens his hand and lets the gun ROLL onto the table.
It surprises her. She looks at the gun, just lying there,
and then she looks back at him.
She lowers her gun. Just a little.
Louise goes to say something, she’s so AFRAID -But Mad stops her.
He coughs, but it sounds like CHOKING. Some BLOOD comes
up. He puts his hand to his LIP, looks at the blood on
his fingers, and then back at Augusta.
MOSES (CONT’D)
Things could be different.
Beat.
AUGUSTA
But they ain’t.
MOSES
I know it’s over. To tell the truth, I’m
heartened.
(beat)
Don’t know that I’d even know how to get
home from here.
He raises the glass to her. It hurts. He cringes -But he keeps it high. Just for her.
MOSES (CONT’D)
I’d very much appreciate it if you’d show
me the way.
Augusta steals herself. She knows what she has to do.
AUGUSTA
(You ready to go now?)
You bout finished your drink?
He lowers the glass to his lips -MOSES
(I am.)
Just abou -(CONTINUED)

84.

She SHOOTS him.
Louise steels herself against Mad.
Augusta lowers her gun, looks down...
And then she looks up at him, one last time.
EXT. FIELD - LATE MORNING
Henry’s body LANDS in a hole in the ground.
From BELOW, we see Mad and Augusta standing, looking in.
Augusta holds a SHOVEL at her side.
EXT. FIELD - LATER
Augusta stands by Moses’ body at the edge of the freshly
dug HOLE.
She squats down to pat his pockets and finds a small
purse with some coins, and then she finds a THE SCRAP OF
FABRIC FRO HER DRESS. She’s taken a back. It’s wrapped
around A TINTYPE of MOSES posing with AN OLDER COUPLE.
Perhaps it’s his parents. She looks at their faces, holds
the picture close to her eyes. She puts it back in his
pocket. She finds a few bullets, too. Takes them.
She looks at his face.
And then, with all her might, she rolls him into the same
hole as Henry, right on top of him.
EXT. FIELD - LATER
Mad sits next to Bill, who now lies on the edge of hole.
Mad doesn’t turn, she just feels Augusta behind her.
MAD
How strange he show up here lookin’ like
a Yankee.
Augusta’s about to say something when -MAD (CONT’D)
I reckon he joined up.
AUGUSTA
With them --

MAD
Maybe he was free.

Augusta understands.
(CONTINUED)

85.

AUGUSTA
And he came back.
MAD
I didn’t know people looked the same
whether they was dead or alive.
AUGUSTA
What do you mean?
MAD
He gone. But he don’t look so bad. Like
he’s sleepin’ maybe.
AUGUSTA
He look dead.
MAD
But he look gooooood.
Mad runs her hand down his face. Augusta smiles.
Mad goes to shove him in.
AUGUSTA
You sure you don’t wanna dig another
hole?
MAD
Ain’t time. Ain’t strength.
AUGUSTA
Don’t think he should go in the same
place as them.
MAD
Don’t worry. They ain’t goin’ to the same
place.
And with that, Mad goes to push Bill into the hole.
Augusta joins her and together they send him home.
INT. KEEPING ROOM - AFTERNOON
Louise sleeps in the corner. Augusta sits by her side.
Slowly, Louise wakes up.
They take each other in and then -MAD (O.C.)
Augusta! Augusta come out here!

86.

EXT. FARMHOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
Mad stands on a hill overlooking the land.
Augusta comes running and once she sees why Mad’s
calling, she slows down.
The two women stand, looking out. We stay on their
bewildered FACES, a mix of wonder and terror.
MAD
Looks like the sky’s on fire.
AUGUSTA
Looks like the whole world’s on fire.
They comin’.

MAD

INT. KEEPING ROOM - LATER
The faint SOUNDS OF WAR in the distance.
Mad and Louise sit at the table. Augusta paces back and
forth.
AUGUSTA
This is our home.
Louise takes Mad’s hand. Holds it tight.
LOUISE
This our home.
Mad holds tight back. She knows what Louise is trying to
say even if Louise doesn’t know quite how to say it.
BOOM! A cannon erupts in the distance.
AUGUSTA
And we gonna have to defend it.
LOUISE
...What if we didn’t stay?
Augusta stops, turns.
What?

AUGUSTA

LOUISE
What if we went?
(CONTINUED)

87.

MAD
They comin’ fast -So?

LOUISE

MAD
The Union army’s walkin’ right for us we
can’t just walk right back.
LOUISE
A few guns ain’t gonna keep ‘em out.
AUGUSTA
We can hold ‘em. We can keep it safe.
Louise stands, challenging her sister.
LOUISE
Keeping Room’s just walls Augusta. Ain’t
nothin’ safe.
Mad stands too.
MAD
Three women comin’ ‘gainst the Union army
don’t mean nothin’.
Augusta rests her hands on the table, leaning forward.
AUGUSTA
(realizing)
What if it was men instead uh women?
Augusta looks up at Louise and then at Mad.
EXT. FIELD - LATER
The women stand over the fresh graves. Augusta picks up
the SHOVEL, winces at the pain in her shoulder.
Mad takes the shovel from her and plunges the BLADE into
the DIRT.
CUT TO:
INT. FARMHOUSE / SECOND BEDROOM - DUSK
A series of IMAGES:
-- CLOTHING lands in a PILE on the floor.
(CONTINUED)

88.

-- Augusta pulls on a pair of dirty ARMY TROUSERS.
-- Mad buttons up an MAN’S SHIRT.
-- Louse tucks her hair into a UNION CAP.
Augusta buttons up the last buttons of the jacket and
feels something against her breast. Her hand goes to
it... and she remembers the PHOTOGRAPH.
She pulls it out. We don’t see it, but she looks at it
once more, and then tucks it safely back into his pocket.
And then the FULL PICTURE:
Augusta, Louise and Mad stand in front of the tall mirror
in full UNION UNIFORM. They look at themselves, all
dressed up as men. As soldiers. The uniforms are too big,
of course, but the women wear them well.
Throughout this scene, the SOUNDS OF WAR grow louder.
The sound of GUNS and CANNONS ever closer.
They look at themselves in the mirror.
They aren’t women anymore.
INT. FARMHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
Augusta stands JUST OUTSIDE the open doorway.
She holds one of the OIL LAMPS, considering for a
moment...
AND THEN -She THROWS it right through the door.
It BREAKS, and the floor immediately catches FIRE.
EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT
The land GRUMBLES in the distance, but here, for the
moment, all is still.
Mad and Louise stand a short distance from the house and
watch as THE FIRE STARTS AND CATCHES in one of the
downstairs windows.
Augusta emerges from the house and joins them.
(CONTINUED)

89.

The three of them watch the fire SPREAD, consuming the
only home they’ve ever known.
Louise looks at Augusta, their eyes lock for a moment.
Then Augusta looks at Mad, and their eyes lock too.
And then, they turn and walk. Together. Towards the ROAD.
As they walk, the FIRE continues to GROW behind them,
consuming the ground floor of the house.
Louise turns her head to look once more -AUGUSTA
Don’t look back.
Louise repositions her eyes on the road ahead.
They are feeling the exact same feeling in the exact same
way: they are at once afraid and unafraid.
We go out WIDE as GROUPS of MEN appear from around the
back of the Farmhouse. They are UNION SOLDIERS. Some move
towards the KEEPING ROOM. Others towards the BARN.
But the majority of them fill in around the women,
SWALLOWING them into their fold. And the women walk on,
among them, unrecognized for what they are.
The FIRE GROWS behind them. Turning their world to ASH
and RUBBLE.
The sounds of WAR consume them. Consume us all.
And slowly, slowly, EVER SO SLOWLY, the camera RISES...
UP, UP, UP...
Into the air, above the women, above the road, above the
Farmhouse, the Keeping Room, the Barn and the land.
And settles into the sky.
Their FIRE becomes one of many FIRES.
And there is CRACKLING.
HOLLERING.
BARKING.
GUNSHOTS.
CANONS.
(CONTINUED)

90.

FIRE.
MEN ARE EVERYWHERE.
They creep up over the land like zombies.

THE END.
