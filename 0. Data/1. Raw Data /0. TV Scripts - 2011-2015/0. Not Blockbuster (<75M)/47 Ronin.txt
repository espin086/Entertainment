The 47 Ronin
by
Chris Morgan

DARKNESS...
Then a VOICE rises from the pitch.
NARRATOR (VO)
Feudal Japan. The Age of Shoguns
and Samurai. A time when the
ideals of Loyalty and Honor are
prized above all else by the people
of the Land of the Rising Sun...
(beat)
In Edo, the Emperor has been
reduced to a ceremonial puppet.
All power rests with the Shogun -military warlord Tokugawa
Tsunayoshi -- and is enforced by
his provincial barons -- the
Daimyo. The peace of the realm is
kept by the swords of their loyal
retainers, the samurai -- warriors
of incomparable skill and honor,
who live their lives by the strict
code of ethics known as bushido -the “Way of the Warrior”. To these
loyal knights, their duty to their
lord comes above all else...even
their own lives.
(beat)
A samurai who should ever lose or
fail his master, suffers the
greatest shame in all Japanese
society. They become ronin.
Masterless drifters. Men without
honor. To be ronin is to be
banished from every city, to be
despised by Japanese society, to
know humiliation without end.
(beat)
And yet...to know the story of the
47 Ronin...is to know the story of
all Japan.
SUPER:
The following is based on a true story...
NOW OPEN ON:
EXT. THE PROVINCE OF AKO - DAY - ESTABLISHING
The small and peaceful “jewel” of western Honshu...
Jade-green hillocks terraced with rice paddies. Stands of
ruby-red cherry blossom trees overlooking a sapphire slash of
river. And crowning it all stands the magnificent AKO CASTLE
-- a six-tiered architectural poem written in wood and stone.

2.
We can’t help but to sense the harmony of this place.
SUPER:
Ako Castle.
Western Honshu, 1701 A.D.
Suddenly a PRIMAL YELL shatters the scene.
READY!
SFX:

OISHI

(VO)

The DEADLY RASP of ONE HUNDRED SWORDS drawn in unison.
KESA!

OISHI (VO) (CONT'D)

Instantly -- SCHUNK-SHUNKK-SCHUNKK! The sound of a hundred
swords CUTTING through a hundred bodies. A great percussion
of limbs thumping to the ground, which TAKES US TO:
A FOREST OF EMERALD-GREEN BAMBOO TREES
Each five inches thick and tough as iron.
see ten feet into the forest when --

So many, we can’t

OISHI (OS)
NORTH FRONT! READY!
SFX:

A company of men turning in unison.
OISHI (OS)
MISU-GAESHI!

On command, a hundred razor-sharp KATANAS flash diagonally up
through frame, SHEARING through the bamboo as easily as a
knife slices tofu. But before the trees can fall, the swords
slice back, lightning fast -- SHWOPP! -- cleaving them a
second time horizontally!
The pieces of bamboo tumble away...REVEALING an ARMY OF
SAMURAI WARRIORS. Behind them, shouting the orders, is their
commander, and chief samurai of the Asano Clan, OISHI
KURANOSUKE.
Oishi is in his mid-forties. A proud, stubborn throwback to
the great warriors of times past.
OISHI
EAST FRONT! READY!
As the hundred warriors pivot with machine precision, PULL
BACK TO REVEAL that we are not in a forest at all, but
actually a CASTLE COURTYARD.

3.
What we thought to be a bamboo jungle, our new angle now
reveals are simply a multitude of TARGETS; Oishi is drilling
them at tameshigiri -- test-cutting with their swords.
Oishi calls out another strike. Swords flash, bamboo falls.
And as the music RISES, we CUT TO:
INT. AKO CASTLE - 6TH FLOOR - WOMEN’S APARTMENTS
A beautiful young woman, MIKA (19), stands at the window
watching the soldiers practice below, her gaze falling on one
in particular.
Everything about MINORU (late-20’s) is different. Of halfEuropean/half-Japanese descent, he is relegated to a lower
caste and practices away from the others. While the others
wear samurai armor, Minoru practices in peasant pants and
without a shirt, revealing a sheen of washboard muscle. And
rather than a steel sword, he practices with a bokken -- a
wooden blade -- and thin air as his target.
But despite his lower status -- perhaps even because of it -Minoru has dedicated himself more seriously to the sword than
any around him. His moves have a fluidity and speed
unequalled by anyone else we’ve seen.
Suddenly, the ricepaper door behind Mika slides open and she
jumps with a start. The young daimyo of Ako castle, LORD
ASANO (36), enters the room.
Mika-chan.
Father.

LORD ASANO
MIKA

LORD ASANO
I thought you would be practicing
your dance.
MIKA
I was, I just got caught up in
the...
(awkward beat)
...the beauty of the day.
Asano puts his hands on his daughter’s shoulders.
LORD ASANO
This is important, Mika-chan. Of
all the provinces we have been
honored to host the Shogun and must
make every effort -(glances out the window at
the warriors practicing)
-- despite the view.

4.
MIKA
(blushes)
Of course, father.
He kisses her forehead and, as he moves off, is rewarded to
the first few footsteps and flutters of her FAN as she begins
to practice the dance of The Shrine Maiden’s Ghost.
INT. AKO CASTLE - VARIOUS
TRACK with Asano as he descends through the castle. With a
visit from the Shogun imminent, the place is a beehive of
activity: paper lanterns being hung, flowers being arranged
in dramatic displays, children practicing the farmer’s folk
song “Teru-Teru-Bozu”.
Asano offers a kind word or a gentle command to almost
everyone he passes.
LORD ASANO
(to a lantern hanger)
Beautiful, Yasu.
(to a child singing)
Excellent. Very good.
The child beams with pride. As Asano passes through the
kitchen, we overhear the MASTER CHEF speaking to his
APPRENTICE in the b.g.
MASTER CHEF
...finish cleaning the pheasants,
then make sure that all the knives
are locked away well before the
Shogun arrives.
APPRENTICE
Of course, Master, but why..?
MASTER CHEF
Shogunate law. To draw an edged
blade while the Shogun is in
residence, even a chef’s knife,
carries a mandatory sentence of
death.
The Apprentice blanches.
kitchen staff.

Then turns and shouts at the

APPRENTICE
All blades away now! NOW, I SAID!!
Asano moves on, a smile wrinkling the corner of his mouth.
It’s clear that Ako castle is Camelot at its height -- the
people of the province living happy, contented lives -- and
Asano is its Arthur; noble, just and kind.

5.
EXT. AKO CASTLE - COURTYARD - MOMENTS LATER
The young lord enters the training grounds. Oishi and his
samurai instantly sheathe their weapons and bow.
My Lord.

OISHI

Asano calls out to Minoru.
LORD ASANO
Bring my horse. And another for
the swordmaster.
Minoru takes off for the stables like a shot.
turns to the massed samurai.

Asano then

LORD ASANO
Training is finished for the day.
I need your captain. You men are
dismissed.
As the men move off to their posts, Minoru arrives with the
horses. As the two men mount up, Minoru speaks to Oishi.
MINORU
Do you need someone to accompany
you?
Oishi looks down at Minoru.

It pains him to say this:

OISHI
You know it wouldn’t be
appropriate.
Minoru bows his head.
MINORU
Of course not. Thank you for
considering.
Oishi wants to say more, perhaps a word of comfort, but Lord
Asano turns his mount and begins to ride off.
LORD ASANO
Come, Oishi.
And Oishi must follow his young master.
The moment they’re gone, Minoru’s icy control melts. He
grabs up a sword and, with a roar of rage, attacks the
tameshigiri targets with a STUNNING MARTIAL DISPLAY.
A blur of movement, he cuts a swath through the field of
targets CHOPPING and SLICING, severing DOZENS of lengths of
bamboo -- then cutting them each into TWO, THREE, FOUR
smaller pieces before they can hit the ground.

6.
It’s a lethal DANCE OF DEATH that grows FASTER AND FASTER
until he wheels around to give the target behind him a FINAL
DECAPITATING CHOP --- and finds MIKA standing right there.
Minoru’s blade whirls into his sheath faster she can blink.
Bows his head and AVERTS his eyes from the Lord’s daughter.
For an awkward moment, the two stand there, hidden from
everyone else’s view in the heart of the bamboo field. Then
Mika reaches out and gently lifts his chin with a finger,
intentionally raising Minoru’s eyes to look into her own.
The act is more intimate than a kiss.
After a moment, Minoru remembers his place and pulls away.
MINORU
We cannot -MIKA
What we “cannot” do is deny our
feelings.
MINORU
Mika...
(serious)
It can never be.
MIKA
Silly, boy. Do you care for life
so much to cease living it?
(she caresses his face)
Deny me if you can, my sweet
Minoru, but I warn you, you’ll find
my love a stronger opponent than
your doubt.
She smiles and begins to kiss him.
And before long, it is he who is kissing her.
With all his heart.
EXT. AKO CASTLE - BEYOND THE MAIN GATE - SAME TIME
Asano and Oishi ride along the road leading away from the
castle.
OISHI
Where are we going?

7.
LORD ASANO
I wanted to personally verify that
the roads are presentable for the
arrival of the Shogun.
Oishi waits a beat, then -OISHI
So where are we really going?
Asano smiles.
EXT. AKO COUNTRYSIDE - DAY
A land of mythic beauty...
Asano hops about and shouts excitedly as he tries to land a
fish on the grassy banks of the Seto inland sea.
LORD ASANO
Come, my beauty! Don’t tease!
And with a whoop he lands the fish -- a nice-looking RED SEA
BREAM. Its scales glimmer with ruby iridescence in the sun.
LORD ASANO
Will you not look at this Goddess!
Asano whispers a few words of praise to the wriggling fish,
then releases it back into the water.
OISHI
Will you never keep one of those?
You go to such effort to catch
them.
LORD ASANO
I know I caught it. It knows I
caught it. That’s enough for me.
OISHI
Is this what happens when you get
promoted from warrior to statesman?
You become sentimental about the
lives of fish?
LORD ASANO
I prefer to think of it as
enlightened.
OISHI
It is foolishness.
Asano mock arches an eyebrow at the older swordsman.
Oishi is serious.

But

8.
OISHI
And it’s dangerous.
(beat)
Sentiment is a deception, Takumi.
An imbalance in the Way of things.
It’s choosing to look at life as
how you’d wish it, rather than how
it truly is.
LORD ASANO
(smiles)
And you get all this from releasing
a fish?
OISHI
(frustrated)
All life is about balance. About
order. I’m certain the fish would
rather not be caught, but even it
knows its duty is to give its life
for its lord.
(beat)
In a fight, it is a matter of death
to lose one’s balance. Political
life is no different.
Fine.

LORD ASANO
Next time I’ll eat the fish.

OISHI
It’s not about the damned fish!
The Shogun arrives in a matter of
days and here we are, dipping our
toes in the lake.
LORD ASANO
The castle is prepared.
OISHI
Yes, but are you?
(beat)
They call this visit a celebration,
but it is an inspection, Takumi.
Don’t delude yourself. I believe
Lord Kira selected your province to
try and convince the Shogun that
your lands aren’t being used
wisely. Do not underestimate him.
He has the Shogun’s ear and an
ambition not to be trifled with.
The lands of the last two daimyo to
have displeased the Shogun have
gone to Lord Kira.
LORD ASANO
Lord Kira may have his ear, but
like us, the Shogun is a samurai of
the old ways.
(MORE)

9.
LORD ASANO (CONT'D)
(picks up his fishing
pole)
Now, if you’ll excuse me...
Oishi throws up his hands.
OISHI
I give up. Talking to you is like
talking to a geisha.
A twinkle of mirth glitters in Asano’s eye.

He rises.

LORD ASANO
Is that what you do with geisha?
No wonder you’re so frustrated -But as they turn, they are surprised to find a band of
BRIGANDS atop the bank. A half-dozen murderous sellswords,
armed to the teeth: swords, yari spears, even a heavy
wheellock arquebus.
BRIGAND LEADER
We’ll take the horses.
It is impossible to tell when Oishi’s sword is drawn, it
happens so fast. But Asano places a calming hand on his
shoulder.
No.

LORD ASANO

Oishi looks the brigands over, disgusted.
Ronin.

OISHI

He practically spits the word.
LORD ASANO
Come now. Just because they are
masterless samurai, doesn’t mean
they are honorless samurai.
He turns back to the grim-faced thugs.
LORD ASANO
Do you know who I am?
BRIGAND LEADER
Someone who’s going to see what his
guts look like dancing on the
ground if you don’t hand over the
horses.
LORD ASANO
You’re very insulting.

10.
BRIGAND LEADER
And you’re very stupid.
LORD ASANO
I didn’t mean to me.
(points to Oishi)
You’re insulting him. Talking so
brashly and thinking only a halfdozen men is enough to protect you.
(tsk, tsk)
Very arrogant.
Kill him.

BRIGAND LEADER

Asano shrugs and turns to Oishi as the thugs close in.
LORD ASANO
Diplomacy fails.
OISHI
In this instance, I can’t say I’m
too sorry.
LORD ASANO
Leave one alive for questioning.
If I must.

OISHI

And as the ronin close in, intent on killing the young lord,
Oishi takes a moment to look around. It seems as though he’s
taking in his final seconds of life. But really he’s -OISHI’S POV
-- formulating a plan. He sees them coming and MENTALLY
DISSECTS THE SCENE. From a WIDE ANGLE, we RACK IN on
particular geographic features: the POSITION OF THE SUN, a
TANGLE OF ROOTS. Then on the WEAPONS EACH MAN CARRIES,
noting each in VFX of its effective lethal range.
And in the blink of an eye, Oishi’s got his plan.
THE BATTLE
Oishi wades in. In the BRIGANDS’ POV, it’s lightning fast.
In OISHI’S, it’s all in SLOW MOTION.
As the first attacker (BRIGAND #1) charges in with a spear,
Oishi moves sideways, putting his back to the sun.
POV SPEARMAN: With the sun shining in his eyes, Oishi
appears in SILHOUETTE.

11.
On reflex, the attacker uses Oishi’s shadow to BLOCK the
bright sun -- which is exactly what Oishi counted on. With
explosive speed, Oishi CRABS LEFT, momentarily BLINDING the
spearman and STEPPING IN with a DIAGONAL UPWARD STRIKE.
Like the tameshigiri targets he was training his men on,
Brigand #1 is CUT COMPLETELY IN TWO on a diagonal bias.
Without a pause, Oishi snatches the falling man’s spear and
RAMS it into Brigand #2’s eye, killing him instantly.
BRIGANDS 3, 4 and 5 charge into the gap, but in a surgical
display of skill and ferocity, Oishi performs a happo giri
(”the cut of eight directions”) CLEAVING them clean through
the torso, then further BISECTING their upper-half from skull
to waist.
Like so much bamboo, the bodies FALL APART IN THREE PIECES.
It’s like nothing we’ve ever seen before.
Now Oishi charges on the survivors. The tide of battle turns
and the brigands quick-step back...right into the TANGLE OF
ROOTS. They TRIP and go down hard.
Brigand #6 raises his musket to get off a shot, but Oishi
strikes. SEVERS the arquebus’ barrel -- but his sword
SHATTERS to half its length in the process.
No matter. Even with jagged stub of blade left, Oishi is the
deadliest thing out there. He JABS his ragged blade into the
musketeer’s throat, then WHEELS on a stunned axeman and
performs “The Hourglass” -- a four-stroke zig-zagging cut
that ends with the man’s body EXPLODING APART IN SIX PIECES!
Now only the Brigand Leader is left, laying on the ground,
screaming in panic.
Oishi flicks blood off his shattered blade and approaches.
OISHI
They’ve forgotten how to make a
decent blade.
BRIGAND LEADER
(hysterical)
..h..he said to keep one alive...
But Oishi’s blade lashes out and CUTS OFF the Brigand
Leader’s sword arm.
OISHI
Unfortunate for you.
Suddenly Asano CRIES OUT from behind.
Oishi whips around in panic, gore-covered sword ready to
strike --!!

12.
Only to find Asano capering around at the water’s edge again,
bamboo fishing rod bowed, another fish on the line.
LORD ASANO
Come now, my beauty! My little
Empress of the Waves!
Oishi shakes his head.
its sheath, we --

And as he jams his broken katana into
SMASH CUT TO:

THE BEAUTIFUL SEA BREAM
On a cutting board.

Then -- CHOP!

As the fish’s head is slid aside and a knife begins delicate
work, WIDEN TO REVEAL we are:
INT. OISHI’S HOME - KITCHEN - SUNSET
A humble dwelling, as opposed to the majesty of Ako castle.
Clean. Simple. Comfortable.
Oishi’s wife, HISAE (early 40’s) stands at the board; a
natural beauty with a smile that belies a deep innerstrength. The kind of woman every man wants to marry.
Humming a folksong, her fingers nimbly turn the fish into
sashimi while she stares out the window at her husband and
their 16-year-old son, CHIKARA, sparring with wooden swords
in the yard.
She smiles contentedly.
EXT. OISHI’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
The swords CLACK with the rhythm of war until Oishi senses an
opening and slaps Chikara on the leg with his bokken.
OISHI
You switched to a left-handed
stance. Try again.
But time and again, Chikara falls back into defending with
his left and gets struck by his father’s sword. Hard. Blows
meant to be remembered and learned from.
Tears of frustration rise in the boy’s eyes. Oishi sees this
and changes tacks. Removes his obi from his kimono.
Here.

OISHI
Let’s try this...

13.
Oishi begins to tie his son’s left hand down to his side.
CHIKARA
I don’t understand.

Why all this?

OISHI
Because every time you’re hit with
strength, you switch to your left
hand, and when you do that, you
leave your flank exposed to right
handed samurai -Oishi cinches the knot down hard to emphasize the point.
OISHI
-- which is everyone.
(ruffles his son’s hair)
It’s for your own good.
The two go back to practicing until Hisae comes outside.
HISAE
Enough practice, Oishi. You’ve
been out here for hours. He’s a
growing boy. He needs to eat as
much as he needs to practice.
Oishi relents with a smile.
All right.

OISHI
Practice is over.

He unties Chikara’s left hand.
OISHI
(grins)
...but you will be eating with your
right.
As they move to walk inside, a RIDER comes galloping down the
footpath at full-speed. Stops only inches from Oishi.
Oishi’s second-in-command -- and best friend -- HANJO (late
50’s) dismounts the panting beast.
OISHI
You’re going to kill that horse,
Hanjo.
HANJO
An envoy from the Shogun has
arrived at the castle.
Oishi stops dead.
So early?

OISHI

14.
HANJO
Lord Asano requests your presence
to receive him.
Like a flipped switch, Oishi goes into command mode.
OISHI
Gather the men. Have them ready
for presentation in an hour.
Chikara looks up at his father, hopefully.
No.

OISHI
You stay with your mother.

It’s kindly said, and stings all the more for it.
And with that, Oishi mounts up.
to her despondent son.

As he rides off, Hisae turns

HISAE
He’s hard on you because he loves
you.
But Chikara shakes his head.
CHIKARA
He loves me...but I’ll never be
good enough in his eyes.
And Chikara walks off, leaving Hisae alone on the path,
staring after the two men in her life departing in very
separate directions...
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. AKO CASTLE - DAIMYO’S SHOIN - 7TH FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER
The private room where the castle Lord receives audience...
The paper walls and tatami mats are spotless. In fact, the
only bits of color come from the black and gray kimonos of
Lord Asano and Oishi, who kneel at the rear of the room.
Just then, the shoji doors slide open and LORD KIRA enters -an explosion of pomposity and sumptuous silk. Rather than
the plain formal robes that Asano and Oishi wear, Lord Kira
floats along in the most GAUDILY ORNATE ROBE we’ve ever seen.
A dozen ATTENDANTS follow behind, wrangling Kira’s arm and
leg sleeves that trail twenty feet behind.
After countless precise steps, Lord Kira and his entourage
stop and a COURTIER steps forward.

15.
COURTIER
The exalted Shogunate’s Master of
Protocol and most-honorable Lord of
the Ryogoku domain, Lord Kira
Kozukenosuke Yoshinaka.
Asano and Oishi bow.
When Kira speaks, we see his teeth are BLACKENED in the
trendy, effeminate style of court aristocrats.
LORD KIRA
Daimyo Asano Takumi no kami
Naganori... you may look upon me.
LORD ASANO
Fortune truly smiles upon us to
receive so august a member of the
Shogunate.
Asano waits for a return compliment, as is the custom... but
after a moment, it’s clear none will be forthcoming.
LORD ASANO
We were surprised at your early
arrival -Kira cuts him off.
LORD KIRA
You should be grateful for my early
arrival. I went over the
presentations you have planned for
the Shogun. They were riddled with
errors in court protocol. I have
done my best to correct them,
thereby saving you from myriad
humiliations before the Shogun.
Asano again bows his head to the floor.
annoyed with Kira’s attitude.

Oishi is clearly

LORD ASANO
Thank you, Lord Kira. In return,
the people of Ako and I wish to
offer you this token of
appreciation.
Asano claps two summoning sticks together and two retainers
enter the room bearing a lacquered CHEST. Kira waves
impatiently, and the chest is opened -- revealing a BOUNTY OF
GOLD COINS.
But Kira stares at the glittering fortune, unimpressed.

16.
LORD KIRA
Token...
(beat)
A token gift indeed.
Asano and Oishi are struck by the comment.
care.

Kira doesn’t

LORD KIRA
A true gift is what has been
bestowed upon you, Lord Asano.
Wasted, in truth.
Kira glances out the window at the countryside.
LORD KIRA
Only twenty percent of the land in
the entire country is capable of
producing crops. And yet here you
sit with your cherry blossom trees
and your grassy hills.
(beat)
A man could raise an army to dwarf
all others with fertile soil such
as this. An ambitious man.
Kira takes a handful of gold coins. Lets them slip
disdainfully through his fingers, unwanted as pennies.
Pity.

LORD KIRA

And in a flurry of silk and arrogance, Kira exits the room.
When he’s gone, Oishi rises, knuckles white on his sword.
OISHI
I’d like to strike that smug head
from his shoulders.
But the young lord puts a calming hand on Oishi’s shoulder.
LORD ASANO
The world is changing, my friend.
Courtiers like Kira are the new
samurai. Guns are replacing
swords. And the swords that remain
are mostly ornamental.
(indicates)
Like yours. There was a time when
it would’ve been unthinkable for
your blade to shatter against the
inferior ones of those ronin at the
sea. But that was when the art of
true swordmaking was still valued.
Still cared for.
(beat)
(MORE)

17.
LORD ASANO (CONT'D)
Now the legendary koto blades are
long since forgotten. Now outward
expression takes precedence over
inner core.
Asano turns to the window and stares at the same countryside
Kira did moments before.
LORD ASANO
It is not Kira that is the problem
in this age...but us.
Then, almost to himself -LORD ASANO
Because we remember.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. AKO CASTLE - STOREHOUSE - NIGHT
Safely ensconced among barrels of sake and bolts of silk,
Mika and Minoru hold each other in the moonlight.
Gently, Mika traces his eyebrows with the tip of her finger.
MIKA
I like the shape of your eyes.
But he lowers his face, ashamed.
MINORU
They set me apart.
MIKA
Yes, but in a good way.
(beat)
I look at your eyes and I see that
your father loved your mother.
Your face tells their story.
Clearly, and to the world.
Unashamed.
(looks him in the eye)
As someday I hope our children’s
will tell ours.
And as she smiles at him -SFX:

A LOW RUMBLING BEGINS

Barely audible at first, but GROWING. Soon, loose grains of
rice on the ground begin to VIBRATE and DANCE.
Minoru is the first to notice.

Stops, listening.

18.
MIKA
What is it?
Minoru doesn’t answer, but races to an arrowslit.
POV MINORU: The darkened hillside. Then the low clouds
begin to GLOW ORANGE from beneath as eight thousand torches
CREST THE RISE!
The Shogun’s ARMY has arrived.
BACK TO SHOT: As Mika watches, Minoru races for the
storehouse door -- then catches himself. Stops. Races back.
Kisses her.
And races out to find Oishi.
EXT. AKO CASTLE - MAIN GATE -

NIGHT

The mist-shrouded castle looks like something out of myth -a pagoda of the gods alight with the glow of ten thousand
paper lanterns.
Asano and his Honor Guard, headed by Oishi, stand within the
castle’s enormous main gate as the Shogun’s company arrives.
Bearing the HERALDIC CHARGE OF THE TOKUGAWA CLAN, the great
sea of warriors passes through the ancient gate. MYTHICLOOKING SAMURAI UNITS from the fifty provinces, each with its
own distinctive STANDARD or DEVICE:
-- Kyoto’s CRIMSON DEVIL SQUAD in their lacquered, BLOOD-RED
ARMOR...
-- The IRON BOARS of Hizen, with two-foot-long sharpened iron
TUSKS on their great helms...
-- The Izumi TIGERS in their enameled TIGER-STRIPE PLATE
ARMOR, bristling with STEEL CLAWS...
And more. Edo’s PHOENIX REGIMENT. Shima’s SCORPIONS.
Osaka’s WHITE CRANES. Five thousand mythic shapes filling
the courtyard like warriors from some dark god’s fever dream.
Suddenly, all at once, they STOP.
There’s a charged moment.

Asano and Oishi exchange a glance.

Then, as if by telepathy, the armies SEPARATE, clearing a
path for a SHADOWY FIGURE to walk forward.
From a spiked chain wrapped about his fist, the Figure leads
four monstrous DOGS OF WAR. Snarling, snapping, they are
each as large as a bullock; muscles rippling, ready to kill.

19.
But they’re nothing compared to the man on the other end of
the chain:
SHOGUN TOKUGAWA TSUNAYOSHI (54)
is easily the most intimidating figure we’ve ever seen. Born
in the Year of the Dog, his fearsome kabuto helm is rendered
in the shape of a great snarling DOG OF WAR.
Six feet of heavy, scarred-covered muscle, the Shogun is the
survivor of a hundred grim battles and has been hard-tempered
into the very image of control. Of Law.
As his dogs growl menacingly, the Shogun stalks up Asano and
stands there, weighing the young daimyo with his gaze.
It’s an uncomfortable moment.

But Asano bows regally.

LORD ASANO
Shogun Tokugawa Tsunayoshi, the
people of Ako bid you welcome.
The fierce Shogun pins Asano with his gaze.
Then nods.
COURT ANNOUNCER (VO)
The rules of the melee are simple.
If a warrior is struck, he is out.
HARD CUT TO:
EXT. AKO’S OUTDOOR COMBAT ARENA - DAY
The stands are full of various LORDS AND RETAINERS from the
Shogun’s entourage. In the crowd, FIND Lord Asano. Oishi
and his daughter sit to either side of him.
COURT ANNOUNCER
The last warrior standing wins the
exhibition in the name of their
clan, and a boon from the Shogun.
The Announcer nods to the Shogun who sits like a grim statue.
Suddenly, an oily voice speaks behind Asano.
LORD KIRA (OS)
I did not know your concubine was
so lovely, Lord Asano.
Asano turns to see the effete Kira staring at Mika.
LORD ASANO
She is my daughter.

20.
LORD KIRA
All the better.
(bows before Mika)
Your father forgets his manners.
am Kira Kozukenosuke.

I

MIKA
Asano Mika.
Kira’s eyes crawl over her bowed form.
LORD KIRA
We will become better acquainted,
you and I, Lady Asano.
Kira maintains his gaze. It feels like hands roaming over
her skin. Mika quickly becomes uncomfortable and just as
Asano rises to intervene -The Master of Protocol moves on to take his seat beside the
Shogun.
EXT. COMBAT ARENA - READY AREA - CONTINUOUS
Over fifty SAMURAI COMBATANTS are lined up to enter the ring,
each wearing the DISTINCTIVE ARMOR and CRESTS of their clans.
One by one, they enter as the Announcer calls their province.
TOWARD THE REAR OF THE LINE, Hanjo paces worriedly.
HANJO
Where in the Eighteen Hells is
Taro? Minoru, check his house!
Minoru sprints off to -EXT. TARO’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
Thatch roof and earthen walls.

Minoru bursts --

her nakedness. TARO keeps on sleeping.

Minoru turns and grabs up the heavy cuirass bearing the CREST
of House Asano -- two falcon feathers crossed over one
another -- but when he turns back, Taro is passed out again.

The combat floor has filled with the samurai combatants.

Taro!
But no one enters the arena. There’s a horribly awkward
pause. Asano and Oishi share a look.
IN THE READY AREA
Hanjo is sweating it... until Taro races up in his armor.
HANJO
Oh thank the gods!
Get in there!!

Get in there!

But as he runs past, we get a glimpse under his kabuto helm
and see that it’s not Taro at all, but -MINORU
He enters the arena and takes his place among the sea of
samurai. So much MYTHOLOGICALLY-INSPIRED ARMOR, the
battlefield looks like someone has sprung the gates of hell.
Beneath his disguise, Minoru’s heart is racing, his breath
coming too fast, skin sheened in sweat.
And in that moment, he CLOSES HIS EYES and takes a breath.
Holds it until his mind is calmed...
Begin!

COURT ANNOUNCER

And when his eyes FLASH OPEN, there’s steel in them, all fear
evaporated.
And the contest starts.
The combat floor ERUPTS in a motion. Bokken flashing faster
than the eye can follow. The SOUND of wood striking metal.
Leather. Flesh.

22.
Minoru SWEEPS under the guard of a fighter with a MONSTROUS
LEVIATHAN FISH HELM, and STRIKES his abdomen. In an instant,
the man is out -- and so are half the other combatants.
But there’s no time to rest as a Noto HARE springs forward
and attacks with the jackrabbit speed his clan is known for.
Minoru loses his footing and TRIPS, making an easy target for
the Hare. He’s a sitting duck -But when he catches sight of Mika in the stands, he refuses
to go down like this. As the Hare leaps to deliver the
eliminating blow, Minoru WHIRLS OUT OF THE WAY and RIPOSTES
with a clean shot to the man’s legs. The Rabbit cries out as
he crumples to the ground.
Other fighters close in -But Minoru’s switch has been flipped. He picks up another
sword off the ground and DUAL-WIELDS -- one in each hand.
POV MINORU - as the field of battle swirls around him,
impossibly slow. As an IRON BOAR charges, Minoru easily
redirects with one sword and STRIKES the man’s helm with the
other, SNAPPING OFF AN IRON TUSK and sending him SPRAWLING
into the dirt.
BACK TO SHOT - as Minoru wades through the fray like a
killing machine, an ambidextrous engine of death, eliminating
fighter after fighter after fighter.
IN THE STANDS - a corpulent daimyo turns to Asano.
CORPULENT DAIMYO
Your man is good.
Asano nods, but beside him, Oishi is beginning to suspect.
OISHI
(under his breath)
Not that good.
With Minoru coming on like a cyclone of swordwork, the
surviving samurai start joining forces to take him out.
It does no good.
THE SHOGUN watches the display -- Minoru taking on two
fighters simultaneously. Then three. The Shogun is
impressed. Kira grimaces, wishing the fighter was anyone but
Asano’s.
OVERHEAD SHOT - the contest has separated into two distinct
maelstroms of battle across the arena from each other,
swirling in opposite directions.

23.
IN MINORU’S FRAY - Every remaining fighter joins forces
against Minoru, six samurai against one. The rapid-fire
CLACKING OF BLADES sounds like dominoes in a blender.
And just when we think it can get no faster, Minoru takes it
up a level, INCREASING THE TEMPO and turning the attackers
into defenders.
Minoru establishes a RHYTHM to his double attacks, and once
the defenders settle into it -- he BREAKS it, exploding in an
UNHOLY ONSLAUGHT that takes them all out.
OVERHEAD SHOT - In the end, both battles resolve
simultaneously, leaving only two fighters standing. Minoru
on one end of the arena...and a warrior from nightmare on the
other.
Minoru’s opponent is a muscular giant, a foot taller than he
and clad in battle gear ripped from H.P. Lovecraft’s most
horrific delirium. His armor is composed of lacquered black
SCALES; his helm wrought into the shape of a DEMON OCTOPUS
wrapped around his head, eight long STEEL TENTACLES dangling
down his back.
MIKA
turns worriedly to Asano.
MIKA
Father, who is that?
But before Asano can answer, Kira leans in.
LORD KIRA
The victor from last year, my dear.
(smugly)
My fighter...
The audience is holding its breath. And at a nod from Kira,
his fighter marches on Minoru. Minoru waits for the
sonofabitch to get in range, then BLAZES INTO A WHIRLWIND
ATTACK WITH BOTH SWORDS!
But the Lovecraftian Samurai counters every single strike
easily and continues marching on Minoru, relentless as a
golem.
Recovering, Minoru executes a tricky three-way cut, but the
Knight WHIPS his head around and LASHES Minoru’s leg with his
steel tentacles, YANKING him from his feet.
In a heartbeat, the knight rushes forward and unleashes a
blow at full-strength at Minoru’s head. Minoru blocks with
both bokken -And both of his swords explode into a thousand splinters!

24.
The audience gasps. Only the handles of his obliterated
swords remain in Minoru’s hands. Realizing his defeat, he
rises and bows to the knight.
But the Octopus turns to Kira, who nods -And the bastard STRIKES MINORU IN THE FACE with all his
might. WHAM! Minoru flies ten feet and crashes, sprawling,
into the ground. Again the audience GASPS and the entire
world STOPS...
But this time it’s because the helmet that has hidden
Minoru’s identity...lays twenty feet away in the dirt.
IN THE STANDS - Mika GASPS.

Asano GAPES.

Oishi lowers his

LORD KIRA uses the thunder of the moment, pointing at Minoru.
LORD KIRA
This is an outrage!
(looks to Asano)
Who is responsible for this?!
Asano begins to rise -- but Minoru prostrates himself before
the great warlord.
MINORU
This was my vanity. Lord Asano
knew nothing of this.
LORD KIRA
How dare you wear the armor of a
samurai! You’re a halfbreed!
MINORU
I cannot deny it.
(turns to the Shogun)
But my father was an honored
samurai. He fought alongside you
at Sekigahara, Lord Shogun. I only
wanted to display my skills before
you to honor his memory.
Mika’s heart skips a beat as Minoru stands at the center of
the ring. The Shogun’s stony eyes consider him. Then -SHOGUN
You have demonstrated great
ability...
Minoru’s eyes fill with pride.
SHOGUN
...but no matter what you
accomplish, a halfbreed will never
be worthy of being a samurai.

25.
And the dream shatters.
SHOGUN
(to his men)
Strip him of his armor and have it
burned. It is tainted.
Instantly, the Shogun’s elite guard come forward and start
VIOLENTLY RIPPING the armor off his body. It’s brutal to
watch, a public beating, and Minoru offers no resistance.
The sheer intensity of the humiliation forces Mika to look
away.
When they are done, Minoru, bloodied, bows low before the
Shogun.
MINORU
Forgive my arrogance.
SHOGUN
You are dismissed.
And as Minoru makes the long walk of shame out of the arena,
Asano turns to his daughter -- and is surprised to find her
eyes filled with TEARS. Almost as if she was WEEPING.
He watches her, genuinely confused by her emotion...until
REALIZATION hits. Asano’s jaw drops as it all clicks
together in his head. He looks again at Minoru; at his
daughter...
And realizes that they are lovers.
As Asano sits back, stunned, mind reeling -- RACK FOCUS
across the stands to Lord Kira, who has been watching the
whole exchange.
And he has realized it, too.
SLOW DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. AKO CASTLE - HOURS LATER
The Shogun’s armies have bivouacked in the greensward around
the castle -- a city of tents billowing in the breeze, each
flying the PENNON and CREST of the unit housed within.
INT. AKO CASTLE - BANQUET HALL - NIGHT
A feast has died down and people are retiring for the night.
The Shogun rises to leave, sending a courtier to Asano’s
table.

COURTIER
The Shogun will now retire for the
evening.
Of course.

LORD ASANO

Asano turns to the Shogun across the room and bows low.
Shogun’s face is an emotionless mask as he moves off.

The

When the Shogun is gone, Asano’s calm veneer cracks and his
eyes begin to search the room for something. Oishi clocks
it.
OISHI
You are troubled. I take full
responsibility for Minoru’s actions
today -LORD ASANO
It’s not that.
What then?

OISHI

LORD ASANO
I have to speak to my daughter.
It’s urgent.
TRACK WITH Asano as he moves off through the castle.
As he nears the women’s chambers, Asano HEARS Mika’s voice
WHISPERING around a corner. Small sounds of passion.
Asano’s face hardens and he rounds the corner to find Mika in
the embrace of:
MINORU!

LORD ASANO

But as the man turns, it’s not Minoru at all -- rather LORD
KIRA. And the sounds Mika was making were not passion, but
STRUGGLE.
Seeing Asano, Mika’s eyes plead for help.
Father!

MIKA

Asano is there in a heartbeat, wrenching Kira away and
HURLING him against the wall.
LORD ASANO
What is the meaning of this?!
But Kira is a tower of fury.

27.
LORD KIRA
HOW DARE YOU LAY YOUR HANDS UPON A
COURTIER OF THE SHOGUN!
MIKA
(hysterical)
Father, he was -LORD KIRA
Hold your tongue if you wish to

LORD ASANO
That is enough!
Kira’s hand moves to his sword.
LORD ASANO
Don’t you dare.
MIKA
He was going to -LORD KIRA
I said SHUT YOUR MOUTH!
And in a blur of motion, Kira DRAWS HIS SWORD at Mika and
Asano SLASHES OUT to parry the blow --- only to find that he’s been tricked.
Kira does not have a sword in his hands...but one of Mika’s
FANS severed in half by Asano’s gleaming blade.
ECU as the slashed half of the fan falls to the floor.
Though it’s light as a feather, the sound of it hitting the
wooden floor is like the toll of Doom’s bell.
BACK TO SHOT as Asano looks up...and sees Kira LEERING.
LORD KIRA

And as the enormity of what Asano’s just done hits home,

samurai -- staring at Asano’s UNSHEATHED BLADE in horror.

Oishi searches for an answer that will stop this
madness...but finds none. Asano meet Oishi’s eyes.

LORD ASANO
You know I cannot. You taught me
too well, old friend. I broke the
law and must pay the price.

resolve returns to his eyes.

INT. AKO CASTLE - CORRIDOR
The men are lead toward where the Shogun waits. In his white
robes, Asano looks like a ghost floating through the hall.

MIKA

Mika comes running and Asano embraces her. The guards
clearly want to continue on, but Asano raises a hand.
LORD ASANO

They grant it.

Mika weeps into her father’s shoulder.

MIKA

This

LORD ASANO
(gently)
What is true...is that you have

As she begins to weep, he kisses her forehead. Then, out of
everyone in the crowded corridor, Asano locks eyes with
Minoru.
LORD ASANO
Care for her.
I wil--

MINORU

But Asano grabs the hafu’s hand and repeats himself...this
time imparting a deeper meaning.
LORD ASANO
Care for her.
Minoru is rocked by the revelation.

He knows about us.

Just then, a massive arm separates them, pushing Minoru and
Mika back. It’s Kira’s best fighter -- the LOVECRAFTIAN
SAMURAI that bested Minoru in the arena.
Move.

LOVECRAFTIAN SAMURAI

His heavy hand grips Asano’s shoulder and forcefully leads
him away. Into the chamber where the young lord will end his
own life.
As he closes the door, Kira’s fighter looks back at
Mika...and grins, enjoying the moment.

31.
The doors close behind him with a crushing finality.
FATHER -!!

MIKA

Mika races forward and yanks at the door, but it is barred.
No!

MIKA

As she pounds at it, Minoru appears beside her.
Mika...

MINORU

He gently takes her hand.
MINORU
Mika-chan...
And the endearment her father has used since the day of her
birth reaches her. She stops struggling.
MINORU
I’ll take you to him.
And as grief overwhelms her...she allows herself to be led
away.
INT. AKO CASTLE - CEREMONIAL CHAMBER
Asano and Oishi enter. The Shogun sits at the far end of the
chamber with a grim-looking contingent of VERIFYING
OFFICIALS, including Kira, who’s clearly enjoying the moment.
A small table sits in the center of the room.

Asano crosses the room with a calmness that belies the event
about to take place here and kneels at the table.
LORD ASANO

I thank you for allowing me to end

hand, rather than the execution as
a criminal as I deserve.
The Shogun nods.
Asano closes his eyes, contemplating for a moment...
And then he takes up the dagger.

The sakura is the most beautiful of

Mika stares at the tiny flower in her hand -- the poetic
representation of the life of her father -- and allows
herself to lose her grief in its beauty.

The strength and assuredness in Oishi’s voice flows into
Asano. With resolve, he again picks up the dagger.

blossom in her hand. With ASANO opening his robes to expose
his abdomen.

33.
With OISHI drawing his sword to stand behind his lord,
preparing cut off the head of his student -- his friend -should the pain become too great.
And as the music reaches CRESCENDO, Asano PLUNGES the dagger
into his belly, CUTTING SIDEWAYS then UP, disemboweling
himself before the Shogun. The seconds stretch out. OISHI
is in turmoil as Asano remains utterly stoic. Glances up to
see KIRA with a slight smile curving his lips -- a memory
that burns itself in his brain forever.
ASANO holds on as long as he can, but as the suffering
overwhelms him and he begins to CRY OUT -- SCHWOP!
OISHI is there to strike down and preserve his dignity.
ASANO’S BODY topples forward, a pool of red blood spreading
across the white floor...
AND AT THAT EXACT MOMENT ON THE HILLTOP,
A breeze stirs the sakura tree and a thousand cherry blossoms
float down through the moonglow to embrace Mika in a rain of
otherworldly beauty...
FADE TO:
INT. AKO CASTLE - ARMORY - LATER
Lord Asano’s entire army of three-hundred-and-fifty samurai
has amassed in the heart of the castle. An argument is going
on. Some are shouting for calm, most are GIRDING THEMSELVES
FOR WAR.
AGING SAMURAI
This is madness! The Shogun issued
a direct mandate: there are to be
no reprisals against Lord Kira!
A hot-tempered samurai, ISOGAI, straps on his sword.
ISOGAI
The Shogun be damned! Bushido says
we avenge our master at all costs!
On the far side of the room, OISHI stands, peering through a
SHOOTING HOLE, lost in thought.
Outside, the Shogunate’s samurai are massing before the
armory, Lord Kira’s men in the vanguard. Oishi’s forces are
desperately outnumbered. It will be a slaughter.
Reverently, Minoru steps up beside Oishi.
ISOGAI
What say you, Blademaster?

The question wakes Oishi from his thoughts.

ISOGAI
(confused)
What..?
And Oishi issues the last order they would ever expect.
OISHI
There will be no more bloodshed
today. Set down your weapons.
As one, the samurai are staggered with disbelief.
OLDER SAMURAI
You mistake us for cowards!
We are not afraid to die!

SAMURAI #2
We must avenge the death of
our Lord!

OISHI
Look outside. You will not

ISOGAI
Success or failure does not matter!
The only thing that is important is
that we uphold Honor by trying!
No.

OISHI

ISOGAI
You craven dog --!
With a shocking display of speed, Oishi reaches out and HURLS
the haughty young samurai to the floor. Oishi has his short
sword out and at the gasping man’s throat in an instant.

35.
OISHI
It matters...because if we fail,
Kira lives and our Lord’s murder
will go unavenged. Put your honor
aside. I have a duty.
(pointedly)
As do you all.
Now Oishi pulls from his robes the dagger with which Asano
took his own life.
OISHI
Because of Kira, our master took
his own life with this blade.
(beat)
I will not rest until Kira does the
same.
As his words sink in, Oishi removes his blade from Isogai’s
throat and stands.
Hanjo, Oishi’s right-hand man, steps up.
HANJO
So what are you saying?
OISHI
A great warrior once told me, “If
the enemy thinks of the mountains,
attack like the sea; and if he
thinks of the sea, attack like the
mountains.”
(beat)
We wait.
Oishi scans the room, meeting each man’s eyes.
OISHI
We wait until this day is but a
memory to them, until they believe
our spirit is broken and the danger
has passed... And when all their
suspicions have been quenched and
their guard has finally dropped, we
will gather as one -In a blink, Oishi turns and buries the sword in a thick
wooden beam -- THUNKK!
OISHI
And then we will strike.
Oishi takes the dagger and draws the blade across his palm,
making a thin slice across his sword hand. Then holds the
blade out to the others.
One by one, they all do the same.

36.
The blood pact is complete.

SMASH TO:

EXT. CASTLE - ARMORY - MOMENTS LATER
We hear a lockbar sliding... Then the great doors swing wide
to reveal OISHI, weaponless. He and his men exit and are
marshalled by a thousand Shogunate soldiers to be stood
before:
THE SHOGUN AND LORD KIRA
Forced to stand beside him, Mika watches with a soulless
stoicism as Lord Kira addresses the surrendered samurai.
LORD KIRA
Drop your weapons, all of you.
The sound of over three hundred swords striking the ground is
the sound of the death of an entire clan.
LORD KIRA (CONT’D)
Now remove your crest.
Oishi’s men look to one another in shock, reluctant to do so.
LORD KIRA (CONT’D)
REMOVE THEM!
As one, they turn to Oishi...but he does not meet their eyes.
Merely nods.
Across the gulf of soldiers, Mika meets Minoru’s eyes...and
cannot endure the shame she sees there. Tries to turn away,
but Kira reaches out and GRASPS her wrist, wrenching her
around so she must watch.
Minoru sees it and instantly reaches for his sword -- but
Oishi restrains him with a firm hand on his shoulder.
Patience.

OISHI

And slowly, Minoru’s muscles unbunch...and he relents.
In utter shame, Oishi’s men drop their formal kimonos bearing
the crossed-feather crest of House Asano into the mud.
LORD KIRA
Your master is dead. House Asano
is no more. You have failed them
both.
(beat)
You are no longer worthy of the
title “samurai”. From this moment
forward, you are ronin.

The word strikes Asano’s men like a slap to the face.
LORD KIRA (CONT’D)
Honorless. Reviled. Cowards.
(venomous)
You are banished from these lands.
Those of you still here by the ring
of the third bell will be hunted
down and executed.
With a nod from their Lord, Kira’s warriors SURGE IN and
begin driving Asano’s disgraced men from the castle grounds.
LORD KIRA (CONT’D)
Except you.

Arrest him.
Kira returns to his place beside the Shogun as a dozen men
knock Oishi brutally to the ground. Oishi offers no

Thinking quickly, she quells the rising horror and rallies.
MIKA

Lord...but as the Master of
Protocol must himself know,
tradition demands a period of
mourning for my father.
LORD KIRA
(riled)
Such is not always the case.
But the Shogun has come to a decision.
SHOGUN
I will allow it. You are granted
one year to mourn. During that
time you will not be touched....
Mika revels in the small victory, until -SHOGUN (CONT’D)

Kira’s, and he the steward of your

But--

SHOGUN
You are dismissed, Lady Asano.
There’s nothing more to be done. Trembling, with defeat
weighing heavily on her small frame, Mika bows to the Shogun,
and we -SLAM TO:
PITCH BLACK
Sounds of a struggle, then -A heavy stone LID is opened twenty feet above us. In the
weak light, we can make out dank stone walls, rats scuttling
in the shadows. This is the “Ako Pit” -- the worst dungeon
in the province.
Up above, four of Kira’s Elite Guard BEAT Oishi within an
inch of his life, then HURL him down into the pit.

39.
WHAM! Oishi’s body crashes to the stony floor and lays
still. Laughing, the guards start sliding the dungeon lid
closed, and as the dark moves in, so do the rats.
The sound of the pit door closing is the sound of despair -BOOOOM!
And the world is swallowed in darkness...
SLOW FADE UP ON:
EXT. AKO CASTLE - MORNING
A bright summer sun is in the sky.

The castle gate opens and Oishi -- gaunt, stooped -- is led
into the blinding sunshine for the first time in a year and
hurled into the mud.
GUARD
On your way, ronin!
Oishi cowers in the muck, confused. He is no longer the
strong, noble warrior we knew, but a broken wretch.
The Guard KICKS him in the ribs.
GUARD
Ronin filth! You make me sick!
Out of my sight!
When the guard goes to kick him again, Oishi scrambles away
like a beaten dog. He’s still grovelling when the Guard
slams the gate in his face.
HIGH ABOVE, from the castle’s seventh floor balcony, Kira
watches Oishi weeping in the road. Deeply satisfied, he
turns to one of his trusted SPIES.
LORD KIRA
(re: Oishi)
Have him watched. If he gives any
sign of rebellion, cut him down.
EXT. AKO VILLAGE - ROAD - DAY
Oishi limps into the village...to find that everything has
CHANGED.
The land has been STRIPPED and the sakura trees have all been
CHOPPED DOWN. The once-beautiful hills and meadows have been
FURROWED into UGLY CROP FIELDS to feed Kira’s legions that
patrol the streets in number.

As Oishi enters the marketplace, people begin to point.

Ronin.
As he passes, villagers turn away, refusing to acknowledge
his now pathetic existence. The murmuring increases, until
someone shoves him from behind, knocking him into the dust.
Oishi turns skittishly to see a group of three VENDORS
looming over him. Men he once knew. Men who respected him.
BURLY VENDOR

Oishi’s son turns on the crowd, wooden bokken in hand, and
the crowd backs a step from his burning gaze.

Oishi’s wife is on her knees out front, digging burdock root
from the tiny garden. Clearly times have been tough.

Chikara lay asleep on the floor, curled near the warmth of
the brazier.
Quietly, Hisae tiptoes in and removes a gently bubbling
kettle from the fire. Carries it across the house to where -OISHI
waits. Hisae settles beside him, dipping two soft cloths in
the warmed water.
All right.

HISAE

Oishi removes his robe...and the visual shock of his INJURIES
steals her breath. Scars, scabs and bruises of every kind
crisscross his back: puncture wounds, lacerations, burn
marks; hard lumps where broken ribs have healed.
Hisae is frozen by the sight of so much pain.
OISHI
(gently)
It’s all right, Hisae. My scars
are nothing compared to what you
must have endured as the wife of a
ronin.
HISAE
That’s all behind us now.
Blinking back tears, she begins to wash her husband’s
tortured body, and we DISSOLVE TO:

Hisae is finishing cleaning his wounds.
HISAE

will happen to her after.

Hisae wrings out her cloth, and Oishi begins to dress.
OISHI
What of my men?
Hisae hesitates, fearing this line of questioning.
HISAE

cut down. Eventually all were
driven off.

I heard Ryoichi now works a farm in
Matsumae. Ayame says he’s happy.
Hisae moves around to look in her husband’s eyes.
HISAE
We could be happy. We have a
second chance, Oishi, we should
take it. We can leave the village
tomorrow and start a new life.
Watch our son become a man. Grow
old together. Is that not all we
need?
Her smile is heartbreaking.

So filled with hope...

Oishi enfolds her in his arms, so she will not see the lie.
Yes...

OISHI

She closes her eyes, burying her face in his chest and
holding him tight, never wanting to let go.
HISAE
Don’t widow me to an ideal, Oishi.
But as we DOLLY AROUND we see the fire in Oishi’s eyes and
realize for the first time that this is not a broken man.
And never was.
INT. BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT
Hisae wakes -- to find Oishi missing from bed. She rises
from the futon and makes her way to the window where she
spies her husband sitting atop a low hill in the pre-dawn
dark.

EXT. OISHI’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
In the quiet dark, Oishi stares up at the stars, conflicted
emotions upon his face.
Then:
HISAE (O.S.)
Some of the men went to find work
with the Dutch at Dejima.
Oishi turns to find his wife standing there, a silk-wrapped
BUNDLE in her hands.
HISAE
You’ll find Hanjo there.
Oishi reaches out and crushes her to his chest.
After a moment she pulls away and hands him the bundle.
Oishi opens it...revealing the DAGGER Lord Asano used to take
his own life.
Oishi starts to say something, but she stops him.
HISAE
I am the wife of a samurai.
Whatever your duties and
obligations, they are mine, too.
Oishi looks at his wife...his incredible wife...and realizes
she accepts what he has to do.
With no words strong enough to carry the emotion, Oishi takes
her in his arms again.
AND FROM THE WINDOW OF HIS ROOM
Chikara watches the silhouettes of his parents against the
moonlight...and knows that his father is leaving.

Mika stands alone at the window, a prisoner in a jail without
bars. She’s staring out at the world below, at freedom, when
Lord Kira enters the room behind her.
He moves close, but when she senses him, she turns and backs
away in fear.
LORD KIRA
(disappointed)
All that you see from this window
could be yours. Why do you resist
me so?
Again, he approaches her slowly, like he would a timid
animal. Reaches out to stroke her face, but the moment his
black-lacquered fingernails touch her face, she SLAPS his
hand away defiantly.
Kira’s shock flashes to anger and he STRIKES her across the
face. And just as he rears back to strike her again -Behind them, the door opens and Kira’s Spy enters.

KIRA’S SPY
Oishi is broken. I’ve watched
peasant farmers spit on him. Kick

an ounce of fight left in him.
LORD KIRA
You sound disappointed.
KIRA’S SPY
It’s just that... The stories I
have heard. He was such a great
warrior. To see him like this...
Kira strides to table in the center of the room holding
several BONSAI TREES.
LORD KIRA
What do you know of bonsai trees?
The Spy is taken aback.

KIRA’S SPY
I know they are beautiful.
LORD KIRA
Yes, but only as beautiful as an
artist makes them.
Kira picks up one of the trees -- an ugly shrub.

Then takes

LORD KIRA
Left on their own these trees grow
wild and out of control. It takes
the meticulous eye of an artist to
see, to understand, to recognize a
single branch that may mask the
beauty within. A branch that left

whole. Not unlike ronin.
(beat)
It is up to the artist to recognize
this blight, for it is not until he
clips that branch away -Kira cruelly snips off a branch.
LORD KIRA
-- that the beauty of what lies
beneath is revealed.
Kira turns and looks at Mika. Though he’s speaking of the
tree, it’s clear he’s speaking about her.
LORD KIRA
Now, it is up to the artist to
gently manipulate the remaining
branches. Not to cut, but to
coerce its shape. To coax it. To
train it.
Kira grabs a branch and bends it down, using a piece of twine
to tie it down. He considers it for a second, then sets the
tree aside. Takes another from the shelf.
LORD KIRA
Slowly. Steadily. With increasing
pressure so that in time, with
patience, the branch eventually
ceases to resist the artist’s
desires...
Kira releases a branch that has been tied -- and it stays in

Kira enters and shuts the door behind him. A SHADOWY FIGURE
stands with his back to us at the edge of the balcony
overlooking the thousand foot drop below.
LORD KIRA
Thank you for waiting.
The figure nods almost imperceptibly. As Kira angles around,
we get a better look at the man. Tall, stacked with corded
muscle. Dressed in a traditional ninjutsu outfit so dark red
it is almost back. A mask across the lower half of his face
conceals his identity and leaves only his EYES exposed -eyes that burn with an intelligence and remorselessness that
chills our blood.
The NINJA CLANLORD is quite possibly the most imposing figure
this side of the Shogun.
LORD KIRA (CONT'D)
I wish to hire your ninja clan to
deal with the ronin. Oishi in
particular.
The Clanlord’s voice is the unfathomable crack and rumble of
deep-earth coal being crushed to diamonds.
NINJA CLANLORD
Did I not just overhear your spy
say he was broken?
There’s a smirk in his voice.
LORD KIRA
I have not gotten to where I am

Kira tosses a heavy purse of gold kobans to him. Only the
Ninja Lord’s hand moves, snatching it out of the air like a
snake grabbing a bird in flight.

AERIAL SHOT - NAGASAKI BAY - DAY
A bustling port city surrounds Nagasaki’s gorgeous harbor...
But floating in the middle of the Bay FIND:
DEJIMA ISLAND
A small, ARTIFICIAL ISLAND built as a trading outpost for the
Dutch. The fan-shaped islet is kept separate from the
mainland by a LONG STONE BRIDGE -- Japan’s equivalent of the
proverbial “ten-foot-pole” to keep foreigners from ever
touching Japanese soil.
Despite looks from the locals -OISHI
crosses the quarter-mile span of stone and steps onto the
island. Speaks to the first man he finds, a Japanese LABORER
in ridiculous Western clothes.
OISHI
I need to speak to the man in
charge.
The Laborer nods and motions for Oishi to follow.

Now TRACK WITH OISHI as he is led across the synthetic
island. Though a CLAUSTROPHOBIC MAZE of cargo crates and
livestock. Past laborers struggling to unload the two Dutch
East-India MERCHANT SHIPS moored there: the 18 sail
“Dolphijn” and the enormous “Rotterdam”.
POV - OISHI: scanning each worker’s face as he passes,
searching for signs of his men. All the laborers are
Japanese, clad in the cornflower blue coats of the Dutch, and
to a man, they are gaunt, dejected, STRUNG OUT.
As they pass the open door of a warehouse, Oishi sees

We can almost make out the man’s features --huge and unreal-but then the dark closes in once again.

No time to reload, the Pistoleer flips the gun around to use
as a club. When he swings, Oishi HALF-STEPS BACK and the

Oishi then HALF-STEPS FORWARD and separates the titan’s arm

Oishi stares up from the ground at his pursuers, breathing

The Kapitan stares hatefully at Oishi, a seething inferno of
impotent fury. With a roar, he reaches into his shoulder and

Oishi quickly makes his way down the foggy path toward the
temple. The glow of many lanterns blaze through the mist
ahead.
Oishi mounts the temple steps and ascends -INSIDE
And where he expects to find Asano’s three-hundred-and-fifty
loyal samurai warriors, fully-armed and ready to restore
their Lord’s name to glory -He is shocked to find only forty-three...
Oishi stares at the men, a quarter of them in their fifties
and sixties. One of them, HORIBE, is even in his late
seventies.
And there isn’t a stitch of steel between them.
OISHI
Where are the others?
Oishi stands momentarily dumbfounded. A man awaking from a
dream of heaven...only to find himself in hell.
Finally, an elderly warrior (CHUZAEMON) speaks up.
CHUZAEMON
We were once 350 strong.
at us.
MURAMATSU
We’re only 45.

Now look

KIMURA
You promised us honor, Oishi!

ISOGAI
We should have fought!
are we now?

What good

60.
The moment turns quiet.

Despairing.

Nearby, Sujo’s FALCON ruffles its feathers, sending a snow of
downy underfeathers to the temple floor.
Oishi steps forward.
OISHI
What good are we now?
Oishi extends his arm and takes the bird from Sujo.
its hood.

Removes

OISHI
Look at this falcon. Powerful.
Proud. Utterly without fear. His
skill at flying makes him the
unmatched hunter in the sky.
(beat)
Yet despite the thousands of
feathers that cover the falcon’s
body...only twenty give it flight.
Oishi swings his arm, casting the falcon into the air where
it BEATS THE AIR POWERFULLY with its wings, SOARING back to
Sujo. It settles on his wrist with a proud, noble shriek.
There’s real power in the moment. Each man stares at the
bird...then turns back to Oishi, who meets every one of their
eyes.
OISHI
You are the ones that came back.
You are the strongest, most loyal
samurai of the Asano clan. Will
you fight with me?
There is a beat as every man searches his soul, the decision
hanging in the balance until -VOICE (OS)
I will fight.
Everyone turns to see MINORU stride into the chamber. His
time in the mercenary company has hardened him. Honed him.
He is a serious warrior now.
The campaigneer meets the gaze of every man in the room,
challenging.
MINORU
I may not be samurai, but I owe
everything that I am to Lord
Asano...and I’m willing to give my
life if I can help you avenge his
death.

61.
One by one, the others stand.
everyone has risen.

The tide turns and soon

Oishi looks at the forty-six loyal men standing before him -ranging in age from 24 to 77 -- all willing to die for what
they believe in.
It’s not nearly enough…
But they will have to make do.
OISHI
Then we are forty-six united.
VOICE (OS)
Forty-seven.
Oishi turns to see -CHIKARA
-- entering the ring of men. The sixteen-year-old moves to
stand before his father; a boy on the precipice of manhood.
CHIKARA
Asano was my Lord as well.
Oishi considers his son’s words...
Then suddenly HURLS a sword at him lightning fast!
CATCHES the blade by the hilt with ease.

Chikara

In his RIGHT hand.
Oishi meets his son’s eyes with respect...and nods.
OISHI
(with finality)
Then if the gods will it...we shall
fight as forty-seven.
CUT TO:
INT. SENGAKUJI TEMPLE - LATE NIGHT
Many of the men are still talking, catching up. Others
sleep. Oishi is sitting beside a small fire, contemplating
his son who dozes peacefully nearby, when Minoru quietly
walks over and sits down.
Minoru speaks quietly so as not to wake the boy.
MINORU
(re: Chikara)
He’s grown.

62.
OISHI
So have you. You look like
Hachiman.
MINORU
I feel like him. Ancient.
Eternally exhausted.
Oishi looks at Minoru, genuine mirth touches his features.
OISHI
It is good to see you again,
Minoru.
The two fall into a peaceful silence. But it cannot last and
dissolves into more serious matters at hand.
MINORU
Lady Asano?
(nods)
Alive.

OISHI

Minoru reads between the lines.
MINORU
What aren’t you telling me?
OISHI
She is to be married to Kira on the
eve of the new moon.
We sense it takes every ounce of iron control Minoru has to
keep from going after her that very second.
MINORU
Then how shall we proceed?
OISHI
To fight a war, an army needs two
things: fire in its belly and
steel in its hand... The first we
have.
(dramatic beat)
Now it’s time to get the latter.
And as the two men meet eyes, HARD CUT TO:
ECU - A JAPANESE WOODBLOCK
with an image carved in relief. Carefully, an ARTISAN coats
the surface with ink, then presses a large canvas against it,
creating an amazing WOODBLOCK PRINT of Mt. Fuji at sunrise as
seen from a busy marketplace at Edo.

63.
Now TILT UP from the canvas to reveal the exact same
image...but this time it’s real. We are:
EXT. CITY MARKETPLACE - OUTSIDE EDO - DAY
The Artisan’s quarter.

Metalsmiths’ Alley, specifically.

Chikara wanders through in wonder. Past Isogai who
critically examines a sword maker’s wares. Then on past
another stall where Minoru is doing the same -- until his eye
catches on something in particular.
Minoru lifts a smooth white cube from the table.
MINORU
How much for the block of ivory?
VENDOR
Set it down, halfbreed.
sell to your kind.

We don’t

But Minoru is used to this. Simply pulls his entire coin
belt and sets it down. Ten times what the thing is worth.
Everything he’s ever saved.
The vendor stares at the money...and his prejudice is
overcome by practical greed.
VENDOR (CONT’D)
Take it and go. And don’t tell
anyone where you bought it!
Chikara continues on, to where he hears his father ahead.
OISHI (OS)
And these are your best fighting
pieces?
Chikara joins his father at a swordsmith’s stall, where Oishi
is inspecting a regal-looking katana.
SWORDMAKER
The highest quality in all Edo.
Officially recognized by the
Emperor.
Working the bellows in the rear of the stall, an elderly ONEARMED AINU (an aboriginal Japanese) CHUCKLES at the
Swordmaker’s sales pitch. The guy is 80 if he’s a day and
has a beard to his navel.
The Swordmaker throws an irritated glance to shut him up, and
tries to continue.

64.
SWORDMAKER (CONT’D)
Examine the detail of the
scrollwork. So delicate. So
beautiful -In response, the Ainu blows his nose like a trumpet, using
his dirty beard as a Kleenex, and laughs like a madman.
The Swordmaker has had enough, hurling a handful of iron
tsuba at the toothless old man.
SWORDMAKER (CONT’D)
I’ll teach you to cackle, you
filthy dung monkey!
The Ainu skitters back into the shadows. As the Swordmaker
goes to chase him away, Chikara picks up the regal sword.
CHIKARA
These are the ones we are looking
for, right, Father? They are
beautiful blades.
OISHI
And nothing more.
Chikara is confused. Oishi takes the beautiful blade from
his hands and explains patiently. A good teacher. A great
father.
OISHI (CONT’D)
The steel tells all. If a
swordmaker is lazy and folds the
metal only a handful of times, the
carbon doesn’t get distributed and
the iron remains soft.
Oishi presses on the sword edge with his thumb -CHIKARA
Careful, Father!
-- but rather than cut him, the metal BENDS like butter. The
sight impresses Chikara...but affects Oishi in a deeper way.
OISHI
How many samurai have been sent to
their deaths with a weapon like
this in their hands?
(shakes his head sadly)
Terrible...
Oishi slides the blade back into its scabbard just as the
Swordmaker returns.

65.
SWORDMAKER
I’m sorry about that foul creature.
Now, let us back to business -OISHI
Clearly you are a master
swordmaker...but I’m afraid this is
far beyond what we could afford.
(bows humbly)
I thank you for your time.
SWORDMAKER
Thank me in future by not wasting
it!
As Oishi continues down the line of stalls, Chikara’s
attention is drawn to a commotion down the alley.
Three brash samurai -- Noto HARES from their armor -- make
their way through the street, shouting drunkenly and sharply
slapping people aside with the flat of their blades.
HARE LEADER
Move, you louts!
Merchants and customers scramble to get out of their way. As
they near the stall where Chikara stands, the leader of the
Hares turns to a pretty FRUIT VENDOR GIRL in her stall.
HARE LEADER (CONT’D)
We are hungry. Have you any winter
melons?
FRUIT VENDOR GIRL
No, my lords -Lies!

NOTO HARE #1
She hides them here!

#1 suddenly grabs her and tears her silk robes open, exposing
her generous bosom.
NOTO HARE #1 (CONT’D)
I ask you, are those not melons?!
The men laugh as she struggles to cover up, and #1 is giving
her breasts a rough squeeze when the HARE LEADER turns and
sees Chikara staring at him.
HARE LEADER
Is there a problem, peasant?
Chikara hesitates.
Yes.

Knows he shouldn’t say anything, but --

CHIKARA
There is.

66.
The Hares stop and turn on Chikara, who doesn’t back an inch.
CHIKARA
Samurai are supposed to protect
their people, not prey upon them.
NOTO HARE #2
How dare you speak so insolently to
your betters!
CHIKARA
I see no betters before me.
There’s a dangerous moment.

The Leader steps forward.

HARE LEADER
The farmer’s got a little pluck in
him.
(turns to Hare #2)
Cut it out.
Hare #2 draws his sword with relish, and as he goes to slap
Chikara with the flat of the blade -And in that instant, Chikara’s instinct overrules all
rational thought. Completely on reflex, Chikara sidesteps
the blow and trap-locks the sword out of #2’s hands. Before
the Hares can blink, the sword is now in Chikara’s hands and - WHAMMM!! -- he smashes #2 across the face with it.
Teeth go flying and #2 drops like a felled tree.
All this happens within a single heartbeat.
The Hares look at one another -- this is no simple farmer.
Now the Leader draws his weapons, two double daggers known as
RABBIT’S TEETH, and springs at Chikara, unleashing an INTENSE
FLURRY OF BLOWS.
Chikara stumbles back, surprised by the speed and ferocity of
the strikes. Chikara blocks, but quickly finds himself so
overwhelmed by the onslaught...
...that he makes a fatal mistake and INSTINCTIVELY SWITCHES
HIS SWORD TO HIS DOMINANT LEFT HAND.
THE HARE LEADER
sees opening and as he moves to deliver the death blow -CLACKK! The Hare Leader’s dual blades are blocked by a
WALKING STICK.

67.
The Leader whips around -- to confront a man standing before
him. OISHI. There’s a moment...then the Leader recognizes
him.
Ronin..!

HARE LEADER

All around, thirty ears perk up at the word. Instantly,
Oishi and his men go for weapons, ready to fight -- but the
Hares do what they what they do best and TAKE OFF RUNNING to
alert their daimyo.
Oishi turns to his men.
OISHI
If they get away, our plans are
doomed.
Without another word, Hanjo and Isogai take off after Noto
Hare #1, while Oishi and Minoru follow the Hare Leader,
leaving Chikara alone in the dust.
THE HARE LEADER
Trained as a runner since birth, the Leader sprints through
the maze of Edo streets, desperately fast, rounding corners,
leaping off walls, shoving anyone to the ground who gets in
his way.
MINORU does his best to stay on his heels, but the bastard’s
unbelievably fast.
OISHI quickly realizes he won’t be able to keep up, and uses
his brain instead of his feet, cutting down an adjacent
alleyway, hoping to get ahead of the chase while -ISOGAI
is in hot pursuit of Noto Hare #1. As nearly 60-year-old
Hanjo starts to wheeze and fall back, Isogai calls out -ISOGAI
Don’t worry, old man, I’ve got it!
And Isogai takes off at speed, the entire hopes of the 47
ronin resting on his shoulders.
Hare #1 runs like a rabbit before the hounds. Were he not
drunk, he would certainly leave Isogai in the dust, but his
legs have lost their split-second timing and fleetness.
And Isogai is gaining.

68.
Watching his pursuer over his shoulder more than the way
ahead, Hare #1 rounds a corner -- and finds himself in a dead
end alley.
But just when we think he’ll stop, he doesn’t -- and runs
straight for the alley wall! With every ounce of speed he
can muster he LEAPS at the stones and REBOUNDS off them,
sailing over the head of Isogai and toward freedom --!!
But Isogai reaches up and grabs a foot as he passes -- and
SLAMS him down to the earth. WHAM!!
Now a desperate scrabble ensues, Hare #1 wielding his double
short swords like steel incisors. Isogai and he grapple on
the ground, but the Hare’s moves are blazingly fast and he’s
armored. Isogai’s attempts to harm him are thwarted by the
steel and slowly, the fight turns. Hare #1 gets the upper
hand, double blades poised above Isogai’s chest, and just as
he’s about to stab down -TWO ELDERLY HANDS reach into frame, grip Hare #1’s helm and
WRENCH IT VIOLENTLY AROUND -- KRRRAAAACCKK! -- BREAKING his
neck.
Hare #1 drops, boneless as a doll, and Isogai looks up at his
savior. HANJO stands there.
HANJO
(pointedly)
Old man?
ISOGAI
I’m never going to hear the end of
this, am I?
Hanjo just smiles and we SLAM BACK TO-THE NOTO HARE LEADER
racing through the streets, Minoru hot on his heels. He
tries to lose his pursuer by taking a shortcut beneath a
building on stilts --- to find his only means of escape BLOCKED as OISHI’s shape
fills the exit. The Leader turns to double back, but now
Minoru blocks that way as well.
The Hare Leader’s eyes flick back and forth wildly. He’s
trapped. And as Oishi and Minoru draw their weapons and
start closing in for the kill in perfect synchronicity, the
Leader sighs, knowing he’s well and truly fucked...
CUT TO:

EXT. CITY MARKETPLACE - MOMENTS LATER
Chikara stands at the Fruit Vendor Girl’s stall making sure
she’s okay.
CHIKARA
Are you certain you are all right?
She refuses to make eye contact. A moment later, her FATHER
steps up and pushes Chikara away. Glares at him.

Now go.
Shocked, Chikara looks around...and sees the entire
marketplace FOCUSED on him. Looks of disdain. Anger.
Hatred.
And for the first time for Chikara, what it truly means to be
ronin hits home.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. CITY - LATER
The five ronin have regathered. Minoru sits beneath a tree,
carving the block of ivory he bought. In the b.g., Hanjo and
Isogai dump the bodies of the slain Hares in the river.
Now PAN OVER TO REVEAL Chikara sitting on a rock, removed
from the group.
After a moment, Oishi approaches his son.
Neither says a word, until finally --

Sits beside him.

OISHI
(quietly)
Listen, Chikara... The only
advantage we have against Kira, the
only possible chance, is by means
of surprise. They must continue to
think we are broken and not a
threat.

OISHI (CONT'D)
You weren’t thinking. You must
suppress your pride. There will be
a time to fight. This is not it.
Humiliated, Chikara looks up at his father.
CHIKARA
Do you wish me to go home?
Oishi considers...then shakes his head.
OISHI
No. We are only 47. We cannot
afford to lose a single blade...
Chikara bows his head in shame as Oishi rises and strides
off.
CUT TO:
EXT. RURAL ROAD - LATER
Minoru walks beside Chikara, who is drowning in a sea of selfdoubt.
CHIKARA
I am so...ashamed.
Minoru looks him in the eye.

Man to man.

MINORU
Then redeem yourself.
CHIKARA
But, I’m cursed. No matter how
hard I try to suppress it, my left
hand is dominant. If not for my
father intervening back there...
Chikara doesn’t finish the thought.

It’s too terrible.

into a strength.
But how?

There is kindness in Minoru’s look. And strength. It’s just
the salve for Chikara’s wounded pride. Minoru walks away,
and as Chikara processes what he’s said -SFX:

SOMEONE GIGGLES BEHIND CHIKARA.

Chikara turns to look...but sees no one there.
Chikara continues walking -- and stops short when the MAD
GIGGLING recommences. He spins around, and this time he sees
the ONE-ARMED AINU tottering after him, almost upon him.
ONE-ARMED AINU
..hee-hee...i know who you
are...hee-hee...I know what you’re
looking for...
As the toothless old vagabond nears him, Chikara backs away
in panic and trips, falling flat on his ass. The Ainu
descends on him, greasy beard falling in Chikara’s face.

Minoru and the others look to Oishi, concerned.

ISOGAI
Should I kill him?
ONE-ARMED AINU
Kill me? When I’m the only one in
the city who knows how to find good
blades, real blades, instead of
these...ornaments.
He spits out the last word with disgust.
Where?

The Ainu begins coughing theatrically, leaning heavily on his
walking staff.

Oishi’s men sit around as the One-Armed Ainu loudly finishes
a bowl of soup and uses his beard as a napkin. But when he
signals for a refill of his sake cup, Isogai explodes.
ISOGAI
Why are we wasting our time?! He
knows nothing! He’s simply trying
to beg sake off us!

73.
But before Isogai has finished his rant, the old man slides
his walking stick apart to reveal THE MOST BEAUTIFUL EXAMPLE
OF SWORDMAKING WE HAVE EVER SEEN.
Even Minoru, completely engrossed in carving his ivory block,
looks up in wonder.
In his hands, the Ainu holds a DOUBLE-EDGED KATANA, polished
mirror bright. Like liquid silver. A steel dream...
Words choke in Isogai’s throat.

Oishi stares in open

From the reverence in his tone, we can tell it’s the Holy
Grail of swordmaking.
How..?

OISHI (CONT’D)

ONE-ARMED AINU
The rest of Japan may have
forgotten the true art of
swordmaking...but the Ainu have
not.
And as the old man begins to tell the story, PUSH IN on the
coals in the brazier on the table and -DISSOLVE TO:
A RIVER OF FLOWING LAVA
-- snaking beneath the earth.

We are:

INT. MT. FUJI
-- where we FOLLOW the lava flow through a maze of VOLCANIC
TUNNELS formed of solidified molten rock. Orange light
suffuses the tunnels, making them glow. From somewhere
ahead, and the sound of SMITHS’ HAMMERS can be heard.
ONE-ARMED AINU (VO)
Frustrated at the deterioration of
the swordmaking art, the
descendants of legendary swordmaker
Amakuni retreated into the lava
tunnels beneath Mt. Fuji to
rediscover their ancestor’s lost
techniques.

74.
Now we round a bend in the tunnel and enter Hell’s Foundry -an awesome chamber of stalactites and stalagmites where an
army of ONI (fierce Japanese demons) work iron into steel
using bubbling calderas of lava as their furnace.
ONE-ARMED AINU (VO) (CONT’D)
Down there in the dark, they used
the earth as their forge. With no
sun to tell the time, the
swordmakers worked relentlessly,
day and night, caring only for
their craft, their bodies changing,
becoming muscled from the hammer,
their skin baked red as kiln bricks
from the unending heat, their eyes
seared milky white from staring at
the glow of molten metal.
CLOSE IN on the largest of the Oni as he pulls a GIGANTIC
BLADE from a lava pot. It glows cherry red as he places it
on an iron deposit and raises a MASSIVE HAMMER to shape it-ONE-ARMED AINU (VO) (CONT’D)

pretty. It would never stand up in

Then strike at me.

When Isogai hesitates, the Ainu moves lightning fast,
snatching up his sword with his lone arm and ATTACKING!
Isogai reacts on decades of hard-drilled instinct, parrying
the blow -- CRAAANG! -- then CHOPPING the Ainu across the
middle, cleaving him in two!
ISOGAI
You should not have struck at me,
old man. I regret that I had to
kill you.
But the Ainu doesn’t fall.

And instead, starts to laugh.

ONE-ARMED AINU
And I regret that you are in error.
You’ve done me no harm.
At this, the Ainu straightens and we see he’s completely
unharmed. Isogai gapes in awe...until he sees his blade
laying on the ground, SHATTERED. He’s been standing there
like an idiot, holding only the handle of his sword.
And the Ainu’s sword is untouched.
Nothing.
Oishi turns to him.

And smiles.

Not a nick on it.

76.
OISHI
We’ll take 47.
EXT. TAVERN - WIDE SHOT - LATER
As the group leaves the inn, Oishi SENSES someone or
something watching them from the dark forest.
Oishi turns. Scans the woods. But when he finds nothing, he
turns back and continues on his way.
It is only when Oishi is gone that a SHAPE moves from it’s
hiding place -- perched high in the shadows of a tree with
metal climbing claws on hands and feet. The most feared and
loathed type of mercenary in all of Japan.
The NINJA bounds impossibly from treetop to treetop, stalking
its prey...
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. MOUNT FUJI - ESTABLISHING
The world’s most-recognizable stratovolcano stands
dramatically against the horizon, a THICK COLUMN OF ASH AND
SMOKE rising from its snowy cone.
At the base of the mountain -OISHI
-- leads a half-dozen of his ronin and a complement of
BEARERS pulling wagons through the bamboo forest known as the
“Sea of Trees”. Soon, a clearing reveals a STRUCTURE ON
STILTS built up against the side of the mountain.
Sitting abandoned for several years, the Lotus Peak looks
more like a haunted house than a tea room.
INT. ABANDONED TEAHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Shrouded in cobwebs, dust and deep shadows...
The tea hall is a single greatroom, filled with shoji walls
that could subdivide the space into numerous private tea
rooms.
HANJO
I think we’ve been had.
Oishi says nothing, moving forward through the darkened
space. The others follow. And as they do...

77.
We NOTICE the maze of shoji walls begin to SILENTLY SHIFT
around them. Unnoticed by Oishi’s men, the ricepaper walls
SLIDE into place, SEPARATING the group into smaller and
smaller factions. And just as the trap is about to spring -OISHI notices a BROKEN COBWEB. And then another. And as his
eyes track a SERIES OF BROKEN COBWEBS up the walls and into
the shadows, realization hits -Someone has scaled the walls!
SHINOBI!

Someone is in here with us!

OISHI

Oishi whips his sword out and up before his face just as a
NINJA strikes from the ceiling shadows like a cobra, spitting
a SPRAY OF GREEN POISON in his face.
ECU AS THE POISON SPRAY hits the flat of Oishi’s blade and is
DEFLECTED into two separate streams away from Oishi’s nose
and mouth!
Oishi wheels away -- just in time to see a small clay BALL
with a LIT FUSE tossed among the samurai. BOOOOM!!
The Thunderclap goes off like a cannon, DEAFENING SOUND and
BLINDING LIGHT that reveals THE WALLS ARE CRAWLING WITH
NINJA!
[SFX NOTE: As a result of the grenade, the only sound in the
following scene is the TINNY RINGING of Oishi’s ears.]
As the samurai try to shake off the effects of the blast, the
Ninja STRIKE. Smouldering flames illuminate glimpses of HOOK
AND CHAIN grabbing people under their chins and YANKING them
up into the darkness. Ninja MATERIALIZING from the shadows
and striking with SHURIKKEN, DISK HARPOONS, TIGER CLAWS.
ONE BEARER tries stay out of range of a ninja with a spear -but realizes too late when it guts him from across the room
that the SPEAR IS EXTENDABLE!
It’s like the ambush out of Aliens. The ninja materialize
from the dark, attack with inhuman ferocity, then disappear
back into shadow.
THE BEARERS panic, dying in droves, while -OISHI’S MEN master their fear and battle for their lives.
Suddenly, a chain wraps around Oishi’s sword and RIPS IT AWAY
into the dark as another ninja attacks with ninja-to, the
distinctive ninja straight sword.

78.
Reacting without thought, Oishi STEPS INTO THE ATTACK and
SLAPS THE BLADE ASIDE with the flat of his hand -- then grabs
the sword’s guard with his fingers and YANKS it out of the
ninja’s hands, dispatching him with a move called Flowing
Water.
OISHI
Ronin, to me!
MINORU divides one dark warrior into four equal parts, then
turns -- as a NINJA POISONER rises from the dark before him!
The Poisoner spits like a snake, but Minoru is faster,
whipping his sword across the man’s neck -- and a GUSH OF
PURPLISH TOXIN rushes down the poisoner’s chest from his
gaping throat!
One by one OISHI AND HIS MEN fight their way to each other.
Battle back to back against the dark tide of assassins.
But the Ninja have numbers and surprise, forcing our heroes
into -THE DEPTHS OF THE TEAHOUSE
-- where there are no windows.

No doors.

And no hope for escape.
Oishi and his men fight like lions, battling against the
crush of assailants, but soon find their backs against the
teahouse’s rear wall. Nowhere else to go.
Razor-sharp spear points MATERIALIZE from the dark, followed
by the ninja warriors who carry them.
OISHI
Come then, you faceless cowards.
(whips blood off his
sword)
My blade still thirsts.
The Ninja spearmen CHARGE. Oishi GRABS a spear thrust at his
chest, stopping it from impaling him, but the kinetic force
behind the charge is enough to DRIVE HIM BACK into the wall --- AND THROUGH IT! Wood cracks and splinters as Oishi and
his men are propelled through the false rear wall of the
teahouse and into -A VOLCANIC TUNNEL
-- illuminated by pools of molten lava bubbling up through
the earth.

Instantly, twenty monstrous OGRES look up from their
metalwork. Milky eyes glaring. Rotted teeth snarling.
Impossible muscles rippling beneath red, baked skin.
There is a terrible frozen moment, then -- CRRRRAAAASSHH!! -an ENORMOUS HAMMER turns a chunk of volcanic rock to fine
dust an inch from Oishi’s face!
Oishi leaps back as a SCAR-FACED OGRE charges from the
shadows impossibly fast, BELLOWING, and strikes again.
Oishi blocks the blow with his sword -- which SHATTERS as if
it were made of glass.
Gods...

OISHI

And as the inhuman beast strikes again -ANOTHER ANGLE
As WAVES OF OGRES AND NINJAS crash against Oishi’s men,
crushing them in nightmarish battle. The ronin fight for
their lives in an impossible, terrifying three-way-battle!
OISHI
is driven back by the Scar-Faced Ogre’s relentless assault.
Hammerblow after hammerblow whooshes past his face with
enough force to whip his hair wildly about his face.
But just as the Ogre lunges to strike again, Oishi reverses
his footwork and steps in to perform a move known as Dog
Steals Bone and DISARMS the brute, sending his hammer
thudding to the floor.
Defenseless, the Ogre freezes and Oishi STRIKES!
Ako’s swordmaster swings --

But as

OISHI
(yells at Ogre)
DOWN!
Oishi shoves the monster down and THRUSTS his sword an inch
above its head -- to SKEWER a NINJA about to cleave the Ogre
in half!
Then Oishi darts off, running into the heart of the battle.
THE SCAR-FACED OGRE watches him go, realization dawning
across his brutish face the man could’ve killed him. That
the ronin are not enemies. But the ninja...
Scar-Face picks up his hammer and BELLOWS in his savage
tongue at his Ainu brethren.
ALL AROUND
the Ogres immediately CEASE battling Oishi’s ronin...and turn
their fury on the ninja.
HANJO can’t believe it when the monster he’s fighting
suddenly turns and stands beside him to face two ninja with
chain and sickle.
BASHO is getting cut repeatedly by a quick little ninja
wielding two daggers when -- WHAM! -- a TITANIC MALLET
hammers the little bastard’s head down into his chest cavity.
The Ogre responsible steps from the dark and hands Basho an
extra mallet.
ISOGAI dispatches three ninja and turns in time to see a
nearby Ogre get his arm HACKED OFF AT THE ELBOW by a NAGINATA
NINJA. But the Ogre isn’t done fighting. Instead, it shoves
its bleeding stump deep into a red-hot brazier of coals,
cauterizing the wound, then ROARS and dispatches the Naginata
wielder.
ISOGAI
Now that he didn’t expect!
But just then, a fresh wave of ninja enter the caves, led by
a familiar face -- the fearsome Ninja Clanlord -- who
dispatches three ogres with terrifying ease.
Seeing them coming -OISHI
tosses his broken sword aside and pulls an unfinished one
from the heat of an Ainu forge. The blade is amazingly
beautiful, GLOWING RED HOT like something out of legend.

81.
When a ninja slashes at him, Oishi reflexively blocks with
the burning blade -- and SHATTERS the ninja’s weapon.
As the ninja tries to draw another weapon, Oishi QUENCHES the
molten blade in his belly. SSSSsssss! The ninja falls, his
clothes BURSTING INTO FLAME wherever the blade touches.
Oishi looks at the makers mark on the sword.
OISHI
Koto blade...
Oishi grabs two more from the kiln and hurls them toward -Minoru!

OISHI

MINORU
dispatches two ninja with his shattered swords, only nubs of
blade left, and as a half-dozen more close in -- SSSSsss!
SSSSsssss! -- two red-hot blades thunk into the backs of two
of his assailants, impaling them and igniting their clothes.
Minoru wastes no time, snatching the glowing swords from the
backs of the fallen and whirling on his attackers like a
blazing cyclone.
CHIKARA
is fighting one ninja, when he suddenly finds himself
surrounded by a dozen more. The situation is about to turn
deadly when -A HUGE HAND clamps down on his neck from behind and YANKS HIM
BACKWARDS. Another ninja?!
No. It’s the Scar-Faced Ogre. He’s dragged Chikara back to
the edge of a LAKE OF LAVA. There’s nowhere for them to go.
But as the ninja surge forward to kill them, Scar-Face raises
his mallet high and SWINGS -But not at the Ninja.

AT THE LAVA!

FWOOOSH! The hammer sends a SHEET OF LAVA at the attacking
ninja who scream and burn. Instantly, Chikara and Scar-Face
charge forward, slashing and bashing the ninja down.
INT. AINU SWORDWORKS - ANOTHER ANGLE
Now all of Oishi’s men begin grabbing up koto blades out of
kilns, out of forges. And the battlegrounds becomes alight:
flaming swords against shadowy ninja.

82.
And the tides begin to turn.
OISHI fights with the precision and grace of his rank,
shattering ninja weapons setting fire to ninja with every
stroke of his legendary blade.
Quickly, the ninja are overcome, slain to a man, except for
the -NINJA CLANLORD
-- who sidesteps a battle with SMOKE BOMBS and races off
through the caves.
But Oishi and Minoru are already in pursuit, chasing the
Ninja Lord through a series of steam-filled tunnels and into-A STALACTITE-FILLED CHAMBER
-- where a hundred bubbling pools of lava dot the cave floor.
Oishi and Minoru catch the Ninja Lord and the fight is on:
the ronin’s glowing swords working in tandem against the
Ninja Lord’s terrible chain and claw.
The tempo of the battle gets faster and faster, until their
moves are simply a blur.
And that’s when the Clanlord takes it up a notch.
Suddenly, Oishi and Minoru’s concentrated attacks are
outpaced by the Ninja Lord’s IMPOSSIBLE SPEED and, for the
first time ever, Oishi finds himself OUTSKILLED and on the
defensive.
The Clan Lord unleashes a flurry of chainwork that finds the
holes in Oishi’s blocks, in Minoru’s ripostes, slashing them,
bashing them, forcing them back to the edge of a CALDERA OF
LAVA where Oishi and Minoru fight, teetering for balance at
the edge of the molten pool...
Seeing his opportunity, the Clan Lord SMILES.

But just as he

they came.

With Mt. Fuji pointing heavenward in the plum-colored sky
behind them, Oishi bows deeply before the Scar-Faced Ogre,
clearly the Ainu leader. Minoru and Chikara do the same.
OISHI
Thank you, noble one.
The Scar-Faced Ogre returns the bow, then looks Oishi in the
eye. Speaks with a voice like the grumbling of deep caverns.
Something he hasn’t done in years.
SCAR-FACED OGRE
May you..be strong and
diligent...in your deeds.
And with a final bow, the ronin depart, and we -TIME CUT TO:

It is clear they have been travelling hard, for all sleep on

Except for two.
While the others sleep, Minoru and Chikara, practice
swordwork by the light of the campfire. Minoru instructs him
in several maneuvers, counterbalancing his left-handedness
with a knife in his right hand. And as the two practice
maneuvers again and again, Chikara getting better with each

An ESTABLISHING SHOT of a landscape of snowcapped peaks and

And dominating all from three thousand feet up the steep
snowy mountainside, FIND Kira’s impregnable YAMASHIRO (castle
fortress) looming over the world like a grim stone threat.

84.
Even from our aerial shot, we can see that wedding
preparations are underway below. Cheerful silks being
arranged. Red lanterns being hung. Excessive pomp and
circumstance that is the hallmark of the Master of Protocol.
But even while all these festivities are being prepared, in
another part of the castle, the emotional climate is very
different.
EXT. KIRA’S FORTRESS - BALCONY
Mika and Lord Kira sit in heavy robes, staring out at a frostrimed koi pond in a winter garden below. Candles float on
the surface, the fish move sluggishly below.
It’s majestic and beautiful, but somehow very sad.
They sit in silence, the only sound the quiet movements of a
SCRAWNY BOY fanning a brazier to keep them warm while he
himself shivers in his thin kimono. Then -LORD KIRA

Spring departs.
Birds cry.
Fishes’ eyes are filled with tears.

Are you familiar with the works of
Basho?
But Mika is more concerned about the shivering boy.
MIKA
The child is cold.
LORD KIRA
Is this so?
(turns to the boy)
Are you cold, boy? Do you wish for
me to send you away?
It’s not a threat.

Not quite.

The boy shakes his head.

No, my Lord. I am warm.

Kira pours thick green tea into earthenware raku tea bowls

LORD KIRA (CONT’D)
As you are about a great many
things...
With his back momentarily turned away, Mika seizes the
opportunity and slips a SMALL SACHET OF POWDER from the
sleeve of her robe. Pours the contents into Kira’s drink.
She conceals the sachet just in time as Kira turns around and
picks up his tea cup. He lifts it to his lips and is about
to drink --- when he NOTICES Mika watching him with interest. It’s the
first time she’s done so. Kira instantly becomes suspicious.
Realizing her mistake, Mika looks calmly away...but it’s too
late. Kira notices several GRANULES on the table by his cup.
Kira’s eyes narrow.

this.

LORD KIRA (CONT’D)
Warm yourself. Drink

The boy is hesitant, then takes the cup with trembling hands,
savoring the warmth. Mika watches the boy. Kira watches
her. And just as the boy tilts the cup to his lips -No!

MIKA

-- Mika breaks and SLAPS the cup out of his hands, shattering
it against the ground.
Kira looms over her as she crumples to the ground, weeping.
LORD KIRA
How like your father you are...
Rash. And a fool.
Kira leans down and takes her face in his hands.
LORD KIRA (CONT’D)
And so close to meeting his same
fate. You play at games where you
do not fully comprehend the stakes.
But I promise you this: when we
are wed -(venomous)
I will teach them to you.

86.
Lord Kira strides away, leaving Mika empty and devastated on
the balcony, staring helplessly out at the foothills beyond
her reach below.
And as she does, PUSH IN and VFX SKIM miles down the
mountainside to -EXT. FOOTHILLS - JAPANESE COUNTRYSIDE - SAME TIME
-- where Oishi, Minoru and a dozen others belly-crawl through
the long grass to reach a vantage point at the top of a rise.
Far above them, Kira’s castle fortress clutches the
mountaintop like some sinister stone spider.
The ronin stare at it, calculating.
OKUDA
We should attack tonight. It will
be a long climb, but our thirst for
justice will fuel us -Oishi shakes his head.
OISHI
Attacking Kira’s stronghold would
be a futile gesture. The walls are
impregnable and he garrisons a
thousand soldiers inside.
(beat)
No. Any attempt on his fortress
would be doomed to failure.
OKUDA
Then what have we travelled all
this way for? To wait for Kira to
march down the hill and present
himself to us.
(imitating Kira)
Why, hello, Oishi. Here’s my neck.
Strike swiftly please.
A ironic smirk crinkles Oishi’s eyes.
OISHI
That is exactly what we are going
to do.
Okuda and the others are confused. So Oishi directs their
gaze, not up at Kira’s fortress...but down at his fiefdom in
the valley below.
At the foot of the mountain sits Kira’s jinaimachi -- or
temple town -- comprised of various community buildings and
farms that all bear Lord Kira’s FAMILY CREST: a red octopus
against a golden field.

87.
OISHI (CONT’D)
Lady Asano’s period of mourning
comes to an end in two days. In
honor of their union, Kira has
ordered the entire realm to pay a
tribute at the Founder’s Temple.
Oishi points at the two-story wooden structure in the center
of the rural village. Sohei, or warrior monks, move about
the temple in their distinctive robes the color of dried
blood.
OISHI (CONT’D)
And Kira himself will be there to
collect the prize.
(beat)
Greed ever diminishes wisdom...
Oishi turns back to his men, determined.
OISHI (CONT'D)
And the very impulse that drove him
to betray our lord, is the same
weapon we will use against him.
And off Oishi’s words, Minoru turns and looks up at the
castle. Stares as if searching for Mika.
Almost as if the two are connected, and he is returning her
earlier gaze...
CUT TO:
AN ORNATE PALANQUIN
So massive and gaudy, it can only belong to one man.
Thirty men bear the garish litter toward the center of town,
escorted by a ring of two hundred heavily-armed soldiers.
When they reach the Temple, Lord Kira steps out in a bombast
of silk and blackened teeth.
As he steps inside, PULL BACK TO REVEAL we are:
EXT. KIRA’S TEMPLE TOWN - THE NEXT MORNING
Abuzz with activity, centering on the Founder’s Temple.
Thousands of merchants, townsfolk and farmers come from all
across the land bearing their wedding tributes in the form of
rice, livestock, textiles or coin.
Soldiers and monks herd everyone into an orderly line that
extends hundreds of yards out of the temple.

88.
At the edge of town, NOTICE a LONE FARMER entering the
village, carrying his offering of two bolts of silk. As the
farmer gets closer and we get a peek beneath his broad hat,
we realize it’s OISHI in disguise.
As Oishi nears the temple, he blends in with the crowd,
subtly glances around, taking everything in.
Formulating a battle plan...
POV OISHI
Noting the positions of the soldiers around the temple...
The MATCHLOCK MUSKETS they carry...
The four CANNONS stationed beside the temple and, as a
soldier exits, a small magazine room where BARRELS OF
GUNPOWDER (marked with the Dutch East India crest) are
stored...

as Oishi is goaded by the soldiers into the long line of
farmers to make his offering and meekly complies.
Once there, he looks around and SPOTS familiar faces
interspersed throughout the crowd.

ISOGAI disguised as an

As a cart filled with wedding gifts rumbles past on its way
up the mountain, MINORU, disguised as a peasant, maneuvers
close enough to SLIP IN A SMALL WRAPPED PACKAGE of his own.
The line moves forward and soon Oishi finds himself at the
temple steps. Above the doorway hangs an immense painting of
the temple’s founder, Lord Kira. Below that is a smaller,
almost stingy one of the Supreme Buddha.
Oishi stops for a moment, struck by the mind-boggling vanity
of it all.
YOU THERE!

VOICE (OS)

Suddenly -- WAAAAP! -- Oishi is struck across the shoulders
by a sword scabbard. An IMPOSING SOLDIER looms before him.
Oishi tries to keep his face downcast as the Soldier studies
him, but --

89.
IMPOSING SOLDIER
Look at me.
(when Oishi doesn’t)
LOOK AT ME!
Oishi does.

And just as we’re sure he’s about to be caught --

IMPOSING SOLDIER (CONT’D)
Keep the line moving.
Oishi is as surprised as we are. Nods readily and shuffles
away, ignoring the Soldier’s muttered curse of -IMPOSING SOLDIER (CONT’D)
Brainless peasants.
-- as he moves off into:
INT. FOUNDER’S TEMPLE - CONTINUOUS
Prayer candles and incense dominate the interior of the twostoried hondo -- or main hall -- filled with townsfolk.
LORD KIRA sits in a chair befitting his status, behind a
screen of gossamer silk to prevent the gaze of peasants from
sullying him. It is from there he surveys his offerings.
Oishi watches as a PIG FARMER approaches the screen and hands
over five piglets in a cart. An ACOLYTE records the
information in the official roll. Kira never says a word.
Kira’s functionary, the temple’s CHIEF MONK, does all the
interacting with the lesser peoples.
Next.

CHIEF MONK

As the Soldier escorts the farmer away, the Chief Monk turns
his gaze on Oishi.
CHIEF MONK (CONT’D)
Step forward.
Oishi steps before the screen shrouding Kira’s visage.
CHIEF MONK (CONT’D)
Name and offering?
OISHI
Two bolts of silk, Holy One.
The Chief Monk tries to take the bolts, but Oishi holds fast
to them. The Monk sighs and turns to the Acolyte.
CHIEF MONK
Note that they are exceedingly poor
specimens. Moth eaten.
(MORE)

90.
CHIEF MONK (CONT'D)
The cheapest sort.
(turns back to Oishi)
Is this insult all you bring your
liege lord?
OISHI
No, there is more...but I fear your
master will enjoy it even less.
The Chief Monk begins to grow suspicious.
CHIEF MONK
Who are you? State your name!
OISHI
With pleasure.
Oishi turns to the screen, eyes steely.
OISHI (CONT'D)
My name is Oishi Kuranosuke -(the silhouette reacts)
-- and the tribute I bring is the
vengeance of Lord Asano Naganori.
Realizing the danger the warrior monk goes for a weapon, but
in one swift move Oishi draws a sword concealed within the
bolt of silk -- so sharp that it SLICES through the thousand
layers of fabric as it is drawn out -- and SMASHES the monk
in the head with the steel butt of the blade.
The Chief Monk DROPS like rag doll.
Faster than anyone can react, Oishi slices through veiled
screen -- SCHRRIIIP! -- and is about to hack Kira down when-Oishi STOPS DEAD.
The man cowering before him is not Kira...but an effeminate
AIDE acting as his double. And as the implications of this
sink in-SFX: THE DISTINCTIVE CLICKS OF TWO DOZEN MUSKET SEAR LOCKS
BEING COCKED ECHOES AROUND THE ROOM.
Oishi looks up to see Kira RIFLE AND BOWMEN ringing the
balcony above, all with their weapons trained on him. And
below, every one of the warrior monks holds an exotic weapon
in hand -- WHIP CHAINS, TIGER HOOKS, IRON FANS.
The room goes deathly still, everyone holding their breath.
In the silence that follows, only one sound can be heard.
LAUGHTER. Oishi turns to see the Chief Monk, laughing
through blood-stained teeth.

91.
CHIEF MONK
We knew you would come.
How..?

OISHI

HEAVY FOOTSTEPS resound from an alcove...and like a demon
returned fresh from hell, the NINJA CLANLORD steps from the
shadows. Pulls down his mask to reveal half his face has
become a MELTED, SCARIFIED HORROR from the lava beneath Mt.
Fuji.
It’s the last person on earth Oishi wants to see.
CHIEF MONK
Kira is safe in his fortress,
ronin. Unlike you.
(to his musketeers above)
Kill him.
The crowd swiftly moves away from Oishi as the musketeers
draw a bead, and just as they are about to fire -One of the musketeers heads just SLIDES OFF HIS SHOULDERS and
TOPPLES to the floor below.
Another’s arm simply SEPARATES at the shoulder, dropping his
musket.
An archer SCREAMS as two feet of shining steel protrude
through his chest, lancing his heart.
Still another is CLEAVED IN ‘TWAIN, from crown to root, and
falls apart in two symmetrical pieces -- revealing Minoru
standing behind him.
As other ronin go to work on the rest and blood and body
parts rain down, the crowd ERUPTS IN CHAOS. Utter mayhem
ensues as two hundred villagers run in every direction.
Instantly -THE NINJA CLANLORD
turns to look back -- and discovers Oishi gone.
into the crowd.

Blended back

Around him, soldiers and warrior monks begin to drop as the
ronin attack like ghosts, materializing to slit a throat,
then vanishing back into the crowd.
In the pandemonium, it’s impossible to tell harmless villager
from foe. To the Chief Monk, there is only one solution.

92.
CHIEF MONK
LOCK THE DOORS! KILL EVERYONE
INSIDE! LET NO RONIN ESCAPE!
OUTSIDE
a dozen of Kira’s men begin to swing the massive temple doors
shut.
INSIDE
Muskets THUNDER. Arrows FLY. And Oishi sees their only
chance of escape closing. The doors are so colossal that
once they’re shut, there will be no opening them.
Amid the chaos, Oishi spots the sumo-sized Basho in the
crowd.
BASHO!

OISHI
THE DOOR!

The giant looks up and responds instantly, surging forward
and bowling a path through the crowd to reach the tremendous
doors a heartbeat before closing.
He hits them like a force of nature, driving the dozen men
trying to close them back a foot, their boots skidding loudly
across the stone floor.
But that’s where the forward momentum stops and the war of
strength begins. OUTSIDE, more men pile on the doors, trying
to force them shut, while INSIDE Basho strains mightily
against their combined efforts.
KIRA’S SOLDIERS AND WARRIOR MONKS
lash out at anyone within reach -- men, women, children -but find their weapons BLOCKED by ronin swords that appear
from nowhere, protecting the innocents then striking their
own lethal return blow.
An arrow about to take a child’s life is SEVERED IN MID-AIR
by Minoru’s saving sword -- and before the cleaved arrow can
fall to the ground, Minoru snatches it out of the sky and
stabs it into the face of an attacking warrior monk.
OISHI defends against three warrior monks, SHATTERING all
three of their weapons with a single angry strike.
But as much damage as they’re doing, the ronin are
desperately outnumbered and are starting to take heavy
casualties.

93.
ISOGAI and others take a hail of musket balls through the
shoulders, legs, arms.
HANJO barely slips aside from an iron fan slice chop meant to
brain him and loses his left ear for the effort.
MINORU ducks away from a decapitating swipe of a RAZOR-SHARP
WHIP CHAIN and we PUSH INTO A SLOW-MO ECU as the tip of the
enemy’s steel whip NICKS HIS NECK, drawing only a single drop
of blood.
And though he fells one opponent after another, OISHI’s back
is RAKED OPEN by dual tiger hooks.
They have to get out.
BASHO!

OISHI

ACROSS THE ROOM
Basho is a human pincushion of arrows, an easy target for
archers who do everything in their power to drop him.
But for all the arrows sticking out of his back, Basho
struggles titanically against-THE NOW TWENTY SOLDIERS ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE
who, in unison, try to force the doors closed enough for the
six soldiers waiting to drop the heavy WOODEN LOCK BAR -thick as the trunk of a great tree -- in place. It’s a war
of millimeters as the men try to force the lock bar in
place...but Basho holds the doors just a hair too wide for it
to fit.
INT. TEMPLE - CONTINUOUS
Another arrow buries itself in Basho’s back and he loses
valuable ground.
OISHI sees his men taking heavy damage and calls out again to
their only hope.
BASHO!!!

OISHI

And just as -THE SOLDIERS OUTSIDE
slide the lock bar in place --

94.
BASHO
hears his master’s voice and digs deep to the titan within
and SURGES FORWARD WITH EVERY LAST OUNCE OF SUPERHUMAN
STRENGTH --!!
AND SHATTERS THE BAR TO SPLINTERS, SENDING THE SOLDIERS
TUMBLING AND FORCING THE DOORS OPEN WIDE!
Instantly, the panicking crowd races through the opening, the
47 ronin blending in with them.
THE NINJA CLANLORD
races out of the temple with his soldiers and sohei -- and is
confronted by the sight of thousands of taxpayers racing away
from the temple in every conceivable direction.
Trying to find the ronin among the stampeding crowd would be
like trying to find a needle in a haystack...in the heart of
a raging typhoon.
Though suffering staggering injuries, Oishi and his men have
gotten away...
SLOW DISSOLVE TO:
A RED SILKEN CLOTH
Then a dozen ORACLE BONES are cast across it.
The turtle shell fragments tumble and come to rest, and two
tiny hands ENTER FRAME and begin to search by feel for the
ones that have landed with their inscribed Kanji characters
facing up.
PULL BACK TO REVEAL we are -INT. KIRA’S MOUNTAIN CASTLE - THE LORD’S QUARTERS -

LATER

Lord Kira waits impatiently for his fortune to be read by the
court PROPHETS -- a pair of ten-year-old children. The
divinators are fraternal twins, a boy and a girl.
It’s the boy whose hands feel the shells.
Well..?

LORD KIRA

When the boy looks up, we see his milky eyes and know that he
is BLIND. He looks to his sister and she stares into his
eyes. No words pass between them.
Then --

95.
GIRL PROPHET
He says you will travel great
distances. That a hundred thousand
shall prostrate themselves before
you as you pass. That even the
Shogun will bow before you in awe.
LORD KIRA
And how shall this honor occur?
The boy casts again and turns to his sister.
GIRL PROPHET
He says two feathers shall lift you
up. And on that day, you will live
in the minds of your countrymen
forever.

Hmm. I am glad of pleasant news
for a change.
They are interrupted by a knock at the door.

It should not, but cowardice such
as that surprises even me. Their

enough propriety to take his life
when shamed.
Kira rises and makes his way to the balcony overlooking the
bonsai garden below. Gazes out.
LORD KIRA (CONT’D)
A Lord is the spine of his people.
Do you see now what happens when
that spine is broken? When samurai
have no master? Disgraceful!

Marshall the troops.
MESSENGER
Which divisions, my lord?
LORD KIRA
All of them.

dogs they are.
MESSENGER
And the wedding, Lord?
LORD KIRA
What of it?
MESSENGER
In light of the danger, it’s been
suggested we postpone it.

97.
LORD KIRA
The only danger is to Lady Asano.
In their excitement, many accidents
have fallen on brides on their
wedding night.
(malicious)
The moment I wed her, I will become
a widower...and the true legal
ruler of Asano lands in more than
name only.
(grim beat)
No. The wedding goes on.
As the Messenger bows and exits, we PRELAP A MAN CRYING OUT
IN AGONY, and -HARD CUT TO:

Hold him down.
It’s Minoru. As they hold him, Minoru takes his sword from
the coals of a brazier. The blade GLOWS ORANGE with heat and
SIZZLES as he presses it to the wound.
The injured ronin shrieks...but when the sword is taken away,
the laceration has been CAUTERIZED.
Now WIDEN TO REVEAL the rest of the scene. It’s a horror
show of post-battle triage. BASHO having the arrows cut from
his back. OKUDA having his cheek stitched together from a
cut you can see his teeth through. ISOGAI grunting as thick
fingers pull a musketball from his shoulder. We are:

Where the ronin are licking their wounds from their narrow
escape.

Oishi watches the scene in despair.

Minoru enters and stands

MINORU
The soldiers have passed. We’ll be
safe for a few hours, but they’ll
be coming back.
It’s a quiet, tragic moment as they stare at the men.

Then --

OISHI
I have miscalculated. My pride has
brought us to this.
(beat)
Perhaps we should have acted the
night of Asano’s death. We were
vastly outnumbered, but at least we
would have died valiantly. With
honor. Now we are only ronin...
(beat)
...and we have failed our lord.
Minoru has never seen this side of Oishi, and it scares him a
little.
MINORU
What are you saying?
OISHI
We all go our separate ways.
Scatter to the wind.
We run?

MINORU

OISHI
We live. For as long as we can.
Maybe there will be another day.
The one advantage we had was the
element of total surprise, and it
is gone.
Is it?

MINORU

Oishi looks at him...and amazingly, the man is grinning.
MINORU
A great warrior once said, “If the
enemy thinks of the mountains,
attack like the sea; and if he
think of the sea, attack like the
mountains.”
Minoru turns then...and Oishi follows his gaze to the snowy
peaks looming above Kira’s fortress.
MINORU
They expect us to run.

Oishi slowly smiles at his own words coming back to him.

OISHI
Gather the men.
SLAM TO:
EXT. ABANDONED FARMHOUSE - NIGHT
As the MUSIC RISES, the 47 Ronin don the same formal attire
they wore when they first greeted the Shogun -- the
TRADITIONAL UNIFORM OF THE ASANO CLAN.
It is the first time they have worn the Asano CREST since
their disgrace. Etched in moonlight, they look like a battle
force stepped from myth.
Oishi looks them all over with pride.
OISHI
While the result may be uncertain,
by dawn they will know the courage
of the Asano Clan!
The men unleash a cheer that can be heard by the gods.
They’re ready.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. KIRA’S FORTRESS - FORMAL CHAMBER - NIGHT
The room is filled with a sea of colorfully-wrapped WEDDING
PRESENTS.
Mika sits among them, despondent. Hopeless. Reality setting
in. There is no getting out of this. This is her future.
Overcome by frustration, Mika hurls a table of gifts aside.
As the brightly-colored boxes cascade to the ground,
a kaiken -- or SMALL BRIDAL SWORD symbolically given for good
luck -- spills out of one of the packages.
Mika picks up the ceremonial blade, her hands begin to
tremble. Maybe there is a way out of this... Mika closes
her eyes and exhales, trying to calm herself -- then raises
the knife to her own jugular.
With the clock running down on the Shogun’s decree, Mika
gives in to hopelessness and steels herself for this last
statement of defiance against Kira. To die among their
wedding gifts.

100.
TEARS begin to run down her cheeks. And just as she cries
out and makes the move to slash her own throat -Mika’s eyes fall on something she recognizes among the sea of
presents. A gift wrapped in a swatch of silk BEARING HER
FAMILY CREST.
Mika gasps and drops the knife as she races to pick up the
package. Unwraps it the reveal a block of ivory delicately
carved into the shape of a single beautiful SAKURA BLOSSOM.
Mika begins to cry, but now in joy.
Minoru is here.

He is coming for her.

As hope grows in her eyes, filling her with renewed strength,
and Mika laughs for the first time in a year -SFX: CRUMP-CRUMP-CRUMP!
ROCK THE CASTLE!

SOUNDS OF SNOW-MUFFLED EXPLOSIONS

Startled, Mika races to the balcony, where a SLITHERING NOISE
begins to fill the air, GROWING LOUDER with every passing
second. Like a titanic snake sliding down the mountain.
INT. KIRA’S CHAMBERS - SAME TIME
Kira is asleep in his opulent bed...when a sound so deep and
powerful begins to VIBRATE the wall stones in their mortar.
Softly at first, but then violently enough to wake him in a
panic.
Kira races a window...where he sees a LINE OF TORCHES along a
path to the top of the mountain begin to WINK OUT as
something swallows them, one by one, descending toward the
castle.
LORD KIRA
What in hell --?
EXT. KIRA’S MOUNTAIN CASTLE - PARAPET WALK - CONTINUOUS
Kira’s GUARDS stand frozen atop the outer defensive wall,
staring out at the terrible darkness racing down the
mountain, heading straight for them. The noise is DEAFENING.
And as they watch in horror, the cause of the disturbance
blasts into the pool of light around the castle -A MILLION CUBIC FEET OF ICE roars down the mountain, right at
Kira’s castle! The avalanche speeds downward in a solid
mass, like a vengeful tectonic plate sliding downhill,
OBLITERATING everything in its path.
A YOUNG GUARD is paralyzed by the sight.

101.

Gods...

YOUNG GUARD

A shout Guard #1 jolts him back to motion.
PARAPET GUARD #1
THE ALARM, YOU FOOL! THE ALARM!
The Young Guard runs through the chaos of the walk to reach a
MASSIVE BELL in the tower. But just as he grabs the rope to
swing the log clapper -PARAPET GUARD #1 (CONT’D)
FIND COVER!! FIND CO-WHAAAAAAAMMMM! The entire castle SHUDDERS as the avalanche
COLLIDES into the wall and -WHOOOOOOOOOOSH!! The snow sweeps across the parapet walk
like the Wrath of God, sending everyone screaming into the
abyss.
IN THE ALARM TOWER ALONG THE REAR WALL
The Young Guard swings the clapper -- GONNGGGG! -- but the
sound is swallowed as the avalanche reaches the tower and -CRACKKK! -- tears the entire structure away from the wall
like the hand of frost giant child dissatisfied with his toy
castle.
The Young Guard screams as the tower shears from its
foundation and we TRACK WITH HIM as it tumbles all the way
down the cliff.
INT. CASTLE COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS
Kira’s elite samurai race from their barracks

They reach the breech in the wall, but can see nothing
through the thick clouds of swirling ice crystals.
Then SHAPES appear in the dense fog.
OCTOPUS SAMURAI #1 is the first to recognize the danger.
RONIN!

OCTOPUS SAMURAI #1

Oishi steps through the mist.

102.
The Octopus rushes him, but Oishi SIDESTEPS and grabs the
steel tentacles dangling from the Octopus’ helm. YANKS down,
exposing a gap beneath his chin, and thrusts his sword with
all his pent up rage -- SKEWERING straight through the
warrior’s brain AND the top of his ornate helm.
With a savage twist, Oishi splits the man’s face and helm and
WRENCHES his sword free.
Oishi stands there, chest heaving, splattered in blood...and
gives the WARCRY he’s been waiting to give since the night of
his master’s death.
OISHI
FOR LORD ASANO!
And the two armies race at one another to begin the greatest
swordfight in history: Oishi’s ronin against a thousand
elite samurai.
And as the entire castle’s defenses surge at the invaders -EXT. A QUIET SECTION OF THE PARAPET WALK - CASTLE FRONT
Now that the defenders are rushing toward the other side of
the castle, a half-dozen scaling hooks sail over this
abandoned section of perimeter wall and -- CLINK-CLINK! -latch on!
Moments later, OKUDA, HAZAMA, two other burly ronin and
CHIKARA clamber up to the walk.
DOWN BELOW
a DARK SHAPE stomps into the courtyard. The NINJA CLANLORD
surveys the battle -- and spots OKUDA and his force heading
for the CANNON atop the rampart wall.
The Clanlord grits his melted jaw so hard, we can hear the
muscles creak.
AT THE REAR OF THE CASTLE
In the midst of battle, Oishi looks up and sees Chikara and
the others racing across the wall...and below them, a SQUAD
OF NINJA spider-climbing the walls.
Oishi calls out, trying to warn his son -CHIKARA!

OISHI

-- but he can’t hear him over the din of battle.

103.
Then -- swish! --a sword swipe brings his focus back to the
battle.
POV OISHI - FORMULATING A BATTLE PLAN
As he did against the Brigands at the beginning of the film.
As Kira’s octopodian army closes in, Oishi MENTALLY DISSECTS
THE SCENE. From a WIDE ANGLE, we RACK IN on the courtyard’s
particular geographic features:
a three-foot thick INNER
GATE that prevents them from reaching the castle proper, the
MAZE OF OUTBUILDINGS on this side of that gate, the SLIGHT
RISE of a particular path weaving between them. Then on the
WEAPONS HIS OPPONENTS CARRY, noting in VFX their effective
lethal range and the most immediate threat -- a LINE OF
SPEARMEN charging them.
Faster than thought, Oishi has his plan and puts it into
action.
FORMATION!

OISHI

Instantly, the ronin form up in a particular configuration,
and as the enemy spearmen close in as a wave -KESA!

OISHI (CONT’D)

Oishi’s samurai react in unison, MIRRORING the training we
saw them practicing on bamboo targets at the start of the
film. The ANGLES and CAMERA SHOTS are identical, except this
time it’s not bamboo they chop, but their opponents’ SPEARS.
SCHUNK-SHUNKK-SCHUNKK! Forty of Kira’s spears are reaped
like wheat. Then -- SCHUNK-SHUNKK-SCHUNKK! -- so are the men
that hold them.
OISHI (CONT’D)
NORTH FRONT! MISU-GAESHI!
Koto blades flash diagonally up, CLEAVING through fresh ranks
of Kira’s spearmen, shattering their enemies’ arms and armor
with a quality of weapons and skill Kira’s fighters cannot
match.
Then Oishi charges forward, leading his men into the maze of
structures where the narrow walls reduce the advantage of
numbers Kira’s army has.
At a particular stretch -OISHI (CONT’D)
WE HOLD HERE UNTIL THEY GET THE
GATE OPEN!

104.
And as Kira’s army closes on both sides and the ronin defend
on two fronts: Oishi and the remaining ronin on the right
side, and Minoru almost single-handedly holding the left -ATOP THE WALL - OKUDA AND HIS FORCE
have almost reached the cannon...when the DREAD NINJA
CLANLORD and his minions mount the parapet walk between them
and it.
The HISS of them drawing their EXOTIC WEAPONS and adopting
their FIERCE READY STANCE freezes the blood in the ronin’s
veins.
As the Ninja move forward, Okuda’s men try their best to
engage them -- but are quickly beaten back, intimidated.
That’s when Okuda’s men break and BACK AWAY.
Chikara retreats with them...until he looks down and sees
Kira’s legions pushing the ronin back in the courtyard.
Closing in on his friends. On his father.
And when Oishi looks up at him and they meet eyes, resolve
floods back into Chikara veins.
CHIKARA
(stopping)
No! We can’t! If we don’t open
that gate, they die!
But none step forward.
Except Hazama.
HAZAMA
I’m with you, boy.
Alone, the oldest and the youngest of the ronin share a
look...then charge forward like tigers.
As Hazama engages several ninja, CHIKARA draws his sword and
charges the Clanlord. As he nears, he gives a powerful
kirioroshi downward cut -- but the Clanlord easily turns the
blade and delivers an arm crushing overhead chop.
CLAAAAANGGG!!
Chikara staggers under the force of the blow, and before he
can recover the Clanlord CHOPS again! And again.
CLAAAANGGG! CLAAAANGGG!!
DOWN BELOW
The sheer weight of numbers against them SQUEEZES Oishi’s
force closer and closer together like a vice.

105.
Bodies of the enemy pile up, but still they clamber over in
an endless tide.
Hanjo turns to Oishi.
HANJO
We can’t hold.
We must.

OISHI

ABOVE - CHIKARA
Chikara scrambles back beneath the Clanlord’s relentless
assault. The Assassin Lord strikes FASTER AND FASTER, and as
a mighty koshi giri cut bounds off his blade with the force
of a sledgehammer -- Chikara winces and reflexively SWITCHES
HIS SWORD FROM HIS RIGHT HAND TO HIS LEFT.
MATCH TO:
OISHI - DOWN BELOW

training.
No...

OISHI

THE NINJA CLANLORD’S
mouth twists into a half-melted smile, recognizing the
opening. And as he raises his blade for the final coup de
grace -That’s when Chikara STRIKES WITH A DAGGER THAT HAS BEEN
HIDDEN IN HIS RIGHT HAND, pulling off one of the maneuvers
Minoru taught him!
Like lightning, Chikara STABS the Clanlord in the leg,
causing the assassin’s death blow to swing wide.
And before the Ninja Clanlord can react, Chikara rises
up...and with his DOMINANT LEFT HAND, swings his blade and
SEVERS THE BASTARD’S HEAD FROM HIS SHOULDERS!
BELOW - ON THE VERGE OF BEING OVERWHELMED
Oishi watches with surprise and pride as his son KICKS the
legendary Clanlord from the wall.
There is a moment -- a perfect moment -- where Chikara and he
meet eyes.

106.
Then with a warcry, Oishi throws himself back into the fight
with renewed energy, driving Kira’s hordes back one last
time!
OISHI
HOUSE ASANO!!
BACK ATOP THE WALL
Seeing their leader tumble off the wall like a swath of
night, the remaining ninja show fear for the first time and
hesitate...and it is their undoing.
Okuda and the others race back, and it is only a matter of
moments before the ronin dispatch them in similar fashion.
Chikara and Hazama then lead the men to the CANNON and, using
all their strength, TURN IT to face the INNER GATE. IGNITE
the fuse and -KA-BOOOM! The cannon ball SMASHES a man-sized hole through
the gate and SHREDS the few defenders on the other side in a
BLAST OF SPLINTERS!
Instantly, the Hazama and Okuda reload the cannon from a pile
of ANTI-INFANTRY CHAIN SHOT stored nearby, reposition the
cannon and -- BOOOOM!
VFX: we FOLLOW the chain shot as it flies and CLEARS A BLOODY
PATH through Kira’s samurai from Oishi’s main force to the
BLAST HOLE in the inner gate.
OISHI
recognizes his chance and -OISHI
RONIN, TO ME!
-- CHARGES through the GORE PATH before the parted red sea
can crash back together.
Oishi and his ronin race across the courtyard and duck
through the blast hole in the gate -- then turn and plug the
gap with their swords.
Kira’s legions try to carve their way through, but the gap in
the heavy door only allows them through one at a time. The
result is a samurai blender -- Kira’s men rushing through
only to meet their bloody fates at the angry blades of the 47
ronin. Stalemate. Kira’s overwhelming strength of their
numbers has been temporarily neutralized.

107.
OISHI (CONT’D)
This is where we hold. There is no
further retreat.
(turns to look at castle)
Hanjo. Minoru. Isogai. With me.
And as they turn and stride for the castle -INT. FORMAL CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS
Mika sees the battle below.
MINORU!!

And more importantly --

MIKA

BACK TO SHOT
As they mount the keep steps, Minoru and Oishi hear her.
Look up to spot her in the fourth story window.
Minoru and she meet eyes, and there is a CONNECTION there
greater than all other forces in the universe.
Oishi recognizes it.
Find her.

Turns to him.
OISHI

Minoru nods, thankful, and races off into the castle.

God

INT. CASTLE - RECEPTION AREA - CONTINUOUS
A statue of a DEMON OCTOPUS dominates the room. Panicking
servants scream and scatter as Oishi, Hanjo and Isogai.
Oishi grabs a COOK as he races by.
OISHI
Where is your Lord?
The man babbles, so Oishi knocks him down and puts his sword
to his throat. The Cook points in the right direction.
But as Oishi begins to move that way -SIX WARRIORS race from the hall in full cephalopdian armor.
Hanjo and Isogai move as one to intercept the threat.
Go.

HANJO

108.
And Oishi does.
EXT. CASTLE - THE WAR AT THE INNER GATE - CONTINUOUS
The ronin struggle to hold back immense waves of warriors.
The bodies of Kira’s samurai are piling high. Blood churns
the ground to red mud.
Kira’s soldiers work as a unit try to push through en masse,
but Basho uses his inhuman strength to hold them back.
It’s questionable how long they can hold.
INT. CASTLE - STAIRS - CONTINUOUS
Minoru bounds the stairs three at a time. Kira’s samurai pop
from shadows -- and fall to the ground in a various
assortment of bloody, quivering parts.
Nothing is going to stop him.
MIKA?
HERE!!

MINORU
MIKA (OS)

And like a magnet drawn to true north, he exits the stairs
and reaches the room where Mika is held.
Mika?
Minoru!

MINORU
MIKA (OS)

He BASHES the lock, and when he pushes open the door Mika
flies into his arms. She’s been strong and brave for so long
-- a perfect samurai daughter -- but now that Minoru holds
her, the dam breaks and she allows herself to be human, and a
woman, and sobs.
Minoru just holds her.

Never going to let go.
CUT TO:

OISHI
moves through the castle on the hunt. Hysteria has set in
and swarms of servants run in every direction -- but like
magic, they all move out of Oishi’s way as he strides past.
Then, ahead, through the crowd, Oishi spots a flash of
pretentious silk.

109.

KIRA!!

OISHI

KIRA wheels and sees Oishi...and the Lord of the castle turns
and run in utter panic. Oishi charges forward like a lion
after prey.
INT. MIKA’S CHAMBER - SAME TIME
Minoru finally pulls away from Mika.
MINORU
We have to go.
Taking her hand, he leads her down the hall toward the
stairs...when someone strides out at the end of the hall,
blocking their path.
The LOVECRAFTIAN SAMURAI. Kira’s fiercest warrior. The
demon that bested Minoru in the competition at Asano’s
castle. The bastard that lead Mika’s father to her doom.
His voice is the basso of funeral drums.
LOVECRAFTIAN SAMURAI
I bested you before, halfbreed.
(beat)
Kneel and I shall make it quick.
Minoru gently pushes Mika back from what’s about to occur.
MINORU
But this time I fight for more than
honor.
The two square off. This is a battle that had to happen.
And this time it won’t cease at first blood.
This time we will get to see how it truly ends.
So be it.

LOVECRAFTIAN SAMURAI

And with slashing swords and steel tentacles, the Gods of War
explode into combat!
SMASH TO:
EXT. CASTLE - PARAPET WALK
Chikara watches as a massive division of Kira’s men split
away from the group assaulting the gate -- and begin racing
up the rampart steps.

110.
CHIKARA
They’re after the cannon!
HAZAMA
If they get it, they’ll breech the
gate.
CHIKARA
(to Okuda and the others)
Hold them back!
And as Okuda’s force races to meet the octopus-armored
samurai, Chikara and Hazama position the cannon at the
rampart stairs and -- BOOOOM!
Samurai bodies fly and fall as the stairs collapse.
Then Chikara and Hazama charge into the fray.
INT. CASTLE - CORRIDOR MAZE - SAME TIME
Oishi is following Kira’s terrified flutter of silk through
the labyrinth of hardwood corridors, gaining, when -AUGHH!

OISHI

-- a yari SPEAR flashes out through a hole in the wall and
IMPALES him through the shoulder.
Then -- SHUNKK! Another spear flashes out from a hole in the
opposite wall and LANCES him through the leg.
With a yell, Oishi then SLASHES DOWN then UP, freeing himself
by severing the spears that pins him.
Now, Oishi turns and looks about him...
...and sees 200 other SPEAR HOLES lining the walls.
led him into a trap -- a HALL OF DEATH.

Kira has

At the end of the hall, Kira watches smugly as Oishi realizes
his predicament.
But Oishi is samurai...and doesn’t fear death.
Samurai training pulsing through him like a live wire, Oishi
continues to move toward Kira. Cautiously. Listening...
And the second he hears wood sliding on wood -Oishi turns performing a whirlwind cut known as Sparrows
Flying and -- SHUNKK! SHUNKK-SHUNKK!! -- HACKS DOWN three
more spears darting out at him!

111.
As the speartips clatter to the floor, Oishi meets Kira’s
eyes...and smiles.
Kira’s face falls. And Oishi CHARGES. SHUNK-SHUNK-SHUNKSHUNK! Waves of spears flash out, but Oishi’s sword whips
around him at blinding speed, his amazing bladework turning
the hallway into an EXPLOSION OF SPLINTERS as he races
through to the end and after Kira.
INT. CASTLE - OUTSIDE MIKA’S CHAMBERS - SAME TIME
Mika watches in horror as Minoru and the Lovecraftian Samurai
hack and slash at each other in the mother of all battles.
Minoru’s sword versus the demon fighter’s blade and whipping
tentacles.
The fight is a blur, but like their previous fight in the
arena, we again watch helpless as the TIDE SLOWLY TURNS
against Minoru.
The Lovecraftian Samurai repeatedly WHIPS OUT his heavy steel
dreadlocks to trap Minoru’s sword and strike down into his
shoulder. His back. His arm.
But the worst happens when Minoru goes to defend a lightning
fast attack -- that the Lovecraftian Samurai suddenly
REVERSES, COMPLETELY SEVERING Minoru’s little and ring
fingers from his right hand!
GAAAAGHH!

MINORU

The koto blade falls from Minoru’s grasp to clatter to the
floor. And in that instant, the Lovecraftian warrior SLINGS
his head around and LASHES his tentacles around Minoru’s
throat, YANKS the ronin close and -No!

MIKA

-- STABS Minoru COMPLETELY THROUGH HIS CHEST!
Mika screams as she sees the bloody blade EXPLODE from
Minoru’s back.
The demon samurai yanks the blade out, then HURLS Minoru to
the ground like trash. Stomps on his chest and readies his
blade for the final, life-ending thrust.
Minoru lays there gasping, all the fight bleeding out of him
onto the floor with his life’s blood.
LOVECRAFTIAN SAMURAI
Your father should have done this
the moment you came out of the
womb, halfbreed whelp.

And just as the Lovecraftian Samurai pulls back to strike -We see Mika RISE behind him, Minoru’s sword held high!
righteous fire, she CHOPS DOWN!

With

VFX - SLOW MOTION: But as the sword nears, the samurai
SENSES the threat and wheels around, the blow missing him by
the width of a strand of silk.
The sword clangs off the ground, and the demon samurai
SMASHES MIKA DOWN with a vicious steel-gauntleted backhand.
Mika crumples to the ground, and seeing that -MINORU’S
-- switch is flipped. With a cry of rage, he rises from the
dead, ignoring the pain to snatch up his sword and throw
himself into one final all-consuming attack.
The Lovecraftian Samurai tries to counter with his tentacles
-- but Minoru SEVERS THEM WITH A SINGLE MIGHTY BLOW!
The samurai staggers back in shock, unbelieving, severed
tentacles clinking to the floor around him.
And that’s when Minoru finishes it. Sword whirling like a
helicopter blade, Minoru VIVISECTS THE BASTARD INTO NEAT
LITTLE SIX-INCH HORIZONTAL SLICES FROM HEAD TO FOOT!
Mika stares until Minoru turns her away from the gruesome
sight.
Let’s go.

MINORU

And as he leads her away, HARD CUT TO:
EXT. CASTLE - THE WAR AT THE INNER GATE
The ronin still hold the portal...but they’re taking ghastly
injuries and -SFX:

THE SPLINTERING OF WOOD!

Under the weight of the onslaught, the gate is beginning to
FRACTURE, while -INT. CASTLE - CORRIDORS - SAME TIME
Oishi ignores his injuries and TRACKS Kira to:

113.
THE WOMEN’S APARTMENTS
Leaving a trail of blood behind him, Oishi enters...and SPIES
Kira hiding among the women and children.
Oishi strides to him like a wraith of vengeance. Grabs the
coward by the collar of his robes and drags him across the
room.
Kira scrabbles at the floor as Oishi drags him away.
No!

LORD KIRA
Please--! NOOOOOO!!

Oishi dumps him in the center of the room.
LORD KIRA (CONT’D)
I beg of you! I beg of you--!
Oishi’s response is a lump of metal dropped at his feet.
KNIFE Asano committed seppuku with.

Oishi’s voice is a study in calm and control.
OISHI
You recognize it.
It’s not a question.
LORD KIRA

He

OISHI
And you have violated the honor of
your House.
(slides the knife closer)
Redeem it.
Kira looks at the knife...and begins to cry. His tears ruin
his perfect powder-whitened face. His blackened teeth. His
regal robes.
It’s pathetic.
LORD KIRA
Have you no mercy?
Oishi’s cold, hard stare says it all -- no.
Eventually, with a trembling hand, Kira picks up the knife.
Sniffs and wipes his eyes with the sleeves of his robe.
LORD KIRA (CONT’D)
You will tell them I died with
honor?

114.
OISHI
I will tell them the truth.
Kira nods.

Readies himself.

Exhales and --

SCRAMBLES backwards to grab a CHILD as shield, placing the
dagger to the young girl’s throat. Kira shrieks at Oishi in
a shrill, panicky voice.
LORD KIRA
You get away from me or I will kill
this girl!
But Oishi isn’t buying into it. Like a machine, he steps
forward and gives Kira a resounding open-handed SLAP across
the face. Then again.
It’s not a beating for a man.
As Kira sits stunned by the insult, the little girl runs
away.
Oishi then seizes Kira’s knife hand in an iron-hard grip.
OISHI
Coward... Know now the depth of my
Lord’s bravery and honor.
And with that, Oishi forces Kira’s hands to slit his own
belly, committing SEPPUKU.
Kira’s eyes widen in shock and pain ...and something else.
As Oishi forces the tyrant to cut himself open, Kira looks
down and NOTICES Lord Asano’s FAMILY CREST on the sleeves of
Oishi’s robes: two HAWK FEATHERS, crossed over one another.
LORD KIRA
...two feathers....
And with horrific realization, the twins’ prophesy comes
clear in Kira’s mind. Kira tries to laugh, but grunts in
agony instead.
And dies.
CUT TO:
EXT. CASTLE - THE WAR AT THE INNER GATE
The legions of Kira’s samurai make a final massive surge and
the gate GIVES WAY! The ronin back away as the nightmare
army FLOODS THROUGH. There is no hope now.
The octopus-legions unleash a BLOOD-THIRSTY VICTORY CRY, and
as they CHARGE forward to utterly obliterate the ronin --

Mysteriously, Kira’s warriors SLOW. Then STOP.

Staring in a

The ronin are confused by the sudden cease in battle, then
realize the warriors are not staring at them, but behind them
at:
OISHI
who steps out of the castle...KIRA’S HEAD held by its hair in
Oishi’s right hand.
And, unknowingly fulfilling the prophesy, Oishi raises the
head of the vanquished despot for all to see -- the “two
feathers” of Asano’s crest on his sleeve “lifting Kira up to
live in the minds of his countrymen forever”.
Utter stillness and silence descend on the castle.
It’s a moment frozen in time, Oishi standing there...
But this ultimate act of loyalty, of bravery, of bushido,
resonates with Kira’s defense force...and one by one, they
drop to their knees.
And PROSTRATE themselves before the 47 ronin.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. KIRA’S MOUNTAIN CASTLE - MINUTES LATER
The stronghold’s monstrous front gates groan apart, and the
47 ronin walk out. Though none of them have died, most bear
mortal or nearly mortal wounds that they will soon succumb
to.
But there is one final job to do first.
So huddling together, helping each other, Oishi’s exhausted,
injured, ragtag band of fighters exit the fortress all of
them were certain they would never escape alive.
Behind them, the entire castle remains kowtowed in reverence.
And as the music RISES, it sweeps us into a MONTAGE of:
THEIR JOURNEY HOME
-- The ronin descending the mountain. Oishi walks in the
lead, Kira’s head dangling from his hand like a lantern of
truth.

116.
-- Reaching the foothills, they pass a farmer turning his
field. The man stops dumbfounded when he sees the head.
Bows. Then races away to tell the village the tale.
-- Word travels quickly, and the inhabitants of Kira’s
village are all waiting when the ronin crest the rise. The
peasants approach Oishi’s men as they pass. The men mutter
words of thanks. The women openly weep. The children touch
these new heroes in awe.
Even the warrior monks in their blood-red robes bow in
reverence as the ronin pass.
-- And so it goes, all the way across the countryside.
Moved by their tale, villagers line the roads in greater and
greater numbers to watch Oishi and his men pass. Giving them
offerings of food. Water. Helping them walk.
-- Chikara stumbles, and a hand reaches out to lift him up.
It is the FRUIT VENDOR and his DAUGHTER who scolded him in
Edo. They help him up, then bow down in reverence. This
gesture of respect gives Chikara the strength to continue on.
-- When they reach Ako, they are surrounded by familiar
faces. Shamed faces. The BURLY VENDOR who spit on Oishi
beseeches him for forgiveness.
BURLY VENDOR
I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. I didn’t
know... How could I know?
Others appeal to Hazama, Basho, Isogai for having thought
them honorless.
Oishi’s wife, too, is in the crowd.
Chikara meet eyes.

She and Oishi and

But the 47 ronin do not stop, and do not reach the end of
their pilgrimage until they arrive at:
EXT. SENGAKUJI TEMPLE - DAWN
The gravesite of Lord Asano...
As they enter the sacred place, Mika goes to Hisae, who hugs
her tight as her mother would. And as Mika begins to weep
with weariness and relief, PAN AROUND to watch the ronin
doing what they have literally moved mountains to do.
Oishi reverently washes Kira’s in the cool water from the
temple well. Then places the tyrant’s head and the dagger
with which Asano and Kira both took their lives atop his
master’s grave.

OISHI
Rest now, my lord.

You are

As if in response, a wind soughs through the ancient trees,
bringing warmth. Peace. And -SFX:

THE SOUND OF HOOFBEATS.

HORSES.

LOTS OF THEM.

Oishi and the ronin turn to the staggering sight of SHOGUN
TOKUGAWA TSUNAYOSHI atop an WARHORSE of mythical proportions.
He is backed by the Shogun’s ARMORED CAVALRY -- two hundred
horses the size of tanks, encased in spiked and bladed steel.
There will be no escape from this place.
The Shogun’s pinch-faced ADJUTANT steps forward.
SHOGUN’S ADJUTANT
Oishi Kuranosuke!!
Oishi rises calmly and regards the man.
SHOGUN’S ADJUTANT
You and your men stand accused of
treason and the butchery of the
Shogun’s envoy and Master of
Protocol, Lord Kira Yoshinaka.
OISHI
It was not butchery, my Lord.
SHOGUN’S ADJUTANT
Is that not his head there!
OISHI
No... What lays atop that grave is
Justice.
SHOGUN’S ADJUTANT
He was your superior!
OISHI
He was corrupt.
(beat)
My men and I followed the Code of
bushido and honored our master by
avenging Lord Kira’s treachery.
The Code demanded it. Justice
demanded it. We could do nothing
else.
A murmur rolls through the crowd. Agreement. The Adjutant
senses the support of the crowd. Doesn’t like it.

118.
SHOGUN’S ADJUTANT
And in doing so, you defied a
direct command from the Shogun
forbidding you from exacting
revenge!
OISHI
(nods)
This is so.
SHOGUN’S ADJUTANT
The penalty is Death.
(turns to his men)
Cut these criminals down.
But instantly the crowd PROTESTS, surging forward, placing
themselves between the soldiers and Oishi’s men, shouting to
forestall the sentence.
The Adjutant is taken aback by the reaction.
are taken aback.

The soldiers

The Shogun watches impassively from atop his horse.
With kindness and thanks, Oishi and his men gently extract
themselves from the safety of the villagers...and step
forward to meet their fate.
The Adjutant knows this is his chance.
Kill them.

Turns to his men.

SHOGUN’S ADJUTANT

But now even the soldiers hesitate, unwilling to mow down
such courage and honor. Such utter exemplification of the
bushido code.
The Adjutant loses it.
SHOGUN’S ADJUTANT
I GAVE YOU AN ORDER! BY THE GODS,
YOU WILL DO AS I COMMAND OR I WILL
SEE YOU ALL HANGED -And just as the situation is about to spin out of control -Stop.

SHOGUN

The Shogun’s voice is the deep basso rumble of the Word of
God, cutting through all existence. In the instant silence,
the Adjutant goes prone. The soldiers and the crowd stand
terrified.
The Shogun steps off his horse like a deity of war descending
to earth and strides toward Oishi.

As he nears, Oishi draws his sword -- and, instantly, fifty
ashigaru infantrymen spring forward drawing their own blades!
But all for naught.

OISHI
Never was that my intention.
SHOGUN
And yet the result is the same.
(beat)
You are criminals. You defied my
order, for which I need to make a
harsh example of you -- but you
exemplified bushido in a time that
has forgotten the meaning of the
word. And the reason for it.
(beat)
That must be honored and never
forgotten.
Oishi considers the Shogun’s words.

Then:

OISHI
We acted, knowing the penalty was
death. We are samurai and accepted
that. And as samurai, we must meet
our punishment. To excuse us of
this duty would steal the honor
from all we have done...and make us
ronin in a way Lord Kira never
could.
(beat)
This is our fate. We have accepted
it. Strike us down.
SHOGUN
The country would never forgive me
for shaming you so...and I could
never forgive myself.
OISHI
Then let it be our choice. Allow
us the honor of a samurai death, to
die as our Lord and be buried at
his side.

Heart heavy with regret, the Shogun acknowledges the wisdom -and the right -- of this.
SHOGUN
I will grant you an honorable
death...under one condition:
(as Oishi looks to him)
That your bloodline continues,
Oishi Kuranosuke. Your son shall
live so that the heritage of such
an honorable man will not be
thinned from Japan’s future.
Oishi is moved by the gesture.

INT. SENGAKUJI TEMPLE - A SMALL SHOJI SCREEN ROOM - LATER
Hisae helps her husband into the pristine white robes in
preparation for his seppuku.
She’s fussing with tying the obi knot just so and getting
increasingly frustrated -- when she simply drops her hands
and begins to cry.
Oishi holds her tenderly.

And he kisses her.

Tragically.

Passionately.

Perfectly.

When they part, Oishi turns to see Chikara standing at the
door struggling to hold the stoicism of a samurai to make his
father proud, yet betrayed by the tears rising in his eyes.
No words are needed here. Oishi moves to him and wraps him
into a fierce father’s hug.
And as the tears begin to fall, Oishi holds him tight and
whispers into his ear.
OISHI
I am so proud of you, Chikara.

So

Then pulls back and looks into his eyes.
OISHI
I know you will carry on the family
name with honor.
CHIKARA
I love you, father.

OISHI
(hugs him again)
We will meet again along the Path.
Do you understand?
Chikara nods.
INT. SENGAKUJI TEMPLE - HALL
The ronin exit their preparation rooms and enter the hall.
The sight of so many white robes is disconcerting. Ghosts
haunting a hall. As -MINORU
-- steps out, Mika rushes to him, tears running down her
face.
In front of everyone, defying tradition and prejudice, she
hugs and kisses him. For in this moment, nothing else
matters...save for the words she needs him to hear.
MIKA
You will live in my heart forever.
From the corner of the room, a SOLDIER speaks.
SOLDIER
It is time.
The men line up. Oishi steps from his room with one last
look at his wife and son, takes his place at the head of the
line and begins to leading his men outside.
One by one they pass through the temple portal, but as Minoru
reaches the threshold:
You.

SHOGUN

The line stopped. Minoru steps out of line to stand before
the towering military giant.
The moment is reminiscent of when the Shogun called him out
at the combat challenge in Ako.
The Shogun considers Minoru for a moment.
His stern face inscrutable. Then --

He says nothing.

SHOGUN
I remember your father. He served
by my side. He was a great
warrior.

SHOGUN (CONT'D)
As is his son. You honor the
family name...samurai.
And to Minoru’s utter astonishment, the Shogun BOWS to him.
No longer a halfbreed in his eyes...but a samurai.
Minoru is moved as nothing else on earth could possibly do.
EXT. SENGAKUJI TEMPLE - MAGIC HOUR
Oishi’s SAMURAI (no longer ronin) walk out to the temple
steps and sit seiza.
The scene is epic. 46 white-robed figures kneeling at the
foot of the immense temple steps. A crowd gathered around
them. Soldiers. The Shogun presiding over all.
And as the music swells, capturing the poignancy of the
moment -- the tragedy and the honor; the faces of the
villagers and their loved ones watching on -- the samurai
draw their daggers.
They hold for a moment, daggers before them -- and that is
how we will remember them, for, as they thrust, we PAN UP to

A TITLE CARD rises:

As a result of the actions of the 47 Ronin,
Kira’s lands were dispossessed and the
province of Ako returned to House Asano by
order of the Shogunate.
Oishi’s son, Chikara lived a long life,
bearing three sons and a daughter. At his
death, at the age of 78, he was buried
alongside his father and his comrades at Lord
Asano’s tomb as the 47th ronin.
To this day, every December 14th – the
anniversary of the attack on Lord Kira’s
stronghold – thousands of people across Japan,
and the world, still gather at Sengakuji
Temple to pay tribute to the 47 ronin and
their example of bravery, loyalty and
unfaltering honor.
This film is dedicated to the memory of the 47
Ronin:
