The Grand Inquisitor:
“’Better that you enslave us, but feed us.’ They will finally
understand that freedom and earthly bread in plenty for everyone
are inconceivable together, for never, never will they be able to
share amongst themselves.”
- FYODOR DOSTOEVSKY, The Brothers Karamazov

I/E. EVICTION HOME - DAY
A blood-stained wall near family photos. POLICEMEN take flash
photos of the DEAD HOMEOWNER, gun in his lifeless hand.
OFFICER
get the
talking
broker,

DUDURA questions two SHERIFFS (30s-50s) but tries to
attention of an impeccably dressed RICK CARVER (40s),
on the phone. He’s a smart, ambitious real estate
with a mean-streak.
OFFICER DUDURA
Rick?... Mr. Carver?...
RICK CARVER
I’ll be with you in a second.

He continues his call; wants to look away from the dead
homeowner, but can’t.
RICK CARVER (INTO PHONE)
Remove the power meter, turn off
their water, and let ‘em sweat a
couple days, then ride up on your
white fucking horse and tell them
you have an interested cash-buyer
and that Rick Carver can get the
short-sale approved... Jesus, do I
have to hold your hand while you
give them a hand job, Bill? Get me
that property.
He smokes an electronic cigarette.
RICK CARVER
Yes, John - Officer Dudura - you
have my court order signed by the
Judge. What else can I do for you?
OFFICER DUDURA
You’re the bank’s realtor for the
eviction today. I need an official
statement. What happened? Why?
Rick walks though the house; Dudura and Sheriffs follow.
RICK CARVER
Well, Dudura, it’s a real shame,
because we arrived here with two
pizzas for Mr. Kadwell, the
property owner, but he didn’t want
the anchovies, so he went into the
house, pulled out a gun, and blew
his brains out.

2.

OUTSIDE THE HOME
NEIGHBORS have gathered. POLICEMEN, EMTs, NEWS TEAMS. A
POLICEWOMAN and NEIGHBOR console a sobbing WIFE and two KIDS.
RICK CARVER
(points to crying Wife)
That set off Mrs. Kadwell, who was
expecting Chinese for dinner.
Dudura looks disgusted; Sheriff #1 snickers.
OFFICER DUDURA
You’re talking about someone who
just killed himself.
RICK CARVER
I’m the last man who knocked on
Patrick Kadwell’s door - in his
life. That’s his wife of twelve
years, Samantha, and son, Dylan eight - and daughter, Paige eleven. What official statement is
going to encapsulate the tragic
absurdity of this fucked up
situation, Dudura? I can’t bring
him back to life, so please stop
wasting my time.
He walks away and answers his RINGING phone.
RICK CARVER (INTO PHONE)
This is Rick Carver... I’m fine,
Dear... Turn the TV off and keep
the girls away from the internet...
I’ve got the other line. - This is
Rick Carver...
Keyless entry and he gets into INT. RICK'S LEXUS LX - CONTINUOUS
- the high-end, high-tech, luxury Lexus LX SUV.
RICK CARVER
Ride it up to $200,000, $220 cap...
no more than 10% down, 7.5% makes
me sing. And get the Miguels ready.
It’s 2 grand a month on interest
alone. I want to flip this finger.
Get back to me. - Call office.
On-Board system DIALS. The two Sheriffs knock on his window.

3.

SHERIFF #1
Anything else, boss?
RICK CARVER
Next eviction’s Tuesday. Natalia’ll
call you.
They leave. He scrolls emails on an iPad secured to his dash.
NATALIA (THROUGH SPEAKERS)
Rick Carver Realty.
RICK CARVER
Talk to me. My world’s upside-down.
NATALIA (THROUGH SPEAKERS)
I’m emailing your revised
itinerary... Also, um, Jerry from
Toyota Credit called again RICK CARVER
- Jerry’s full of shit. Keep
talking.
NATALIA (THROUGH SPEAKERS)
The high rise came through, PUDs
and all. What do you want me to
tell them?
Suddenly hears SHRIEKING. He looks out the window:
Police hold back the SHRIEKING Wife as EMTs push her Dead
Husband on a gurney and load him into a waiting ambulance.
EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE / MCMANSION SUBDIVISION - DAY
DENNIS NASH (29, blue collar, smart) and DENNIS’ CREW (2
Guys) put up a mansion.
Dennis chalks lines based on blueprints. Uses a power saw to
cut wood. Hot, he’s sweating; tats on his arms.
Dennis puts up the frame. Walking on wood beams way up high.
LATER
ELLIOTT, the GC (30s-50s) argues with Crew Leader who stops
Dennis and Crew.
CREW LEADER
Stop working! That’s it. Stop! The
buyer doesn’t qualify, the lender’s
out, we’re done.

4.

DENNIS
What does that mean in terms of
payment?
CREW LEADER
It means we’ve been working for
free. All this from roof to cement
is for nothing. Hey, no more
dinero! Stop! Let’s go home.
INT. COURT / GLOBE AREA - CONTINUOUS
CONNOR (9, smart, inquisitive, stubborn) and FRANK’S SON (9)
look at Australia on a large globe.
FRANK GREENE (30s-40s, blue collar, smart, humble) FRANK’S
WIFE and FRANK’S SON #2 (5) nearby. Dennis is on the phone.
DENNIS
Connor. What’re you doing? We’re
gonna be late. Come on.
Connor shrugs and says goodbye to Frank’s son.
DENNIS
Who’s that?
CONNOR
We’re in the same school.
A paper falls from Dennis’ folder. Connor picks it up and
hands it to his dad.
INT. COURT; COURTROOM - DAY
The Bailiff tries to keep order in the chaotic courtroom of
confused HOMEOWNERS and gossiping LAWYERS.
Connor watches Dennis defending himself against the FREEMAN
LAWYER. A JUDGE (50s-70s) presides.
FREEMAN LAWYER
Your Honor, he missed three
payments and is underwater over $80
grand. The bank could have a buyer
in place within 30 days.
JUDGE
Did you fail to make three
payments, Mr. Nash?

5.

DENNIS
Yes, sir - but I was told to, it
was two departments of the same
bank telling me the opposite thing
and then just recently I got this
final notice for eviction FREEMAN LAWYER
Your Honor, you already entered
summary judgement here. We’d like
to close by the end of the month.
JUDGE
I see no reason to hold up the sale
DENNIS
Hold on a minute - they told me not
to pay, that’s why I’m behind, they
told me - it was two departments of
the same bank, telling me different
things your Honor.
JUDGE
While I’m sympathetic to your
situation, I have 40,000 cases like
this backed up behind yours. Final
judgement granted. I’m ordered you
to vacate the premises.
DENNIS
That’s my family home, your Honor.
I was born and raised in that home.
So was my son, Connor. Please don’t
do this. We’ve lived there our
whole lives, my mom runs her
business out of that home. That’s
our second source of income.
JUDGE
This is your son?
DENNIS
Yes, that’s my son.
JUDGE
Then he should be in school, not
here.
DENNIS
He’s gonna lose his school with all
due respect your Honor, if we lose
our home.

6.

JUDGE
Sun Trust versus Cunningham.
DENNIS
Give me a bit more time your honor.
JUDGE
Bailiff, please remove Mr. Nash.
DENNIS
Your honor, I just need a bit more
time. Excuse me, I just need a bit
more time.
JUDGE
You have 30 days to file an appeal
like everyone else. Bailiff please
remove Mr. Nash.
Connor watches the Bailiff move Dennis aside as the next
HOMEOWNER awkwardly takes Dennis’ place.
INT. DENNIS’ TRUCK [MOVING] - DAY
Dennis smokes and drives; Connor near him. They’ve lost.
CONNOR
Where’re we going to stay if we
lose the home?
DENNIS
We’re not losing the home, bud.
CONNOR
How do you know? The cops aren’t
coming back? I just wanna know how
you’re gonna pay for it.
DENNIS
Connor! - I’m gonna figure it out.
That judge gave us 30 days. No
one’s taking the home from us.
EXT. DENNIS’ HOME / NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY
Dennis’ middle-class home. DEREK and KIDS ride bikes and play
in the street. Dennis pulls up.
CONNOR
Yo, Derek!

7.

He runs off to play with Derek. Dennis checks the mail; waves
to a NEIGHBOR. Connor rides bikes.
DENNIS
You be careful, Connor!
INT. DENNIS’ HOME - CONTINUOUS
His mom, LYNN cuts her CLIENT’s hair. Lynn is a hairdresser
who loves her family; she’s social, moody, loving, a little
lost since her husband died.
LYNN
So, tell me everything - did they
give you a lawyer, did they - ?
DENNIS
It’s the same story with the bank
guys, it’s the same story
everywhere we go.
LYNN
(to her client)
We have to find a lawyer, you know He goes to the living room and shuffles through piles of
bills, notes, bank paperwork.
(Their home is cluttered, lived-in; the decor belongs to his
parents. Family photos line the wall, including Dennis’ dad.
The family has lived here over 40 years. It feels like it.)
DENNIS
I’m just trying to figure out what
this 30-day thing means; he said
we’ve got 30 days to file an
appeal, but does that mean the
eviction’s not happening tomorrow?
LYNN
But the judge told you 30 days.
DENNIS
I know, the judge said we got 30
days to file for an appeal LYNN
Well he’s a judge, not a bartender!
We’re in good shape.

8.

INT. DENNIS’ HOME / KITCHEN & LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
In the living room: Dennis sits at a table with a mountain of
bills and an eviction notice. Quick series of phone call:
DENNIS (INTO PHONE)
My name is Dennis Nash, I’m calling
looking for representation. I
understand that you guys sometimes
do not need a retainer?
LATER
DENNIS (INTO PHONE)
When you went through what you went
through, you were able to find
someone pro bono - I’m just
wondering if he can help?
LATER: In the kitchen, Lynn brings dinner to Connor who
studies. A loving bond between them.
CONNOR
Lost is to found as outside is to
indoors, inside LYNN
And what’s another example?
CONNOR
Black and white?
LYNN
(gives him a plate)
Black and white? What’s another
one? Give me one more.
LATER: In the living room, Dennis looks exhausted.
DENNIS
454-0189. Please give us a call
back.
Dennis puts down the phone, exhausted, losing hope - but he
stretches and reenergizes himself for more calls.
EXT. DENNIS’ HOME - NIGHT
Lynn smokes. Dennis enters. They share a cigarette.
DENNIS
Sometimes, I don’t know what to say
to Connor.

9.

LYNN
I was so young when I had you, you
had to raise me.... you’ll know
what to say.
INT. DENNIS’ HOME; CONNOR’S ROOM - NIGHT
Connor lies asleep in bed. Dennis watches him from the
hallway. He turns off the light.
EXT. DENNIS’ HOME - MORNING
MEN gather on the lawn: Sheriffs (from opening scene), a
LOCKSMITH, JEFF (redneck) and his CLEAN-OUT-CREW (4 low-class
guys) near a van and truck.
Rick Carver pulls up.
INT./EXT. RICK’S RANGE ROVER / DENNIS’ HOME - CONTINUOUS
Rick speaks into “on board;” he props his foot up - AN ANKLE
HOLSTER WITH A GUN. Checks his Ruger, puts it back.
RICK CARVER
Borrow against Blair Street to
cover Via Alizar. I’ll flip that
this quarter.
NATALIA (THROUGH SPEAKERS)
Good. And Landon at code
enforcement?
RICK CARVER
I have a short sale for that
cocksucker. I’ll email the details.
NATALIA (THROUGH SPEAKERS)
Got it.
SHERIFF #1
Afternoon, boss. Love the new ride.
RICK CARVER
Range Rover HSE.
SHERIFF #1
Is this the Nash eviction?
RICK CARVER
Yeah, anyone home?

10.

SHERIFF #1
I’m not sure, but their vehicle’s
home.
RICK CARVER
Alright, let’s get to it.
They approach Dennis’ door. Sherriff #1 knocks.
Dennis looks out the window. They see him.
SHERIFF #1
He’s at the window.
Rick looks over. He and Dennis lock eyes for the first time.
INT. DENNIS’ HOME - CONTINUOUS
Dennis hesitates, Sheriff knocking. Doesn’t know what to do.
He looks in the next room, sees Lynn.
LYNN
What is it?
DENNIS
Sheriffs are here.
LYNN
Why are they here?
Knocking LOUDER. They go to the door.
Dennis opens the front door as the two large Sheriffs step
forward. Lynn stands next to Dennis.
SHERIFF #1
Good afternoon. I’m Deputy Anderson
with the Sheriffs department and
we’re here to serve you a courtordered eviction.
DENNIS
No. I think there’s a mistake. We
have SHERIFF #1
Sir, ma’am, do either of you have
weapons on your body or in the
property?
LYNN
No no no, not us.

11.

SHERIFF #1
Mr. Carver!
Dennis watches Rick come forward.
RICK CARVER
Good morning, sir. Ma’am. I’m Rick
Carver, a real estate broker, and
I’m sorry to say this home has been
foreclosed on and officially
transferred to the bank. I’ll need
you to please vacate the property.
DENNIS
Nobody’s “vacating” the home. I was
in court yesterday, and the Judge
informed me I have thirty days to
file an appeal and that’s what I’m
going to do.
RICK CARVER
Please show me you’ve posted bond
and have an emergency stay signed
by a judge, and you’re welcome to
remain here.
DENNIS
I got a question, you guys didn’t
get any rescheduling of the RICK CARVER
(shows paper)
This is a court order signed by a
judge dated today for you to leave
this property.
LYNN
Excuse me, Rick?
DENNIS
Mom.
RICK CARVER
My office offered you a $3,500 cashfor-keys settlement from the bank
to leave last month, but you
refused.
DENNIS
Yes, we refused.
LYNN
Well, we didn’t refuse, we tried to
save our house -

12.

RICK CARVER
I appreciate this is a difficult
situation, but the time has come,
you have to leave the property. You
are trespassing right now, you are
breaking the law.
LYNN
Sir, this is our home, so, we just
need a few minutes Rick motions to Sheriff #1, who steps forward. Rick walks
away and puts his sunglasses on.
SHERIFF #1
Sir, you and your mom need to step
foot out of the home now.
DENNIS
No. We’re not going to do that.
Just give us 24 hours LYNN
You all can come back, same time,
and if we don’t have the papers, we
don’t have the proof, then we will
leave.
DENNIS
We have a lawyer, we have it all
figured out.
Lynn tries to close the door.
LYNN
We need a day.
SHERIFF #1
Ma’am, do NOT close the door.
LYNN
We need a day.
SHERIFF #1
Here’s what I can do. You have two
minutes to gather whatever personal
items you need - cash, checkbooks,
medicines - and then DENNIS
No, this isn’t happening.
SHERIFF #1
Yes, this is happening.

13.

DENNIS
No, this isn’t happening.
LYNN
I’m going to call the lawyer.
SHERIFF #2
Ma’am! Excuse me.
Sheriff #2 moves past Dennis, entering the home.
DENNIS
Excuse me, please don’t come into
my house.
SHERIFF #1
There are two ways that we can do
this. The easy way, where you do
what you’re told. Or the hard way,
where I take you and your mom to
jail. Do you want your mom to go to
jail? What I’d like you to do, take
advantage of the two minutes Dennis notices Rick standing inside his house.
DENNIS
Sir, would you mind stepping
outside of the property?
RICK CARVER
This isn’t your home, son.
DENNIS
Mr. Carver?
Rick ignores him and walks into the house. The Sheriff lists
off statues of the law.
LYNN
Sir, we have the right to an
attorney. Just because somebody
forgot to call you, we don’t get a
lawyer?
RICK CARVER
It’s better not to get emotional
right now ma’am.
DENNIS
You’re kicking us out of our home!
LYNN
PLEASE, okay, please!

14.

SHERIFF #1
Enough of this, let’s go.
Dennis calms his screaming mom and relents. They start
packing up.
SHERIFF #1
Get what you need to get and let’s
go.
LYNN’S BEDROOM
Sheriff #2 watches Lynn grab her jewelry, checkbook,
medicines.
LYNN
Sir, I don’t need your help, ok? Do
you need to follow a woman into her
bedroom?
SHERIFF #2
It’s just department policy. Money,
checkbooks, things like that.
Wallets, pictures LYNN
I’m trying to get pictures!
CONNOR’S BEDROOM
Sheriff #1 hovers over Dennis as he grabs Connor’s books,
things, an Orlando Magic basketball jersey...
DENNIS
Does he have to stand there with
her as she packs up her underwear?!
Is that right?!
SHERIFF #1
It’s policy, sir.
Dennis takes down Connor’s basketball hoop. He notices Rick
standing in the hallway. Rick walks on.
LIVING ROOM
Dennis carries out a box of belongings. Lynn emerges with a
box of her own.
DENNIS
What else mom?
They frantically look around.

15.

LYNN
I want my plants.
SHERIFF #1
There’s no time for that. You need
to step outside now.
RICK CARVER
Let her take the plant.
SHERIFF #1
Your two minutes are long gone, you
need to move.
DENNIS
Can I ask where it says two minutes
on your clipboard?
RICK CARVER
Sir, the two minutes is a courtesy.
DENNIS
The two minutes is what?
RICK CARVER
A courtesy. You’re trespassing
right now. I know it’s painful to
hear but it’s the truth.
LATER
RICK CARVER
Ma’am, do you need anything else?
LYNN
Yes, the toaster oven. My grandson
likes his toast in the mornings.
Rick unplugs the toaster and hands it to her.
LATER
RICK CARVER
Alright, Randy, you said the two
minutes was up, right?
Dennis moves into the living room for the bills on the table.
DENNIS
I’m just getting the bills.
SHERIFF #1
Ok. This way, this way.

16.

He escorts Dennis and Lynn out.
EXT. DENNIS’ HOME - CONTINUOUS
Out of them home where Rick motions to the Locksmith and
BZZZZZZ - startles Dennis. He’s already changing the locks.
SHERIFF #1
(to Rick)
I’m gonna clear it.
He goes back in as Rick escorts Dennis and Lynn to the curb.
RICK CARVER
All the way to the curb. You’re now
trespassing on a bank-owned home you can’t stand in the lawn. All
the way to the curb, please.
DENNIS
We’re going.
LYNN
What about the rest of our things?
RICK CARVER
The clean-out-crew will bring your
belongings to the end of the drive.
No need to worry about that.
They reach the curb; Dennis puts the large plant down.
RICK CARVER
My advice would be to get a moving
truck because your neighbors are
going to have access to everything
you own by the end of the day.
Lynn turns to Dennis, who avoids her look. Rick notices.
Sheriff #1 steps out of the home:
SHERIFF #1
CLEAR!
RICK CARVER
Jeff, get ‘em to it!
He motions to Jeff who leads his crew into the home. Rick
follows them.
NEIGHBORS stare at Dennis and Lynn from their lawns.

17.

Crew exits with sofa, coffee table, TV, and dump them in
front of Dennis and Lynn.
LYNN
(to neighbors)
Can you believe this? They canceled
the eviction and didn’t even tell
these guys.
She is shamed in front of her neighbors.
Crew continue to bring out furniture. Lynn is shaking.
LYNN
Oh my god, oh my god...
Dennis stares, watching his house get emptied by strangers.
Rick stares at Dennis from the porch smoking his e-cigarette.
EXT. DENNIS’ HOME - LATER
The piles of belongings on the street and in Dennis’ truck
have grown larger. The Crew continues to work.
Dennis gathers things; Neighbor Friend and HUSBAND stand near
Lynn, who sits in the chair trying to keep her dignity.
Dennis notices Jeff trying to move his red tool cabinet.
DENNIS
Hey! Yo! Don’t mess with that, man.
You gotta unlock the wheels, and
don’t touch anything inside there.
Jeff ignores him. Dennis mumbles curses and lifts a heavy
overturned chest. He SLAMS scattered drawers into place.
NEIGHBOR FRIEND
Wanna put some stuff in our garage?
We don’t have much room, but...
DENNIS
Some of the valuables. Thanks.
He turns to see: the school bus pull up. Connor, Derek and
some kids get off the bus.
Dennis is uncertain what to do.
Connor takes in what is happening.
The SCHOOL KIDS gossip and giggle as the bus drives away.

18.

DEREK
Yo, what’s happening?...
Suddenly, Connor walks towards the house.
DENNIS
Connor, wait Rick gets in his way.
RICK CARVER
Hey, son. Where you headed?
CONNOR
This is my house.
RICK CARVER
I’m sorry, this isn’t your home
anymore.
CONNOR
That’s my house.
DENNIS
(to Rick)
Please don’t talk to my son. Talk
to me.
(grabs Connor’s arm)
Let’s go.
Connor rips his arm free. Dennis grabs him again. They
struggle as Dennis tries to hold onto him.
CONNOR
Get off! I want to go to my room.
DENNIS
Calm down.
RICK CARVER
Mr. Nash, I know this is difficult,
but please take your son off the
property.
CONNOR
That’s my house. I want to go to my
room.
DENNIS
I know. We’ll go to your room
later.
RICK CARVER
Mr. Nash, please.

19.

DENNIS
I heard you! - Connor, stop.
Rick motions to the Sheriffs who approach while Dennis tries
to control Connor. The Neighbors stare.
CONNOR
Let go of me! Let go! That’s our
house!
Dennis stares at his son... total loss.
EXT. DENNIS’ HOME - LATER
The pile of belongings is even larger. The eviction is over.
Connor and Derek across the street.
DEREK
Where you moving to?
CONNOR
I dunno.
DEREK
Are you coming to school tomorrow?
Connor shrugs; Dennis calls him over; Connor walks when DEREK
Can we still play NBA 2K tomorrow?
CONNOR
See ya...
Dennis puts his mom into the truck next to Connor. Dennis and
his Neighbor friend exchange looks and a hand shake.
Rick approaches Dennis as he gets in his truck.
RICK CARVER
Mr. Nash, you have 24 hours before
my crew will return and dispose of
whatever remains. Not my choice;
Code enforcement. Good luck.
Dennis gets in his truck. Lynn and her friend clasp hands as
the truck pulls away leaving their home behind.

20.

I/E. DENNIS’ PICK-UP TRUCK [MOVING] / ORLANDO - SUNSET
Like Okies from the Dust Bowl, the family is crammed in the
crowded truck.
EXT. MOTEL PARKING LOT - NIGHT
Dennis’ truck pulls in and parks. As they unpack they see:
MOTEL RESIDENTS, THUGS, POOR FAMILIES hang out, drink near
the pool, etc. Balconies piled with belongings, clothes hang
to dry. They realize families live here.
MOTEL WOMAN (40s) hangs with a couple friends at their door
talking.
MOTEL WOMAN
Hey. Welcome. What room ya’ll in?
LYNN
230.
MOTEL WOMAN
It’s over there. We can watch your
stuff while you move... How long
you staying?
DENNIS
Just a couple nights.
MOTEL WOMAN
Two years ago that’s what we said.
EXT. MOTEL STAIRS / HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
They carry boxes up stairs and along the hallway where JUSTIN
(13) and other kids get sodas from a machine and hang out.
They enter INT. MOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Connor runs to the bathroom and pees. Dennis and Lynn look
over the tiny room: two beds, small kitchenette, dripping
faucet. How are they going to live here?
Dennis sets Lynn’s tall plant down.
CONNOR
It smells. Do you think someone
died in here?

21.

LYNN
Don’t say things like that. Get
that side, we can’t sleep in these.
They pull comforters off the beds. As Dennis exits He presses on her shoulder reassuring her.
DENNIS
I’ll get the rest of our stuff.
He exits EXT. MOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
- and pauses to light a cigarette; he hears Connor and turns
to watch his family through the window:
CONNOR
Am I going to school tomorrow?
LYNN
Gotta figure all that out, don’t
we?
CONNOR
I gotta see Derek. We’re in the
middle of an NBA 2K tournament and Dennis looks at his family through the window. HOLD.
EXT. GAS STATION - DAY
Dennis pumps gas - 5, 20, 30 dollars. It’s fucking expensive.
DENNIS (INTO PHONE)
I’m calling about the roofing
job... I got a ton of experience, I
do electric, plumbing,
construction, anything... Okay. Any
lower level stuff?
He looks at little speakers BLARING bad pop music near a flat
screen TV flashing ads about hot dogs and soda.
INT. DENNIS’ TRUCK [MOVING] - DAY
Dennis drives.

22.

DENNIS (INTO PHONE)
What about Booth brothers? They
were putting up those home on - ...
Call me if something comes up.
INT./EXT. DENNIS’ TRUCK / NEW SUBDIVISION - SUNSET
Dennis looks at an OUT OF BUSINESS sign on the construction
trailer. He drives away lost in thought.
INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
Party MUSIC and sounds penetrate the Nash’s tiny room,
bursting with their stuff. Lynn sleeps in one bed. Dennis and
Connor share the other.
Dennis is awake staring at his son, tousling his hair.
LYNN
Dennis, this motel is half-full of
people like us.
DENNIS
They’re not people like us.
LYNN
They’re all evicted. And they get
stuck here. I could maybe take the
bus and start looking for
apartments...
DENNIS
We can’t afford an apartment.
LYNN
It’s just first and last month’s
rent!
DENNIS
Two or three months’ security. Four
maybe, because of our credit. Our
credit is shot.
LYNN
Dennis... We’ve got to get out of
here. We should go to Tampa. We’ve
gotta go to Uncle Jimmy’s, Uncle
Jimmy said we could come. I talked
to Mary Margaret just three days
ago!

23.

DENNIS
Mom, we’re not moving to Tampa. You
wanna take Connor out of school?
Take him away from his friends? We
leave, we give up, we let the house
go.
He tries to give his mom confidence:
DENNIS
I’m gonna figure it out.
Lynn is unsure. But Dennis is resolute.
DENNIS
No choice.
INT. MOTEL ROOM - MORNING
Connor’s playing on his phone.
LYNN
You want some toast?
Dennis rifles through the tool cabinet they’ve brought up to
the room. He notices something missing.
DENNIS
We didn’t leave any tools in my
truck, right?
LYNN
No, we got everything.
Angry, Dennis slams the drawer shuts. Thinks.
EXT. STRIP MALL; RICK'S OFFICE BUILDING - MORNING
Jeff and his clean-out-crew plus four other CREW GUYS have
coffee and donuts near their vans and trucks (MUSIC playing)
outside RICHARD CARVER REALTY. BILL (30s, big and tall) gives
them orders; Dennis pulls up and strides to them.
DENNIS
Your guys stole my tools yesterday.
I want to talk to your boss.
BILL
I’m senior sales manager. What’s
the problem?

24.

DENNIS
(points at Jeff)
That guy right there stole my
impact wrench and in-line sander.
That’s like $500.
BILL
I have a form you can DENNIS
No forms. - Hey man, give me my
tools back.
JEFF
I didn’t steal nothing. Get outta
here.
DENNIS
Where’s my stuff?
JEFF
I didn’t steal nothing. Get outta
here.
DENNIS
You just said that, dumbass.
Crew laugh. Jeff shoves Dennis. They wrestle in the parking
lot. Crew gather and holler.
Rick exits the second story and sees what’s happening.
BILL
Break it up! God damn it, Jeff,
that’s enough.
Rick strides down the stairs.
RICK CARVER
What the fuck is going on?!
He motions and they immediately pull Dennis and Jeff apart.
It takes three Crew guys to hold Dennis back. Jeff tries to
sucker punch him, but Dennis kicks Jeff in the stomach.
RICK CARVER
Bill, you want to get in on this?
Take a couple swings?
BILL
Sir, I -

25.

RICK CARVER
“Sir, I -” “Sir, I -”. What the
fuck are you still doing here
anyway?
BILL
I thought, sir - I thought you RICK CARVER
You thought? You’re evolving? Has
Darwin himself come to Orlando,
Florida?... Well? Bill?
BILL
We’ll be there on time, Mr. Carver.
Guys, let’s go! Buena Vista Lakes.
He rounds up half the guys and drives away. Rick walks up to
Dennis and motions and they release him.
RICK CARVER
You finished? ‘Cause I got the cops
on speed dial. they’ll run you out
of town over a busted tail light.
DENNIS
I’m not here to fight; I just want
my tools.
RICK CARVER
Do I look like Ace Hardware? I
don’t deal in tools, I deal in
homes. There’s a difference.
DENNIS
I know. You took my home from me.
RICK CARVER
No, the bank took your home from
you. I just represent it.
He answers his phone. Dennis lights a cigarette; listens.
RICK CARVER (INTO PHONE)
This is Rick Carver... What?... You
gotta be kidding me. God damn it...
When?... Fuck Hazmat, I’ll call ‘em
myself.
(hangs up; to Jeff)
914 Shader Drive. Now.
JEFF
I thought we had to prep Via Alizar-

26.

CLAP CLAP.
RICK CARVER
Move! Move!
Jeff rounds up crew. Dennis follows Rick to his Range Rover.
DENNIS
Excuse me? Rick Carver Realty?
RICK CARVER
Can you Miguel?
DENNIS
What?
RICK CARVER
Can you work? You have tools. Do
you do construction?
DENNIS
Yeah.
RICK CARVER
I pay $50, cash.
DENNIS
Are you kidding me?
RICK CARVER
$50 shouldn’t be a joke to you.
He speeds away. Dennis mumbles curses, gets in his truck and INT. DENNIS’ TRUCK - CONTINUOUS
- SLAMS the door. Dennis jerks the wheel and speeds through
the light following Rick.
INT./EXT. DENNIS’ TRUCK / SEWAGE HOME - MORNING
Dennis pulls up to a foreclosed home. He sees:
Rick, Jeff and the Crew are taken aback to see a foreclosed
home with nasty black raw sewage creeping out the door.
Rick covers his mouth with a handkerchief and gets his phone.
Jeff and the Crew cover their noses and shove each other like
kids towards the sewage.
Dennis gets out and keeps his distance.

27.

RICK CARVER (INTO PHONE)
I need your Hazmat team here NOW or
I’m looking at a total gut job down
to the God damn studs... Eviction
was next week and these animals
backed up the sewage and skipped
town... What do you mean shit’s not
a hazardous material. Why don’t you
come out here and eat some of it,
maybe that would change your mind.
Rick notices Dennis. Jeff and Crew are surprised to see him.
Jeff steps towards Dennis but Rick WHISTLES for him to stop.
RICK CARVER (INTO PHONE)
The neighbors are threatening to
call the Department of Health, so
if your team isn’t out here in 30
minutes, my next call is gonna be
Fannie about your slow-ass response
time... Fuck you, too!
(hangs up)
God damn it.
He turns to Jeff and the crew.
JEFF
Rick, no. - Mr. Carver! That’s a
hazard. We, we can’t...
RICK CARVER
By tonight, the mold’s up to the
ceiling; by tomorrow, someone’s
paying MONEY to demolish it, and
it’s not going to be me.
Dennis notices Jeff and the others sheepishly back away. ThenDENNIS
$250.
Everyone is surprised. Rick and Dennis lock eyes.
RICK CARVER
$150.
DENNIS
200. That’s a bear and you know it.
RICK CARVER
... Deal.

28.

Dennis grabs a shovel, walks past Jeff and towards the
encroaching sludge and enters into INT. SEWAGE HOME - CONTINUOUS
Stench SLAPS him in the face. Eyes water, holds his breath.
Spray-painted in red on the wall Dennis reads: KILL BANKERS
His boots squish in the sludge. He covers his nose and sees
sewage cascading from the toilet and sinks.
He gags and runs out.
EXT. SEWAGE HOME - CONTINUOUS
Dennis staggers out and vomits in the yard.
Jeff and Crew laugh. Rick remains straight-faced.
JEFF
Harden the fuck up, son!
RICK CARVER
(to Jeff)
There better be a container truck,
shop vacs and giant blowers here in
one hour or I’ll make it my
business that you never work in
Orange County again. You will also
finish Via Alizar today. You’re on
my list, shit fuck.
He approaches Dennis with a cold water bottle.
Dennis drinks, spits, drinks.
RICK CARVER
What else can you do? Framing,
plumbing, electric, roofing?
DENNIS
All of them. Anything.
RICK CARVER
Go on. Finish it.
Dennis head back toward the door. Then looks to the Crew.
DENNIS
Six-pack to the first guy in here
with a shovel... Come on!

29.

Curious, Rick watches the Crew... one of them steps up.
CREW
$200.
RICK CARVER
$100. And Mr. Nash’s six-pack.
Crew accepts. He puts on a dust mask.
DENNIS
Let’s go! Who else? You! Come on, I
know you need the money.
The Men laugh and two more join. Only Jeff remains outside.
DENNIS
Alright, let’s get this shit done.
He wraps his shirt around his nose and mouth - like a bandit.
The others do the same and Dennis leads the men to work.
Rick is impressed.
INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY
Connor looks up from homework as Dennis steps in. Dennis digs
into his dirty jeans and hands Lynn money.
LYNN
$200... ?!
Connor looks up, impressed.
DENNIS
I got work. And there’s more
tomorrow.
LYNN
With who? What work? Dennis!
DENNIS
Some new guy. Real estate. You
don’t know him.
They laugh, overjoyed. Connor tries to take the money. Dennis
play-wrestles it back from him.
EXT. MOTEL PARKING LOT - DAY
Dennis walks fast, Connor drags his feet.

30.

DENNIS
You’re gonna make new friends, ok?
CONNOR
I don’t want to.
They reach Motel Kids and a handful of PARENTS and see a
school bus arrive. Kids board; Connor doesn’t move.
DENNIS
I know. But I need you to be brave.
He tries to rub Connor’s ear but Connor brushes him off.
CONNOR
This isn’t my school.
DENNIS
I know, but you gotta keep your
grades up, remember? You gotta take
care of yourself, ok? I love you.
Connor runs to the bus. Dennis watches the bus drive away.
EXT. RICK'S HOME - DAY
Massive, very impressive and unique, Rick’s home sits at the
end of a deep and beautifully landscaped lawn.
Dennis pulls up; he’s impressed. Grabs his tool box and walks
to the front door when his phone RINGS.
DENNIS (INTO PHONE)
Mr. Carver, I’m RICK CARVER (THROUGH PHONE)
Yeah, I see you. Come around back.
RICK'S POOL WITH LANAI
Dennis enters and sees Rick's DAUGHTERS (6 to 12) playing in
the pool.
RICK'S DAUGHTER
Hey. Can you get us that please?
Dennis uses a pool net to try and push a boat from the center
of the pool to Rick's Daughters on the other side.
Rick walks up steps leading from his dock near the lake.

31.

RICK CARVER
Nash. Princess one, princess two,
princess three! Who wants HaagenDazs? Chocolate chip cookie dough.
RICK'S DAUGHTERS
Me, me, me!
Dennis follows Rick and his girls into INT. RICK'S HOME - CONTINUOUS
- a very impressive living room / kitchen where a MAID works.
DENNIS
Nice house.
RICK CARVER
It’s ok. I got it 18 months ago and
I’m going to flip it after New
Year’s.
(to the maid)
Let’s have some Haagen-Daaz please,
madam.
(to Dennis)
AC’s out for two hours. Through
there. You’ll see the leak.
Dennis exits as Rick crushes cookies into the ice cream.
RICK CARVER
I’m gonna make it even better. See.
ENTRANCE
Dennis walks through the grand entrance, high ceilings, tons
of sunlight. Continues to RICK'S HOME OFFICE
A second living room and sees the water stain on the ceiling.
But his attention is focused to maps of Orange County that
cover the walls and are laid out everywhere. It’s impressive.
Dennis zeros in on framed articles about Rick Carver, Real
Estate tycoon and good citizen of Orlando.
Dennis takes it all in.
RICK’S BEDROOM
Rick grabs a bag and some shirts when his phone RINGS.

32.

RICK CARVER (INTO PHONE)
This is Rick Carver.
MALE’S VOICE (THROUGH PHONE)
Adjustable mortgage cocksucker! I’m
homeless, you motherfucker!
RICK CARVER (INTO PHONE)
Stop calling me! You defaulted on MALE’S VOICE (THROUGH PHONE)
Fuck you, Carver. You piece of Rick hangs up, tense. He notices his Wife smoking on the
terrace outside. She’s been watching him.
TERRACE
Rick steps out and joins her.
RICK’S WIFE
They called here two days ago.
RICK CARVER
Come on boo, I rented you and your
mom a week at the Corazon Spa in
the Keys. I want you to relax,
enjoy yourselves.
RICK'S WIFE
I should divorce you.
RICK CARVER
We’d lose on taxes; and you’d miss
me. You’d miss your little Ricky.
They kiss and make out.
RICK'S ATTIC
Dennis uses a small blow dryer to thaw out frozen coils on
the condensing unit.
EXT RICK’S HOME
With the hose of a small shop vac, Dennis sucks green mold
from the PVC on the side of Rick's house.
EXT. RICK'S HOME - LATER
Dennis drinks a beer near the pool as he stares at Rick's
boat, the lake, the life. RICH PEOPLE ride past in a boat and
wave at Rick who approaches.

33.

RICK CARVER
What’re you doing?
DENNIS
Finished. Give the coils 5 minutes
to drain and you’ll have cold air.
RICK CARVER
It’s not even been an hour.
DENNIS
I salvaged your ceiling with mud
and found some spare paint in your
garage, so your ceiling’s good to
go too.
Rick is impressed.
RICK CARVER
Unless you’re planning on taking a
swim, let’s go.
INT. RICK'S RANGE ROVER [MOVING] - DAY
Through the moving window: homes. Rick glances at Dennis.
RICK CARVER
What do you see out there?
DENNIS
Homes.
RICK CARVER
I just saw nine opportunities to
make money in the last five blocks.
We passed three homes without mail
boxes, one with an overgrown lawn
and no cars in the drive, two with
white signs taped in the window and
three with shiny new doorknobs and
lock-boxes. If you can get attuned
to seeing these opportunities, then
maybe you can get off your hands
and knees and really start working
for me.
DENNIS
I can work. You seen me all week.
RICK CARVER
I heard you worked on good crews
with Rick Kirby and Chris
Camilleri.
(MORE)

34.

RICK CARVER (CONT'D)
They’re both out of business,
because they built homes. I own
homes.
Dennis considers Rick.
RICK CARVER
You know what I am, I am a man with
a helluva lot of properties. You
can be a part of that. What I want
to know is that I can walk away
from any situation, 24/7, and have
someone to handle it. I don’t care
if your kid’s in the school play,
it’s Christmas, or you lined up the
best blow job in Orlando. When you
work for me, you’re mine.
Suddenly Rick hits the brakes.
RICK CARVER
What the hell?
I/E. RICK'S RANGE ROVER / FRANK GREENE’S STREET - CONTINUOUS
Rick goes in reverse. Stops. Looks at two homes, one with a
“Rick Carver Realty” sign in the lawn.
RICK CARVER
Call office.
(DIALING)
You see that? Those cables?

Yeah, yeah, I see it.
Rick points to an extension cord and water hose running from
one house to another.
I/E. RICK'S RANGE ROVER / FRANK GREENE’S HOME - CONTINUOUS
He reverses and parks in front of Frank’s house.
NATALIA (THROUGH SPEAKERS)

RICK CARVER
I got some jack wagon at 354
Ridgeway stealing water and power
from our property at 352 Ridgeway.
(MORE)

35.

RICK CARVER (CONT'D)
Pull up the county court website,
get his name and find out if he’s
in default. I’m in front of his
house now.
NATALIA (THROUGH SPEAKERS)
Right away, sir.
Rick hangs up, opens the glove compartment and produces a gun
- an LCP 308. He hands Dennis the gun.
RICK CARVER
You know how to shoot, right? We’ll
run a background check so you can
carry a concealed weapon.
DENNIS
Are you fucking with me?
RICK CARVER
Angry homeowners. You’ll need it.
Rick checks his Ruger on his ankle holster.
DENNIS
Naw. I’m good.
Dennis puts the gun back in the glove compartment.
RICK CARVER
Suit yourself. But the person on
the other side of the door doesn’t
always feel that way. Trust me.
He shows the marks of a dog bite on his skin.
RICK CARVER
They can feed their Rottweiler, but
they can’t pay for their house.
Dennis considers. Rick’s phone beeps.
RICK CARVER
Ok. Frank Greene. Let’s go.
EXT. FRANK GREENE’S HOME - MOMENTS LATER
Rick KNOCKS loudly. Dennis walks up next to him. Frank Greene
(same man from court) opens the door.
RICK CARVER
Mr. Frank Greene?

36.

FRANK GREENE
Yes.
RICK CARVER
My name is Rick Carver and you’re
stealing from me.
FRANK GREENE
... If you’re referring to the RICK CARVER
- The property next door belongs to
Fannie Mae and I represent it for
them. So you’re not only stealing
from me, you’re stealing from the
United States government.
He answers his RINGING PHONE.
RICK CARVER (INTO PHONE)
Yeah, I’m with Frank Greene now.
What’ve you got for me?
(to Dennis)
Remove those lines.
He steps aside, leaving Dennis alone with Frank Greene.
They walk to the side of the house and begin to disconnect
and coil up the cable and hose.
FRANK GREENE
I saw you in foreclosure court. Our
sons go to the same school. They
were playing with the globe. I had
my show cause hearing that day.
What happened to you?
DENNIS
I lost... I was evicted.
FRANK GREENE
... So what’re you doing with him?
DENNIS
Gotta work, you know? He offered me
a job. This isn’t really what I do.
FRANK GREENE
(regarding cables)
Yeah, this isn’t really what I do
either... I was a manager at Custom
Cabinet and Lighting. Been out of
work for two years. Two. But I’m
not a thief.

37.

DENNIS
I know.
FRANK GREENE
But I’m researching on the internet
and public library. I’m gonna save
my home.
DENNIS
I hope you do. Custom Cabinets yeah, I installed your stuff.
FRANK GREENE
Oh really?
DENNIS
Yeah, a bunch of times.
Frank’s Son (from court) approaches.
FRANK'S SON
Dad, the TV turned off.
DENNIS
You know my boy? Connor Nash?
FRANK’S SON
Yes, sir.
Rick comes back.
RICK CARVER
Mr. Greene, looks like the Bank of
Santa Fe already filed for final
judgment of foreclosure. My money
says the courts send me back for
your eviction in less than 90 days.
FRANK GREENE
I removed the cables and - and I
apologize. I shouldn’t have done
that. That was wrong.
DENNIS
It’s ok, we RICK CARVER
I can assure you, stealing is not
ok. Mr. Nash will personally be
speaking with your neighbors. And
if we receive a report or drive by
and see you stealing my water and
power again, the next visit will be
the Sheriff’s department.

38.

INT. RICK’S RANGE ROVER / FRANK GREENE’S HOME - CONTINUOUS
They sit down in Rick's SUV.
RICK CARVER
Don’t be soft. They’ll tell you sob
stories each time. But the law is
the law, that’s the side you’re on.
You already know the outcome of
this situation. So toughen up.
They drive away.
INT. KITCHEN HOME #1; VARIOUS ROOMS - CONTINUOUS
Dennis follows Rick and looks around the massive home.
RICK CARVER
I’ll take all your Rocky Mountain
door handles MR. HESTER (50s) and Dennis follow him into the dining room RICK CARVER
- the Tiffany light fixtures Moder
Crystal chandelier - into the kitchen RICK CARVER
- the Harlan cabinets, the Thai
Jade and marble counter tops, the
range the Subzero fridge. Three
grand and you gotta be out of here
in two weeks.
MR. HESTER

RICK CARVER
Four and Dennis here will get right
to it.
MR. HESTER
Done.
Dennis starts unscrewing the cabinets.
EXT. KITCHEN HOME #1 & #2 - LATER
Dennis pushes a dolly loaded with cabinets and walks with
Rick to the next home.

39.

RICK CARVER
You know, Mr. Hester made a lot of
money on this property.
DENNIS
You’re evicting him in two weeks.
How’s that?
RICK CARVER
He got this place back in ‘05 for
$400,000, 0% down. One year later,
he took a home equity loan and got
another $200,000 that he used to
buy that sweet little Yellowfin for
fishing trips and to take Mrs.
Hester to Tahiti. By the time this
home was worth half what he’d
borrowed, he just quit paying.
DENNIS
You can’t just quit paying.
RICK CARVER
Sure you can. He hired himself a
lawyer - not to win - but to tie up
his case for three years. Guess how
many mortgage payments he made
during those three years?
DENNIS
None. But he owes money.
RICK CARVER
Lawyer got a short sale approved,
and the bank wiped out his debt.
It’s called, “strategic default.”
While Mr. Greene is stealing my
water and power, this guy was
making a killing. Are you listening
now? Do I have your attention?
DENNIS
Yeah, I heard you.
RICK CARVER
That’s how you should’ve done it.
DENNIS
...
RICK CARVER
Now get everything else and meet me
over there.

40.

Points at the house next door.
EXT. KITCHEN HOME #2 - LATER
Rick uses an iPhone attachment to open an electronic lock
box. A key falls out. Unlocks door. Dennis watches.
INT. KITCHEN HOME #2 - CONTINUOUS
Rick's steps echo in the empty home. Dennis follows him into THE KITCHEN
- where the cabinets, fridge and counter-tops are all gone.
RICK CARVER
Install everything - patch the
tile, caulk the cabinets and
connect the gas line when you bring
in the appliances.
DENNIS
All that in here now?
RICK CARVER
I’m selling this home for Fannie
Mae. I can’t do that if there’s no
kitchen, can I?
DENNIS
No.
RICK CARVER
So who just paid me $33,000 to buy
new cabinets, appliances and a
counter-top plus labor?
DENNIS
Fannie Mae.
RICK CARVER
Fannie Mae. Congratulations. You
just fucked the government.
He hands Dennis an envelope. Dennis takes it, but Rick holds
on tight, refusing to let go.
RICK CARVER
If you’re interested, let me know.
If not, use that to take your kid
to Disney World and get yourself a
job Migueling Cinderella’s Castle.

41.

He lets go of the envelope and exits to the backyard.
Dennis opens the envelope. He’s startled by what he sees: a
check for $3,250.
EXT. KITCHEN HOME #2 / POOL WITH LANAI- CONTINUOUS
Rick answers emails on his phone. Notices Dennis approaching.
DENNIS
I don’t give a damn about the
government. They never did nothing
for me, so... But that was a lot of
money you just gave me. Feels a bit
like trouble.
RICK CARVER
You did honest work building homes
your whole life. What did it get
you but me knocking on your door?
DENNIS
Is this stealing?
RICK CARVER
In 2006, you borrowed $85,000
against your home and never paid it
back, Nash. You’re telling me
that’s not stealing?
DENNIS
No, it’s not stealing. I was given
a loan. That’s me working my ass
off trying to pay back that loan RICK CARVER
That’s not how the banks see it. Or
the tax-payers paying for this
bailout.
Rick picks up overturned chairs by the pool. Dennis follows.
DENNIS
I invested every cent into
construction equipment. The economy
crashed, I can’t predict that. I
can’t predict the weather.
RICK CARVER
Well I can. I’m a fucking Doppler
radar. You’ve been stealing, but
don’t want to admit it. Or the
banks cheated you, take your pick.
(MORE)

42.

RICK CARVER (CONT'D)
Either way you’ve lost. But I made
even more money in the crash than
before it. You can too. But you
need to stop lying to yourself and
ask: What have you been doing wrong
that your family lives in a motel?
Dennis considers, then picks up the last overturned chair.
DENNIS
I’ll do it. But I want you to help
me get my home back. - And this is
my first payment.
He hands Rick the envelope, but Rick refuses.
RICK CARVER
Don’t get emotional about real
estate.
DENNIS
That’s my family home, my boy’s
school. I want it back.
RICK CARVER
Not enough money here. Put that
under your mattress because putting
it in the bank only makes them
money. When you have more, I’ll
tell you what to do with it. - Now,
do you want to double what you
made?

43.

DENNIS
I gotta prove to the bank this

intend to keep it that way.
DENNIS

It’s not a lot, but it’s going to

MS. TIDWELL
Knowing my options?
Her TEENAGE DAUGHTER starts filming Dennis with her phone..
MS. TIDWELL’S DAUGHTER
I’m putting this all on Facebook,
asshole.
MS. TIDWELL
Kayla, put that away!
MS. TIDWELL’S DAUGHTER

You the one that’s been putting
notices on my windows?
DENNIS
No sir, that’s the Sheriffs
department.
ANGRY MAN
I don’t want them to do that
anymore, that’s trespassing.
DENNIS
Sir I can’t control what the
Sheriffs department does, what I
can do is tell you about ANGRY MAN
You’re wasting your time. Just get
outta here. Tell your bank and your
boss I ain’t interested.
DENNIS
If you wanna just take a look at ANGRY MAN
I’m not looking at anything.
DENNIS
You could just take it and not look
at it.
ANGRY MAN
Hold on a second.
The Angry Man leaves. He comes back with a GUN.

INT. STORAGE UNIT - DAY
Dennis pushes up the garage door of the storage unit. Turns
on lights to reveal HVACs and pool pumps. Rick counts them.

48.

RICK CARVER
Eight. And four pool pumps. Good
addition.
DENNIS
I figured “Why not?” Dropped this
one - beyond repair - so better
make it seven.
RICK CARVER
Sell it for scrap metal.
DENNIS
Already priced it out at $300.
RICK CARVER
Good. Invoice Rick Carver Realty
$24K for the ACs and $3,200 for the
pumps. The banks will reimburse me
in that amount. Your take is 25%,
about $6,700.
Dennis is impressed.
DENNIS
I’m gonna need that Ruger.
RICK CARVER
Excuse me? What’d you say?
Dennis looks annoyed.
RICK CARVER
You’re saying you want the gun? Did
I understand you?
EXT. STORAGE UNIT / RICK'S SUV - DAY
Rick opens the glove compartment and hands the gun to Dennis.
RICK CARVER
I ran the background check already.
You’re clear to carry it.
Dennis holds the gun. It’s a little awkward in his hands.
RICK CARVER
Who pays the most out in cash-forkeys? - Fannie & Freddie. Then it’s
BoA.

49.

RICK CARVER (CONT'D)
I want you to go to every one of
their foreclosed property in our
books and find the ones that are
unoccupied. No homeowner. And no
tenant. You got that?

From in the truck Dennis sees Javier peering into a vacant
home (“Rick Carver Realty” sign). Javier runs to the truck.
JAVIER
Empty as a mo-fo! I’d love to live
in this bitch. 3221 Lincoln drive.
Dennis writes the address on a lease agreement.
I/E. DENNIS’ TRUCK / VACANT HOME #2 - DAY

EXT. VACANT HOME #3 - DAY
Dennis fills out a lease and hands it to Crew #2, who signs.
He collects leases from the others who sign their names.
DENNIS
Ok. You are all now “tenants” of
these properties with these lease
agreements.
DENNIS’ CREW
Can we really move in?

50.

DENNIS
No, dumb ass. You can’t really move
in. We need the bank to think you
live here so I can negotiate cashfor-keys deals with all of you.
JAVIER
How much they paying?
DENNIS
... $2,500 checks from the
government and the fucking banks.
JAVIER & DENNIS’ CREW
$2,500! Fuck ‘em up the ass! Yehaw!
They’re happy as hell.
EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY
Dennis stands near golf carts at a distance from Rick, COUNTY
COMMISSIONER LINK (30s-50s) and two RICH MEN who talk on the
green. They shake hands; Rick and Link walk to Dennis.
COUNTY COMMISSIONER LINK
You think Freeman is the way to go?
RICK CARVER
He’s Fannie’s number one attorney
three years running and he can
connect us to bulk buyers. I’m not
talking millions of dollars; I’m
talking billions. - Arthur, this is
Dennis Nash. - County Commissioner
Arthur Link. -Your property on 2102
West Jefferson; I’ll have Dennis
make sure your gutters are re-done.
COUNTY COMMISSIONER LINK
What happened to Bill?
RICK CARVER
Killed him. This is my new guy and
he’s gonna last.
COUNTY COMMISSIONER LINK
Alright, I-I’ll get us a meeting
with Freeman.
(to Dennis)
You want to move up in real estate,
this is the guy.
Link joins the men. Rick and Dennis drive away in a cart.

51.

INT. GOLF CART [MOVING] - CONTINUOUS
Rick drives. Dennis next to him.
RICK CARVER
What do you have for me?
Dennis shows the “fake” leases.
DENNIS
Successfully negotiated six cashfor-keys with six “tenants.”
RICK CARVER
Not bad. So, Nash, how much did you
tell your buddies - $3,500 per home
or less?
DENNIS
$3,500. Yeah.
RICK CARVER
Oh. You told them the full amount?
DENNIS
I told them what I told them. What
do you care?
Rick smiles like a devil.
EXT. RICK'S EMPTY MCMANSION #1 - DAY
Rick parks the cart at the back of a massive, beautiful
McMansion and walks to the swimming pool.
Confused, Dennis follows Rick who greets TAMIKA, a gorgeous
African American woman (early 20s) busy texting at the pool.
RICK CARVER
You look gorgeous, baby.
TAMIKA
I know.
He kisses her for a while. Dennis watches, uncertain.
RICK CARVER
Don’t you have classes today?
TAMIKA
It’s all online. Can we go to
Capital Grille tonight?

52.

RICK CARVER
Sure why not?
He motions to Dennis who follows Rick. Rick shows him his
business card.
RICK CARVER
That’s my sweetheart. She studies
graphic design. I had her do my
business cards.
They enter INT. RICK'S EMPTY MCMANSION #1 - CONTINUOUS
Dennis notices the mansion is empty except for a mattress on
the floor, a sofa, coffee table, and couple suitcases.
DENNIS
Is this yours?
RICK CARVER
Just keeping it warm. Scan the
leases so we can email Fannie and
BoA.
Dennis moves to the scanner.
RICK CARVER
So, Nash - why aren’t you married?
DENNIS
Uh. Don’t really have time for it.
RICK CARVER
I don’t trust a man who isn’t
married. Nobody does. - You want to
tell me what happened to Connor’s
mom?
DENNIS
Not really.
RICK CARVER
Prom night fiaso?
DENNIS
Close, yeah, something like that.
Rick studies him for a moment.
He produces a check from the paperwork on his desk.

53.

RICK CARVER
Your check from the ACs and pool
pumps. Came out higher than I
thought - $7,200.
Dennis opens the envelope and sees the check... then hands it
back to Rick.
DENNIS
Keep it. I’ll give you the $3,000 I
already made, and add my share from
these leases. I want my home back.
RICK CARVER
BPO on your home came in at $170K.
I’ll buy it and you’ll owe me.
$155,000 at 12% amortized over 30
years with a two year balloon.
DENNIS
Jesus, that’s a shitty rate.
RICK CARVER
No bank’ll loan you money and if
you don’t pay, I’m on the hook. And
I don’t want that property; it
doesn’t have a future.
DENNIS
It’s my family home.
RICK CARVER
It’s a home. But if you want it,
it’s yours. It’ll take the bank
eight to twelve weeks to list it on
the MLS; you can do repairs, but
you can’t move in until then.
DENNIS
And the contract?
RICK CARVER
I’ll have my office provide you the
contract for deed.
DENNIS
So it’s mine again?
RICK CARVER
Yes, it’s yours.
DENNIS
Ok. Thank you. Seriously thank you.

54.

He extends his hand. Rick awkwardly shakes it. Dennis is
emotional.
RICK CARVER
No tears.... drink?
DENNIS
No. I’m good.
Rick pours a drink from the bar.
RICK CARVER
You might want to reconsider. We
have one more stop today. 224
Lakeview Court.
DENNIS
That’s Mr. Tanner. I offered him a
Wells Fargo cash-for-keys.
RICK CARVER
He never called and his eviction is
today. You can pop your cherry with
him. The first one’s a bitch. You
get numb to it. Stand next to me
today, but after this you’ll do ‘em
on your own.
DENNIS
Listen, Rick. Can’t I RICK CARVER
Go fuck yourself? Yes. What’d you
think working for me would mean?
DENNIS
I just thought RICK CARVER
No, you didn’t think about it. And
you didn’t have the guts to ask me.
Nobody does. But who in their right
mind wouldn’t rather put someone in
a home than drag them out of it. Up
until three years ago I used to be
a regular real-estate broker,
putting people into homes and
speculating on properties. That was
my job. - In 2006, Robert and Julia
Tanner borrowed 30 grand to put an
enclosed patio on their home which
they had managed to live without
for 25 years.
(MORE)

55.

RICK CARVER (CONT'D)
Ask them when they’re spitting in
your face as you walk them to the
curb. Ask the banks why they gave
them an adjustable rate mortgage.
Ask the government why they lifted
all regulations and turned a blind
eye. You, the Tanners, the banks,
Washington and every other
homeowner and investor from here to
China turned my life into
evictions. I’m not an aristocrat. I
wasn’t born into it. My dad was a
roofer. I grew up on construction
sites watching him work his ass off
until he fell from a townhouse. A
lifetime of insurance payments and
they dropped him before he could
buy a wheelchair but only after
they got him hooked on pain
killers. Do you think I’m going to
let that happen to me? Do you think
America 2010 gives one damn about
Carver or Nash? America doesn’t
bail out the losers. America was
built by bailing out the winners.
By rigging a nation of the winners,
by the winners, for the winners. Do
you go to church Nash? Do you?
DENNIS
Yeah.
RICK CARVER
Only 1 in 100 is gonna get on the
Ark and every other poor soul’s
going to drown. I’m not going to
drown.
They lock eyes for a long beat.
DENNIS
I’ll do it alone. I’ve seen you do
it. I know how it’s done. I’ll do
it alone.
I/E. DENNIS’ TRUCK / TANNER HOME - DAY
From through the windshield of Dennis’ truck:
Jeff, Crew and Locksmith loiter in the Tanners’ lawn;
NEIGHBORS gather; the Sheriffs get out of their cruisers.

56.

Dennis sees this from inside his truck. It’s hot and sweaty.
The windows are rolled up. He doesn’t want to be here.
CLACK CLACK CLACK
Sheriff #1 bangs his nightstick; Dennis unrolls his window.
SHERIFF #1
(laughing)
Hoooooly shit! Rick told me, but Let’s go, rookie! Don’t think I got
dressed up just for you.
He laughs and walks off. Dennis opens the glove compartment
and pulls out the gun. He holsters it on his ankle.
EXT. TANNER HOME - MOMENTS LATER
Dennis sweats as he walks to Mr. Tanner and MRS. TANNER
standing at their front door with the two Sheriffs.
DENNIS
Good morning, Mr. Tanner. Ma’am.
I’m Dennis Nash, from Rick Carver
Realty.
MR. TANNER
I remember you, Mr. Nash. Why,
why’re you here?
DENNIS
Um, I’m sorry to say, this home has
been foreclosed on and transferred
to the bank. I hate to be here
doing this, but I’ll need you to
please step out of the property
now.
MR. TANNER
No, I, I... my wife’s on the phone
right now with our lawyer. You see,
this is a mix-up and we’re going to
have it all sorted out.
DENNIS
I understand, Mr. Tanner, but MR. TANNER
Honey! Honey, do you have him on
the line?
DENNIS
Sir, it’s not going to matter -

57.

Dennis sees Mrs. Tanner and two kids come to the door.
MRS. TANNER
He wasn’t there. They said he’ll
call us back.
MR. TANNER
There you go. We have to wait.
We’re filing an appeal, there’s no
point in you being here right now.
DENNIS
I understand Mr. Tanner. But what I
have here is a court order signed
by the judge. What I can do is give
you a few minutes to gather your
personal items. Your checkbook,
jewelry, medicines... your kids’...
important belongings, but then I’m
going to have to ask you to vacate
the home.
MRS. TANNER
Well, I don’t care. You were not
supposed to be here today, so you
need to leave now.
DENNIS
Ma’am. What I can do is MRS. TANNER
You are leaving. We are going back
inside.
SHERIFF #1
Please calm down ma’am.
MRS. TANNER
I am calm. I am calm.
SHERIFF #1
Don’t close the door ma’am.
Sheriff #1 moves Dennis aside. Sheriff #2 steps up.
MR. TANNER
You’re trespassing. You all need to
leave.
SHERIFF #1
No, you and your wife are
trespassing.

you straight to the curb or the
county jail. You decide.
Dennis sees the Tanners go inside with the Sheriffs.
Dennis sees Jeff smirking at him.
Dennis sees the Sheriffs escort the Tanners out, clutching
bags, kids crying.
SHERIFF #1
Clear. Get your men in here, Nash.
Dennis motions to his crew who come marching up the lawn and
in the house.
SHERIFF #1
They can’t stand there.
Dennis takes a deep breath and approaches the Tanners.
DENNIS
Mr. Tanner, ma’am, please walk with
me to the curb.
MR. TANNER
What?
DENNIS
Let’s just go to the curb, please.
He guides them to the street.
MR. TANNER
You’re responsible for this. You
know that right? What happens to
me, to my family. That’s on you.
They reach the curb.
DENNIS
I’m sorry Mrs. Tanner. I didn’t
want to do this today, I tried to
avoid this MRS. TANNER
How do you live with yourself? Do
you have a family? How could you?
Shame on you. Shame on you.
Jeff and crew start piling stuff up in front of them. Mr.
Tanner begins to weep.

59.

MRS. TANNER
It’s ok, baby, it’s ok.
INT. TANNER HOME - CONTINUOUS
Dennis stands alone in the Tanner’s living room watching the

here? Grab these brushes.
They get paint cans and brushes from the back of the truck.
CONNOR
Are we breaking in?
LYNN
Ask your dad.
Dennis uses an iPhone extension to signal the lock box to
open. The key pops out. Lynn gasps.
CONNOR
There’s an app for that?
INT. DENNIS’ HOME - CONTINUOUS
They enter. Lynn and Connor are amazed, looking around.
LYNN
What are we doing?
CONNOR
What are we doing here?
They walk in. Lynn sees her garden has withered; weeds.
LYNN
Oh my god, look.
CONNOR
What are we doing here??
DENNIS
I got the home back.

61.

LYNN
What??
CONNOR
Does that mean I get my room back?
DENNIS
Yup.
Connor runs to his room.
LYNN
How’d you get the house back?
CONNOR
My room looks so big!
DENNIS
That’s becuase it is.
(to Lynn)
We won’t be able to move in for a
couple weeks, but... It’s ours
again. I’ll explain.

you can break the wall down! And
the wall should be silver like the
Orlando magic.

62.

DENNIS
You know what else I was thinking?
I was thinking in the backyard we
could get a pool.
CONNOR
A pool?! Yeah!

You have to help me paint the house

just like a bank.

(suspicious)
What does he get?
DENNIS
He gets his money back. He gives me
work so he’s keeping me working.
(about Connor)
He’s painting his room right now. I

Tesken Equity Management just
picked up 400 homes in the last two
months, all-cash buys - no loans. A
hundred million dollars. Orange
County needs your help to find
another bulk buyer like Tesken.
As they talk Dennis notices Freeman’s Lawyer who beat him in
court.
MR. FREEMAN
And I’d like to know where the new
highway that’s to connect 414 and
the Apopka Expressway is going to
be.
COUNTY COMMISSIONER LINK
Yes, well, that information isn’t
public yet, so...

There’s a bulk buyer here out of
New York, Vesic Investment Group.
But they’re shopping with a pissant
broker out of Kissimmee named Ortiz
who just sold them 15 homes last
month.

Excuse me, sir. I know Ortiz. I can
get Vesic Investment Group away
from him and my team can handle as
many homes as you have to sell.
MR. FREEMAN
I have upwards of 1000 homes.
Possibly more. Get me Vesic and
we’ll be in business.
EXT. DOWNTOWN ORLANDO - DAY

money we’re talking about? Track
Ortiz, find who he’s talking to and

We need to know what the Vesic deal
is.
DENNIS
Rick. What’s my cut?
RICK CARVER
Shut the fuck up and get going.

You can’t handle 1000 homes without
me. Standard commission is 6%.

6 and a hand job. No calluses.
You’ll pull in something between

No, not at all. Just come to see
how you’re doing. If you want,
maybe I can get you a job.
FRANK GREENE
Nice suit. Still working for your
friend?
DENNIS
I didn’t have to come here. I just
wanted to FRANK GREENE
To lie to me? To cheat me?
DENNIS
To help you. Have you thought about
where your kids are gonna live when
you lose this? It’s not pretty.
FRANK GREENE
My kids have a home. This one right
here. I did research and took boxes
of files to a lawyer. Pro-bono.
(MORE)

72.

FRANK GREENE (CONT'D)
I’m going to win my home legally,
in court.
DENNIS
Be realistic. The judges don’t
care, and the courts FRANK GREENE
“Be realistic?” I didn’t ask for
your help, sir. And I don’t want
it. You’re trespassing. Please get
off my property and don’t come here
again.
INT. RICK'S EMPTY MCMANSION #2 - DAY
Rick drinks whiskey as Dennis thinks.
RICK CARVER
There’s over 100 homes in this
deal. Ortiz, the king of the
Miguels, is going to sell 100 homes
to Vesic.
(points at maps on wall)
They’re all in these neighborhoods,
priced between $165 and $200K.
We’re talking upwards of a $20
million deal. And it’s not mine.
DENNIS
Holy shit.
Tamika enters with an iPad and wraps her arms around Rick.
TAMIKA
Triple word score. Take that.
RICK CARVER
We’re working.
TAMIKA
I know. Dennis, tell him to take a
break.
DENNIS
Rick. Take a break.
Suddenly, Rick wraps his arms around her and gives her a
deep, passionate kiss.
Dennis studies maps on the wall. Then -

73.

DENNIS
Vesic already bought 15 homes from
Ortiz last month.
RICK CARVER
So?
DENNIS
I’m going to take out all the ACs,
water pumps, and appliances from
those homes. And who do you think
Vesic will blame?
RICK CARVER
Ortiz. They’ll call immigration and
put him on his lawn mower back over
the border while I’m on the phone
with the Bank of Santa Fe.
DENNIS
And we’ll sell a 100 homes.
RICK CARVER
And 1000 more for Freeman. I see
green skies ahead.
DENNIS
Start by putting green in my
pocket. I’ll empty out the 15 homes
tonight. $100 a pop. $1,500.
EXT. ORTIZ HOME - AFTERNOON
Dennis uses his iPhone to open the electronic lock box.
Javier and Dennis’ Crew (two) approach with dollies.
JAVIER
HVACs and water pumps?
DENNIS
Get the appliances this time too dishwasher, fridge, oven. Skip
microwaves.
Dennis uses his iPhone to get the key.
JAVIER
You’re going in?
DENNIS
You’re going in.

74.

JAVIER
Nah, that’s B&E man, that’s
guaranteed time right there.
DENNIS
It’s not B&E if you got a key we’re doing appliances, fridges...
JAVIER
Aiight.
I/E. DENNIS’ TRUCK / DENNIS’ NEW HOME - SUNSET
Dennis drives and talks on phone.
DENNIS (INTO PHONE)
Yeah. Rick said he wanted me to
handle the short sale for him, so
I’m heading there now. - Hang on.
He notices something and stops in front of an impressive home
with a “foreclosure Rick Carver Realty” sign in the yard.
DENNIS (INTO PHONE)
Do you know if 1484 Lakewood Drive
is for sale?... I just drove by the
place... Yeah? Does it have a
pool?... Let me call you back.
He opens the door and looks at: a beautiful, large, stucco
home with palm trees. Paradise.
EXT. MOTEL; SWIMMING POOL
It’s Connor’s birthday. Dennis grills, Lynn cuts cake, Connor
is happy. Derek, the neighborhood kids, Justin and the motel
kids are all there.
LATER
Lynn holds the pinata and Dennis and Connor smash it
together, father and son are happy together.
LATER
Lynn wonders where Dennis is. Dennis returns with a brand new
bike for Connor. Connor jumps all over it.
CONNOR
Whoa!
Connor hugs his dad and runs off with Derek and friends.

75.

EXT. MOTEL PARKING LOT - LATER
Dennis and Lynn watch Derek and Connor ride bikes. Justin and
motel kids ride old bikes and scooters. Families around.
DENNIS
Show us what you got!
Connor rides circles around Dennis as Lynn looks on, happy.
Then... an EVICTED FAMILY (husband, wife, two kids) drives
up. Confused and exhausted, they unpack their station wagon.
LYNN
(about the family)
Hey Connor, let’s see if these guys
want some of your cake. We got some
cheese pizza left - you wanna ask
if they want some cheese pizza?
Dennis stares at the family; something’s wrong. He turns and
starts to leave abruptly.
DENNIS
Alright, I gotta get Derek home.
LYNN
Okay, we’re just gonna grab some
pizza and some cake, I think it’d
be nice to say hi to these guys.
DENNIS
Fine, I just gotta get Derek home.
The EVICTED MAN sees Dennis.
EVICTED MAN
Hey! Hey! Where you going? Hey you!
Over here. I’m talking to you!
Dennis reluctantly turns. The Evicted Man is visibly angry.
DENNIS
You’re talking to me?
EVICTED MAN
Yeah, I’m talking to you. What’re
you doing here? Are you following
me?
DENNIS
No, I live here. I don’t know what
you’re talking about so...

76.

EVICTED MAN
Yeah, I know who you are. What’re
you doing here?
DENNIS
What?
EVICTED MAN
What are you doing here?
DENNIS
What do you mean? I live here, I
just told you I live here. I don’t
know you, ok?
EVICTED MAN
No, you’re Rick Carver Realty, I
know exactly who you are.
Dennis starts trying to move the Man away from his family.
DENNIS
Listen, listen - you don’t know me.
I don’t know you.
EVICTED MAN
I know you! You kicked me out of my
home!
DENNIS
What?
Lynn’s face darkens. Connor looks on, confused.
DENNIS
I don’t know you!
EVICTED MAN
You work with Rick Carver, you
kicked me out of my home!
DENNIS
Come over here, we’ll talk.
EVICTED MAN
Why would I wanna go over there? I
wanna talk right here. Nash, that’s
your name, isn’t it?
Connor stares.

77.

EVICTED MAN
You don’t want everyone else here
to know what a fucking asshole you
are? And how you kicked me and my
family out of our home?
DENNIS
You got me mixed up with somebody.
EVICTED MAN
No I don’t. I know exactly who you
are.
Everyone at the motel is watching now. Evicted families,
kids, neighbors.
DENNIS
Just calm down.
EVICTED MAN
You kicked me out of my home! You
ruined my fucking life!
Dennis tries to leave. Evicted Man shoves him back.
EVICTED MAN
No, you don’t get to go anywhere!
DENNIS
(getting angry)
Don’t do that.
LYNN
Dennis!
DENNIS
Get inside!
EVICTED MAN
Yeah, get inside!
DENNIS
(shoves him)
Don’t fucking talk to her!
EVICTED MAN
What’re you gonna fucking do?!
He shoves Dennis and they are in a fight. Lynn, Connor, Derek
and the entire motel watches.
LYNN
Stop, please!

78.

Connor watches Dennis and Evicted Man fighting. Motel people
try to break it up.
EVICTED MAN
You motherfucker!
DENNIS
(to Lynn, Connor)
Go inside! Go inside!
LYNN
Dennis!
DENNIS
Take Connor inside!
LYNN
Okay!
Lynn takes Connor, still staring, away. Motel people finally
get the Evicted Man away from Dennis.
EVICTED MAN
You ruined my life!
DENNIS
I’m not messing with this guy, he’s
crazy. I don’t know you.
EVICTED MAN
You know me!
DENNIS
I don’t fucking know you!
EVICTED MAN
I know you, Rick Carver Realty! I
know you! I’ll see you every day.
When you wake up. When you go to
bed. When your fucking kid is
playing.
INT. MOTEL ROOM - SUNSET
Connor’s new bike in the cramped room; Lynn and Connor sit
silently. Dennis stares out the window.
DENNIS
You okay?
LYNN
How’d he know your name?

79.

DENNIS
I don’t know.
LYNN
Because he knew your face too.
DENNIS
I don’t know, I work on foreclosed
homes, maybe he saw me at his house
or LYNN
Rick Carver, Dennis? Is that who
you’re working for?
DENNIS
No. No, I don’t work for him.
LYNN
You’re kicking people out of their
homes? Like the people who live
here?
DENNIS
No! I don’t LYNN
That man just said DENNIS
He’s lying, ok. I’m not kicking
anyone out of their home! That guy
was crazy. You saw him. That
asshole Carver, he just represents
his home by chance. That’s it.
She doesn’t buy it.
Someone BANGS on the window startling them all.
MOTEL TENANT (O.S.)
ASSHOLE!!
Dennis pulls the curtains shut; the room gets dark. Silence.
LYNN
We can’t stay here. Connor can’t
stay here.
DENNIS
We’re not going to. I’m not doing
anything wrong, so stop giving me
all this shit.

80.

LYNN
Are you evicting people?
DENNIS
MOM!
LYNN
He said you were at his eviction!
DENNIS
I don’t know that fucking guy! I
don’t know how he knows me, I work
on foreclosed homes, mom! This guy
got foreclosed on, maybe he saw me
at his home, I don’t know!
He opens the door to leave.
DENNIS
Lock the door. And keep the
curtains closed.
He slams the door shut leaving Lynn and Connor alone.
CUT TO:
AERIAL VIEW OF: Walt Disney World, Sea World, The Magic
Kingdom castle... then neighborhoods, homes and more homes.
INT. MOVING HELICOPTER - AFTERNOON
Rick points out landmarks to Khanna. It’s stuffy and sweaty.
They shout to hear one another.
Dennis stares out the window, amazed at the amount of homes,
the size, the scope. His imagination runs wild. HOLD.
RICK CARVER
Disney World, Sea World, Universal
Studios. Downtown Orlando’s 10
miles at your 2 o’clock, and at
your 4 o’clock you’ll see the Bank
of Santa Fe homes.
KHANNA
I never realized how close they
were to shine-ola.
RICK CARVER
About the Bank of Santa Fe deal -

81.

KHANNA
- it hasn’t even been a week since
we picked up 15 homes from Ortiz
and all the appliances, ACs and
water pumps are missing.
RICK CARVER
You’re kidding me?
KHANNA
That’s $150,000 hit. Hidden
expenses kill returns, so Vesic’s
not interested anymore.
RICK CARVER
This Bank of Santa Fe deal is like
one giant ATM machine. What can I
do to get Vesic back into those
homes?
KHANNA
I just don’t think it’s possible.
RICK CARVER
How about this: I’ll put appliances
back in those 15 homes - free of
charge - and you move The Bank of
Santa Fe from Ortiz over to me.
Khanna smiles. Rick is uncertain why...
KHANNA
Tell you what. Put brand spanking
new appliances, ACs and water pumps
into any of the 100 homes that need
them and you got yourself a deal.
DENNIS
Appliances, yes. ACs and water
pumps, no.
Rick is surprised Dennis spoke.
KHANNA
Ok. But the homes have to be
unoccupied in 30 days. Put it in
writing and you have a deal.
INT. RICK’S EMPTY MCMANSION #2 - NIGHT
Empty-Mansion-Party. Dennis, Rick, Tamika, KARINA (20s),
LINK, sexy young WOMEN and DISTINGUISHED TYPES mingle. MUSIC.

82.

LATER
Rick and Dennis talk above the crowd near a chandelier.
RICK CARVER
For the Santa Fe deal I’ll give you
6% of my share. You’ll end up with
around $63,000 pre-tax.
DENNIS
(grins)
I guess I can accept that, 63,000, you said? Shit yes!
Tamika and Karina arrive with drinks.
RICK CARVER
You used to dream about one home.
Now it’s 100.
DENNIS
(raises glass)
To dreams.
TAMIKA & KARINA
To dreams.
RICK CARVER
Fuck dreams. To 100 homes.
INT. RICK’S EMPTY MCMANSION #2 - LATER
Everyone dances. Karina grinds Dennis. Rick and Tamika more
romantic.
Drunk, Dennis rubs his face - he’s losing control.
EXT. RICK'S EMPTY MCMANSION #2 - NIGHT
Rick dangles his feet in the water, smoking a cigar. Dennis
comes down the walkway.
RICK CARVER
Uh-oh. The Zombie is coming to get
me.
Dennis slumps on the dock beside him, drunk. Thinks.
DENNIS
Has anyone ever come up to you,
somewhere, after an eviction?

83.

RICK CARVER
Someone tried to run me off the
road a year ago. I haven’t gone to
dinner once with my wife and girls
in the last three years without
looking over my shoulder. It’s why
I carry this, even now, 5am.
He takes his gun out and shows it.
DENNIS
Is it worth it?
RICK CARVER
... As opposed to what?
DENNIS
...
RICK CARVER
Did someone get to you?
DENNIS
No.
RICK CARVER
Bullshit. Someone’s calling you. Or
they found you?
Dennis says nothing. Rick sets his gun down between them.
RICK CARVER
So. Nash. The sun is coming up and
here we are. What do you think?
DENNIS
About what?
RICK CARVER
You wanted to kill me once. Now
you’re going to make a lot of
money.
DENNIS
I did wanna kill you. I dunno. I
dunno what I’m doing here, but I’m
thankful. What can I do, you know,
my dad... Well he killed himself
pretty much.
(holds up his drink, then
pours it out)
Sorry to waste your booze. He died
of a heart attack, booze, food,
whatever you wanna call it.
(MORE)

84.

DENNIS (CONT'D)
Left me with my mom, my boy... My
boy... As opposed to what?...
Rick stares on.
DENNIS
I need to move into my home. Now. I
can’t wait anymore.
RICK CARVER
It’s gotta be listed for sale on
the MLS first. Few more weeks.
DENNIS
No. I can’t stay in that motel any
longer.
RICK CARVER
Just pick another one. You got the
money now, buy whatever you want.
There’s plenty of homes in the sea.
Like I said, don’t get emotional
about real estate, Nash! They’re
boxes. You listening? Big boxes,
small boxes. What matters is how
many you got. You’re gonna have
more properties than women to fill
‘em with. You know that, right? Buy
one for your mom, one of your kid
and one for yourself. What do I
care? Yes sir, 100 homes...
DENNIS
1000 fucking homes.
Rick lies down and smokes his cigar.
RICK CARVER
Watch out for the gators. They
don’t sleep. Make sure I don’t roll
into the water.
Dennis thinks about the future... something on his mind.
INT. DENNIS’ TRUCK [MOVING] - DAY
Dennis drives the family in the packed truck, just like when
they were first evicted.
LYNN
Why are we going this way?

85.

DENNIS
I want to show you something.
Lynn stares out the window, uneasy.
EXT. DENNIS’ NEW HOME - AFTERNOON
The large beautiful home that Dennis saw earlier. He pulls
up; they get out.
Lynn and Connor are confused.
LYNN
What is this?
DENNIS
Just trust me and follow me please.
INT. DENNIS’ NEW HOME - CONTINUOUS
Dennis opens the door.
LYNN
What is this?
DENNIS
Have a look.
LYNN
Why?
DENNIS
Come on! Just a quick tour.
They are startled by the size and high-ceilings.
He shows them around, a large master bedroom and two others
rooms - all furnished.
CONNOR
It’s a cool pool.
DENNIS
I’d say. You wanna dive in, right?
CONNOR
Who’s basketball hoop is that?
DENNIS
I think that used to belong to
Shaquille O’Neal.
(MORE)

86.

DENNIS (CONT'D)
But he lowered it because he likes
to dunk sitting down.
LYNN
Can we go now? Please?
DENNIS
You see the pool?
Lynn shrugs.
DENNIS
I bought this for you.
Connor and Lynn don’t get it. Dennis points to the pool.
DENNIS
(to Connor)
And you. That’s your pool.
LYNN
Let’s go home, this isn’t funny.
DENNIS
I’m not joking, mom.
LYNN
That’s not his basketball net. This
is somebody else’s. And I want our
house. I wanna go home.
DENNIS
I sold that home. I sold it and
flipped the money into this. This
is ours, fresh start. I don’t want
to go back to the house we were
evicted from.
LYNN
(shocked)
You sold our house?
DENNIS
There is no more home. We couldn’t
move in there for three weeks, and
we had to move, didn’t we? So I got
this. I had to get us out of that
motel so Connor wouldn’t get
killed, so I wouldn’t get killed LYNN
Who gave you this home? How did you
get it? By kicking people out of
their homes? You buy this?!

87.

DENNIS
I didn’t kick anybody out of this
home, I bought this home with money
that I earned! So I could put a
roof over your head and I could put
food in his mouth! We were
drowning, mom, we had to get out!
LYNN
It stops here.
DENNIS
I bought this fair and square. I
didn’t take it from anyone.
LYNN
I’m gonna call Jimmy. We’re moving
to Tampa. Come on Connor.
She walks to the door with Connor.
DENNIS
Wait. Mom.
LYNN
And you’re gonna figure this out.
DENNIS
I did this for Connor. We were
drowning.
LYNN
Rick Carver? Rick Carver who bought
our house for us? I’m not staying
here. I’m not staying in this home.
Dennis looks at Connor.
DENNIS
What do you want?
Connor goes to his mom. Dennis is devastated.
I/E. DENNIS’ HOME - NIGHT
Dennis turns on the swimming pool light while drinking a
beer. He’s drunk. Turns on all the lights in the backyard.
Lynn prepares Connor a simple dinner. She glances at Dennis
turning on lights throughout the house.
Connor looks up at his father through the windows.

88.

INT. DENNIS’ NEW HOME - MORNING
He walks through his empty home. He goes to Lynn’s locked
bedroom door and knocks.
DENNIS
Connor?... Mom, is Connor okay?
LYNN (O.S.)
He’s sleeping.
EXT. DENNIS’ NEW HOME - MORNING
Dennis paces around the pool smoking. His phone RINGS. He
looks at the home as he talks.
DENNIS (INTO PHONE)
Hi Rick... Right now? -... ok.
INT. WILLIAM FREEMAN’S LAW FIRM - MORNING
Dennis enters and sees:
Freeman’s office in the distance. Behind the glass windows
are Rick, Freeman, Link, and Freeman’s Associate.
Dennis sees a YOUNG LAWYER run from one end of the office
with a paper in his hand. He enters Freeman’s office and
hands the paper to Freeman, who looks it over and nods.
Freeman hands the paper to Rick, who walks out of the office
and bee-lines to Dennis.
RICK CARVER
One of the Santa Fe homeowners is
blocking his eviction in court
tomorrow. If he’s successful and
others will follow and Vesic will
pull out.
He hands the paper to Dennis.
RICK CARVER
This is a proof of publication; it
wasn’t filed six months ago.
Freeman’s boys just back dated and
notarized it. You need to be at the
courthouse globe at 9:45 a.m. The
Court Clerk will meet you there.
Give it to him.

89.

DENNIS
This is forged?
RICK CARVER
It’s a stupid piece of paper
someone forgot to file when the
loan was being bought and sold a
million times over. It’s just a
technicality.
Dennis looks at the paper and turns white as he reads:
DENNIS
... Frank Greene.
RICK CARVER
Yeah, the same deadbeat who was
stealing my water and power. I told
you he was no good.
He CLAPS loudly and startles a distracted Dennis.
RICK CARVER
HEY! That’s not your dick in your
hand. That’s the Santa Fe deal, 100
homes, 1000 more with Freeman, our
money, Miami, your home,
everything. You awake or what?
DENNIS
Yeah. Yes. Ok.
RICK CARVER
Don’t “yeah, yes, ok” me.
Courthouse globe. 9:45 am.
INT. COURT / GLOBE AREA - MORNING
The envelope in hand, a hesitant Dennis looks at the globe.
On the other side of the room, he spots Frank Greene speaking
with his attorney. He’s careful not to be seen.
Dennis sees Frank hug his WIFE and kids. They’re optimistic.
They’re going to win.
He stares at Frank’s Son, a lot like Connor.
FRANK’S SON
(to the lawyer)
Hello.
He shakes hands with the lawyer.

90.

INT. COURT BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Dennis rubs his face with water.
BEEP BEEP.
He reads texts from Rick: where the fuck are you? / call me!
Dennis looks at his RINGING phone. It’s Rick calling. Dennis
declines the call. The time on his phone reads: 9:52am.
He dries his face and looks at himself in the mirror.
RINGING. RINGING.
DENNIS (INTO PHONE)
Hel INT. FREEMAN’S OFFICE - MORNING
Rick tries not to shout RICK CARVER (INTO PHONE)
What the hell’s going on?!
INTERCUT BETWEEN RICK AND DENNIS
DENNIS (INTO PHONE)
Nothing, I RICK CARVER (INTO PHONE)
Get your ass to the globe now, or
consider your life over. How far
are you?
DENNIS (INTO PHONE)
I’m here now.
RICK CARVER (INTO PHONE)
And?
DENNIS (INTO PHONE)
I’m about to give it to him.
RICK CARVER (INTO PHONE)
Dumb fuck! Call me as soon as it’s
over.
Hangs up. Dennis stands in the bathroom, envelope in hand.

91.

INT. COURT / GLOBE AREA - MOMENTS LATER
The Court Clerk (from Dennis’ eviction) paces near the globe.
Dennis sees him. Instead of approaching, he turns and leaves.
COURT CLERK
Hey!... Hey!
Dennis sees the Clerk taking quick strides to him.
COURT CLERK
Are you with Rick Carver?
Dennis hesitates.
COURT CLERK
Are you with Rick Carver? Are you
with Carver or not?
Dennis doesn’t respond.
COURT CLERK
Is that it?
The Clerk grabs it from him.
COURT CLERK
Idiot!
He quickly leaves. Dennis stands alone.
INT. COURT ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Dennis peers though the window of the double doors and sees:
Frank Greene next to his Attorney adjacent to Freeman Lawyer.
JUDGE
As far as I can tell, the proof of
publication is here.
The Bailiff hands the paper to Frank’s Lawyer.
FREEMAN LAWYER
Your Honor, we already have a buyer
in place and we’d like to get this
property off the books.
FRANK’S LAWYER
If we check the file index, I’m
sure this has not been docketed.

92.

JUDGE
That may be, but the proof is in
the file and that’s all the statute
requires. I’m ordering the sale to
go forward.
FRANK GREENE
Wait a second... what? Your Honor,
this isn’t right. We know for a
fact that file was not there.
JUDGE
BSB versus Ballard.
FRANK GREENE
I was there. I know there was no
proof of publication.
(to his lawyer)
You, you know it wasn’t there.
(to Judge)
My... my wife and kids are here. Do
you see them? My wife, my children?
INT. DENNIS’ NEW HOME - DAY
Dennis enters. He looks around. At the pool.
Nobody is there.
He goes upstairs. Getting more concerned.
DENNIS
Connor?
Moves to the bedroom.
DENNIS
Mom? Connor? Connor?!
Nobody is there.
Dennis dials his phone. RINGING. RINGING. Voicemail.
He breaks down. Lynn and Connor are gone.
INT. DENNIS’ NEW HOME - NIGHT
Dennis drunkenly plays with Connor’s basketball, his phone
next to the gun.
He drinks from the whiskey bottle.

93.

INT. DENNIS’ NEW HOME - SUNRISE
Sunlight hits Dennis, passed out and alone in the large,
empty living room.
RING. RING. He wakes up from a nightmare. Grabs his phone.
It’s not his family.
DENNIS (INTO PHONE)
Hi Rick INT. RICK'S BMW SUV - CONTINUOUS
INTERCUT BETWEEN Rick AND DENNIS
Rick pulls up to Dennis’ home in his news BMW X6 SUV.
RICK CARVER (INTO PHONE)
Morning Donald Trump. I’m outside
your new mansion. Where are you?
Frank Greene’s eviction. Let’s go.
It hits Dennis like a punch in the gut.
RICK CARVER (INTO PHONE)
Hello? Dumb ass. You there?
INT. RICK'S BMW SUV [MOVING] - MORNING
Rick drives. Dennis sits.
RICK CARVER
There’s eight other homeowners that
we’re going to have to evict after
Greene. We need to make aggressive
cash-for-keys offers to them. We’ll
pay out of pocket if we have to.
But if they give me any flack Freeman’s boys and the court clerk,
baby. No big deal.
Dennis looks out the passenger window, tormented.
EXT. FRANK GREENE’S HOME - CONTINUOUS
A boiling-hot day. Sheriffs, Jeff and crew wait outside
Greene’s home. NEIGHBORS across the street.
Rick and Dennis arrive. They approach Sheriff #1 who’s
speaking with FRANK’S NEIGHBOR.

94.

While they talk, Dennis stares at Frank’s home and sees Frank
peering at them from behind his living room window curtain.
FRANK’S NEIGHBOR #1
... She’s a worried wreck saying
Frank hasn’t slept in days. That
he’s up all night on the internet RICK CARVER
Excuse me, ma’am. - Bobby. Let’s
get this show on the road.
SHERIFF #1
Morning Rick. Possible trouble with
the tenant - Mr. Greene. Seems he
and his wife FRANK’S NEIGHBOR #1
Even last night we heard him
yelling RICK CARVER
Ma’am. Thank you. We’re not
marriage counselors.
(to Sheriff)
Let’s get cooking.
SHERIFF #1
Small problem; he may be armed.
Dennis takes this in.
RICK CARVER
Well go find out, Bobby.
SHERIFF #1
I’ll call back up and check it out.
Dennis squints his eyes in the bright sun and looks at Frank
behind the curtain.
DENNIS
Is his family in there with him?
NEIGHBOR FRIEND #1
Oh, yes. She was at my door this
morning crying before he called her
back inside. The kids didn’t go to
school either.
They all stare at the house.
SHERIFF #1
Alright, I’m going to check it out.

95.

RICK CARVER
Thanks for the play by play. Hurry
up.
Sweat falls over Dennis’ eyes. He wipes it as he watches the
two Sheriffs walk towards Frank’s house.
Then Dennis sees Frank raising something towards them.
Dennis realizes what’s about to happen. It’s fast. And loud.
SMASH, SMASH
Frank Greene smashes the window and raises a Remington
Woodmaster 742 semi-automatic 30.06 rifle out of his home.
Neighbors and Crew run for cover, SCREAMING.
Frightened, Rick pulls Dennis behind his SUV.
FRANK GREENE
I don’t want to hurt anyone. Please
get back. All of you. You’re
trespassing. I don’t want to hurt
anyone, but this is my home. Get
off my property.
RICK CARVER
(to Dennis)
Where’s your gun?! You don’t have
it?!
SHERIFF #1
Sir, put the weapon down!
FRANK GREENE
You’re trespassing!
Frank fires TWO SHOTS at the grass.
Sheriffs run behind their cruisers and pull their guns.
SHERIFF #2
Shots fired, shots fired!
Dennis punches the side of Rick’s SUV.
DENNIS
Fuck, fuck!
FRANK GREENE
I am not going to leave here!
Dennis hears Frank’s Wife and kids crying for him to stop.

96.

I/E. FRANK GREENE’S HOME - CONTINUOUS
Frank motions his wife and kids to get back.
FRANK GREENE
Go to the bedroom. Don’t stand
there! Get in the bedroom, now!
Sheriff #1 points his gun at Frank.
SHERIFF #1
Sir, put the gun down!
Frank points the weapon out the window again.
FRANK GREENE
God damn it, stop it! Put that
down, put it down, now!
SHERIFF #1
Not gonna happen, sir!
Frank hides out of view again.
SHERIFF #1
Sir, why don’t you send your wife
and kids out?
Dennis sees Frank staring out at what he’s done.
Police car arrives. Two POLICEMEN jump out with guns, asking
for update.
SHERIFF #2
Sir, drop your weapon!
Silence for a moment.
FRANK GREENE
The courts decided my fate in 60
seconds flat. Nobody checked the
file index. Fact. No proof of
publication filed. Fact. Nobody
looked at my cancelled checks that
prove payment to the bank. Fact.
The judge was retired, not up for
re-election and not beholden to the
citizens of this county. A lifetime
in 60 seconds and this is my home.
FRANK’S SON
Dad!

97.

Frank turns to him and the gun goes off accidentally shooting
a box of files. They SCREAM. Frank is horrified.
FRANK GREENE
Get in the bedroom!
Dennis hears this.
DENNIS
Fuck! No, no!
He looks at Rick, inches from him. They’ve never been this
close. Rick breaths hard, sweats; he’s scared.
Rick notices a shift in Dennis and squints his eyes.
RICK CARVER
... No.
Dennis rips his arm free, gets up from behind the SUV and
walks to the lawn.
Rick tries to stop him, but is frightened.
RICK CARVER
Dennis!
SHERIFF #1
Get back! Do not approach the
house!
RICK CARVER
Do something! What the hell are you
waiting for?!
Dennis ignores Rick and the Sheriffs’ PLEAS and walks towards
Frank’s home.
FRANK GREENE
Stop! Get off my property. Please
get back or I’m going to shoot. I
will shoot you.
Frank points the rifle and Dennis stops walking.
FRANK GREENE
I’m not going to leave my home. Get
off my lawn.
DENNIS
This is your home, this is your
property Frank, I know! Please put
that down.

98.

FRANK GREENE
The banks made more money last year
than anytime in the history of
human civilization. Fact. Fact.
Sounds of sirens.
Dennis glances behind and sees police cars, fire trucks and
ambulances arrive.
DETECTIVES and COPS in bullet proof vests spill out.
FRANK GREENE
I have the right to shoot anyone
who steps foot on my property. You
are trespassing. Get off or I will
shoot. I don’t want to do this.
DENNIS
Frank please put it down and let
your family out, please!
FRANK GREENE
Look up there. Look. Look up there.
Do you see that? Look!
Dennis looks up. The sun glares in his eyes.
FRANK GREENE
That is the sun and it is shining.
You can’t tell me it’s night when I
know it’s day. Even if God came
down here and said it was night, I
know it’s day. I know what I know,
and nobody can tell me the sun
isn’t shining. Nobody.
Dennis and Frank’s eyes are locked. And Dennis’ mouth opens:
DENNIS
I cheated you. I put a forged
document in your file the morning
of your case.
Frank takes this in. He is not surprised.
Detectives, sheriffs, cops, neighbors all hear Dennis’ words.
Rick stares with wonder and fear at Dennis.
DENNIS
This is your home.
Frank and Dennis stare at each other.

99.

Rick and everyone waits with wonder.
Frank lowers his rifle. Then tosses it out the window.
FRANK GREENE
I’m coming out.
He opens the door and steps out of the home with his hands
high.
POLICE
Get on your knees. Now. Hands
behind your head. Lie down.
Dennis watches Frank get on his knees, then lie down.
Police advance, guns pointed, knee to his back, handcuff him.
Dennis sees Police escort Frank’s frightened family out of
the home to safety.
Two Detectives approach Dennis and talk with him.
He points at Rick.
Rick watches the Detectives escort Dennis towards him.
Rick smiles and taps Dennis on the shoulder.
RICK CARVER
You did a hell of a thing, son. A
hell of a thing.
DETECTIVE
Excuse me, sir. Are you the bank’s
realtor?... Sir?
Dennis and Rick stare at each other. HOLD.
RICK CARVER
(to Dennis)
Thank you.
Dennis stares at Rick’s steely eyes. Did he mean it?
DETECTIVE
Sir? Are you Rick Carver?
RICK CARVER
Yes, I am.
DETECTIVE
We need to speak with you.

100.

Dennis and Rick look at each other for one last moment before
the Police take Dennis away. Rick puts on his sunglasses.
I/E. DETECTIVE’S CAR / FRANK GREENE’S HOME - CONTINUOUS
The Detective seats Dennis in the car and is called away.
Dennis is alone.
He looks out the back window and sees Rick trying to grab
Sheriff #2 by the shoulder to talk, but the Sheriff brushes
him off and quickly walks away.
Alone, Rick gets on his phone, calling someone, pacing.
Dennis sees the Detectives approaches Rick who gets off the
phone. They begin questioning him.
Dennis then sees Franks’s son outside the car.
Frank’s son looks at him, smiles, and runs away to a better
future.

THE END
