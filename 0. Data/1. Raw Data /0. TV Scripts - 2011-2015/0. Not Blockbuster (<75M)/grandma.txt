INT. ELLE’S APARTMENT - DAY

1

An apartment filled with books and art.
ELLE lives here. She is 70 years old, beautiful, and
extremely wilful.
There is nothing of the old lady about her.
and magnetic and smart.

She is selfish

With her this morning is Olivia, an attractive thirty five
year old woman who has been Elle’s lover for the last few
months.
Olivia is visibly upset. Elle seems much calmer.
around her place, neatening up.

She moves

OLIVIA
It’s not that I don’t love you.
Elle puts a teapot into a cupboard. Inside is a cap from an
academic’s cap and gown.
ELLE
What the hell’s this doing in here?
OLIVIA
These last four months have been
the...
Olivia is trying not to cry.
OLIVIA (CONT’D)
The last four months have been some
of the best months of my life.
ELLE
Well. It’s been a short life.
Comparatively.
OLIVIA
I’ve learned - I’ve learned so much
from you ELLE
Yes, I’m very wise.
Olivia knuckles her eye.
ELLE (CONT’D)
Very wizened.
OLIVIA
You’re not wizened.

2
Elle puts the medieval looking cap into a closet next to a
professor’s striped red academic gown.
OLIVIA (CONT’D)
You’re beautiful.
ELLE
Hah. So what have you learned,
exactly? Aside from backgammon?
(re gown)
There’s a rip in this Goddam thing.
OLIVIA
I’ve learned...not to buy into the
system. I’ve learned persistence.
Courage. Dedication to one’s
craft. In the face of...
ELLE
All reason?
OLIVIA
You’re still a wonderful poet.
ELLE
(with self-contempt)
I’m not a poet, I’m an academic.
An unemployed one OLIVIA
You should send the new poems to
your editor ELLE
She has dementia. So she might
actually like ‘em. Look, are you
breaking up with me or giving me a
pep talk here? Stick with the
narrative.
OLIVIA
Please. Elle ELLE
We always knew...
OLIVIA
We always knew what?
ELLE
I mean, you’re your age, and I’m...
rapidly approaching fifty.
Olivia smiles.

3
ELLE (CONT’D)
What was gonna happen here? You
don’t need a crystal ball or
anything.
OLIVIA
Do you love me?
(pause)
Are you in love with me?
Christ.

ELLE
Here. Blow your nose.

She hands Olivia a tissue.

Olivia blows her nose.

OLIVIA
You’ve never said it.
ELLE
“It is a tale full of sound and
fury, signifying nothing.”
OLIVIA
What is, love?
ELLE
...I’m gonna vacuum.
OLIVIA
Doesn’t love conquer everything?
No.

ELLE

Elle involuntarily glances up at a photo on the wall.
The photo is of a striking-looking woman (named Violet),
taken in the late eighties.
The woman looks into the camera, out at Elle.
ELLE (CONT’D)
No. It does not conquer
everything.
(pause)
Four months. We were together for
four months. Try thirty-eight
years. Try being with someone for
thirty-eight years.
(pause)
You’re a footnote.

4
OLIVIA
“A footnote?” That’s...that’s a
horrible thing to say.
ELLE
Well. I’m a horrible person.
(pause)
I’m gonna take a shower before I
vacuum. You can let yourself out.
OLIVIA
I guess that’s it.

Okay.
Yup.

ELLE
That’s it.

They stand there a moment.
Then Olivia comes over and kisses Elle.
Goodbye.
Elle is statue-like.

OLIVIA
Doesn’t reciprocate.

ELLE
Leave the key on the coffee table.
Elle goes off.
Olivia stands there a moment, numb.
Then she leaves.

INT. SHOWER - DAY

2

Water goes on.
Water hits Elle’s face.
From behind Elle’s head, we see the top of a large TATTOO on
Elle’s back - a COLORFUL DRAGONFLY. Elle’s shoulders begin
to SHAKE as she starts to cry.
Her fists clench.
She pounds the wall of the shower.
CUT TO: Elle is at the sink, brushing her teeth vigorously.
She bares her teeth at the mirror.

INT. ELLE’S APARTMENT - DAY

Elle is sitting on the floor, wearing her striped academic
gown and cap.
There are photos spread out on the floor in front of her. A
photo of her standing at the podium at a graduation ceremony,
in her gown. Photos of her with the woman on the wall, at a
poetry event in a cafe, at various stages in life. With a
little girl - her daughter.
The DOORBELL rings.
She looks up quickly.

Her breath catches.

INT. ELLE’S APARTMENT - DAY

Elle opens the door.
Standing there is a young woman.

Age 18.

This is her granddaughter, SAGE.
She is pretty.

Her nails are raggedly bitten.

ELLE
(surprised)
Sage.
Sage stands in the hallway, shifting on her toes.

Nervous.

SAGE
Hi Grandma.
Hi.

ELLE
Come in.

Thanks.

SAGE

Sage comes in. Elle glances out into the hall before she
closes the door.
ELLE
What are you doing here?
SAGE
Thought I’d drop by.
ELLE
Did you call?

6
SAGE
No. I just wanted to see you.
are you dressed like that?

Why

ELLE
Oh I’m just sitting here being
maudlin. You want some tea?
Sage nods.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Elle makes them tea.
SAGE
I need some help, Grandma.
Okay.

ELLE

Elle looks at Sage, who doesn’t say anything.
ELLE (CONT’D)
What’s going on?
Sage doesn’t say anything.
ELLE (CONT’D)
I’m not a mind-reader.
SAGE
I need six-hundred dollars.
hundred and thirty.
For what?

Six-

ELLE

SAGE
I’m pregnant.
Elle takes a couple of cups from the cupboard behind Sage.
Okay.

ELLE

SAGE
I don’t want to have a baby.
(stares into her tea)
I want to get an abortion. And I’m
broke. I have eighteen dollars.
(pause)
You think that’s terrible?

7
ELLE
Which part of it?
All of it.

SAGE

ELLE
It’s nothing to dance a jig about.
Have you told your mother?
SAGE
Mom? She’d have a stroke. She’d
start strangling me, and then she’d
have a stroke.
She demonstrates this.
She drops her pantomime.
ELLE
Well, she’d strangle you alright.
The kettle WHISTLES.
5A

EXT. ELLE’S TERRACE - DAY

5A

Sage and Elle have tea.
SAGE
I’m such an idiot.

Such an idiot.

ELLE
So was I, when I was your age.
SAGE
What am I gonna do?
gonna do?

What am I

ELLE
You already said what you’re gonna
do. Right? I mean you’ve put some
thought into this.
(pause)
Have you?
Sage nods.
ELLE (CONT’D)
Cause this is something you will
probably think about at some moment
each day for the rest of your life.

8
SAGE
Uhm...
(pause)
Do you have it?

Do you have money?

ELLE
Honey, at the moment, I have fortythree dollars.
SAGE
Forty-three dollars!
joking!

You’re

ELLE
I’m not. That’s what I have until I
get a check end of next week.
SAGE
How do you have so little money?
ELLE
I got sick of being in debt, so I
just paid it all off. Every cent I
still owed. Wanted to get that
weight off my back. I mean I still
had hospital bills from Vi. Twentyseven thousand dollars worth.
SAGE
Why didn’t you ask mom to help?
ELLE
Why don’t you?
Sage doesn’t answer.
ELLE (CONT’D)
I don’t need help. I’m sweeping
the decks clean here. Next week
I’m supposed to get a check for
some guest lectures I gave at Santa
Cruz. I had it all planned out.
SAGE
Well do you have a credit card?
ELLE
I cut my credit cards into little
pieces.
(points)
Look, I made a wind chime out of
them.

9

What?!

SAGE
Why would you do that?

ELLE
I was transmogrifying my life into
art.
SAGE
What kind of adult doesn’t have a
credit card!
ELLE
Credit cards infantilize you. They
turn you into a pod person. Come
on, you must have a credit card SAGE
Mom confiscated it after I crashed
the car in the garage. Shit!
Shit!
ELLE
Alright. Alright. Calm down.
We’re gonna deal with this.
We are?

SAGE

ELLE
(beat)
Yes. We are. Where’d you get this
630 dollar number?
SAGE
I went by a clinic.
Rapids.
Christ.

Called Pine

ELLE

SAGE
I have an appointment for the
procedure.
For when?

ELLE

SAGE
Five-forty-five.
ELLE
Five-forty-five? You mean today?
(Sage nods)
It’s 9 o’clock already!

10
SAGE
They don’t have another appointment
open this week! And I can’t wait.
I feel sick. And every day, every
day that goes by...
ELLE
Okay well, I know a women’s health
clinic where you can get one for
free.
You do?

SAGE

ELLE
Yeah, Vi used to volunteer there.
Let’s go.

EXT. PARKING AREA - DAY

Elle brushes some leaves off the tarp covering a car. She
pulls the tarp off, revealing a 1955 Dodge Royal Lancer.
SAGE
You still have Vi’s car?
ELLE
Course I still have Vi’s car.
Give me a hand, would you?
Sage helps her.
Elle puts the tarp in the trunk.
Elle starts the car.
Shit.

Only it doesn’t start.
ELLE (CONT’D)

LATER
A young man is giving Elle a jump start with some cables from
his truck.
ELLE (CONT’D)
I didn’t wake you up, did I?

No.

The young man glances at Sage.

She’s already pregnant.

The car pulls out.

EXT. CAR - DAY

Elle stops the car in the mini mall. She squints out the
window.
ELLE
Where the hell is it?
SAGE
I don’t know. When’s the last time
you were here?
ELLE
I dunno. 10 years ago? It must
have moved.
(points)
I think that was it. It was right
in there. Where that coffee place
is. Christ. It musta closed down.
(pause)
I could use some coffee.

INT. CAFE - DAY

They are drinking coffee in a cafe. Elle is at the

a table.

It

ELLE
How could they close this place
down? Why didn’t they let us know?
We could have had a rally!
Course...five years ago, we weren’t
going to any rallies.
(drinks coffee)
This is bilgewater. So where do
you get a reasonably priced
abortion? All you can get nowadays
is this shitty coffee.
SAGE
Yeah, Grandma, uh Sage is looking nervously at a conservative looking couple at
the next table. Elle puts more sugar into her coffee.
ELLE
How far along are you again?
When was your last period?
SAGE
Ten weeks ago.
The manager of the coffee bar is looking at Elle.
ELLE
My last period was twenty five
years ago. We did a ceremony for
it, Vi and I.
(pause)
600 dollars for an abortion! What
the hell! That’s highway robbery!
The manager comes over.
CAFE MANAGER
I’m sorry, but I’m going to have to
ask you to leave.
Excuse me?

ELLE

CAFE MANAGER
I’m going have to ask you to leave.

13
ELLE
You’re “going to have to?” When
are you “going to have to” ask us
to leave?
CAFE MANAGER
I’m going to have to ask you to
leave now.
ELLE
So you mean you are asking us to
leave.
CAFE MANAGER
Yes, you’re disturbing the
customers.
ELLE
What customers? I’m a customer.
Do you know what a customer is?
CAFE MANAGER
I know what a customer is.
ELLE
A customer is someone who pays for
your services. So I’m a customer.
What other customer are we
disturbing? Them? Ozzie and
Harriet over here?
Yes.

CAFE MANAGER

ELLE
We’re disturbing you.
right?

Isn’t that

CAFE MANAGER
Yes. That’s right. You are also
disturbing me.
ELLE
Because I’m talking about
abortions?
CAFE MANAGER
Yes. That’s right. Now please
take your coffee and enjoy it
somewhere else.
ELLE
This used to be an abortion clinic,
do you know that?
(MORE)

14
ELLE (CONT'D)
Where you are standing right now,
there were countless unintended
pregnancies terminated.
The nearby woman GASPS.
CAFE MANAGER
Please leave. Leave now.
ELLE
Wait, I’m going to enjoy this three
dollar “drip” coffee first! I’ve
got news for you - all coffee
drips! So you don’t have to call
it “drip” coffee - that’s a
redundancy! Hey, look, it’s
dripping!
Elle POURS THE REST OF HER COFFEE ON THE FLOOR.
ELLE (CONT’D)
I enjoyed that! That was some good
drip coffee!
SAGE
(to manager)
I’m sorry!
ELLE
Why should you be sorry?
be sorry!

He should

They go to the door.

She stops walking.

INT. CAFE - DAY

11

The manager looks up from where he is mopping up coffee.
ELLE
Here, lemme help you with that.
CAFE MANAGER
No, that’s alright ELLE
I insist, I feel terrible.
Elle grabs some napkins and gets down to help him mop the
spill.
ELLE (CONT’D)
So, do you need a key to use the
bathroom or is it unlocked?
He stares at her.
12

EXT. CAFE - DAY

Elle joins Sage outside the cafe.
ELLE
Okay, everyone’s friends now. So

One night stand?

No. He’s kind of my boyfriend.

ELLE
You don’t know? Well who does
know? If you don’t know.
SAGE
He was supposed to get the money by
this morning.
ELLE
What happened?
SAGE
He didn’t get it. He told me he
would. But he didn’t.
ELLE
Alright, well. This is his problem
too.
(stops)
You understand that, right?
Sage nods.
ELLE (CONT’D)
Understand that?

Do you?

SAGE
Yeah. Of course, he’s not the one
who’s pregnant.
ELLE
Well that’s the fucking problem
right? He’s not the one who’s
pregnant. He’d be shitting his
pants if he were. He’d find the
fucking money if he was about to
swell up like he swallowed a
watermelon.
I guess.

SAGE

ELLE
Let’s go talk to him.
SAGE
Who, Cam? I don’t know if that’s a
good idea.
“Cam?”

His name is “Cam?”

SAGE
Are your parents here?
No.

CAM

SAGE
So can we come in?
CAM
Whatever, yeah.
They come in.

The house is messy.

Cramped.

SAGE
Umm, you were supposed to get the
money.
CAM
I couldn’t get it. That fuckin
asshole wouldn’t front me the
money. I thought he would.
ELLE
Well you’re gonna have to get it,
Cam. Half. Give us half the
money.
CAM
Who is this?
SAGE
My grandmother.
CAM
Grandma? Yo Grandma, what you

ELLE
Listen, you have to take
responsibility for this.

He has a hockey

18
CAM
How do I know it was me?
SAGE

WHAT?

He picks up a hockey stick, starts messing with a piece of
balled up tape.
CAM
You heard me.
SAGE
I didn’t sleep with anyone else.
CAM
You slept with Mike.
Last year.

SAGE
He used a condom.

ELLE
Why didn’t you use a condom?
What’d it, slip off?
What?

CAM
What’d she say?

SAGE
She didn’t say anything CAM
Look, she said it wasn’t her time.
ELLE
Her time? What are you, a moron?
Are you both morons? Don’t they
teach kids sex-ed anymore?
Cam puts down the hockey stick.

Points at Elle.

CAM
Listen Grandma, you better watch
yourself.
ELLE
Look at this loser. You know, some
people shouldn’t grow beards
because it makes their face look
like an armpit.
SAGE
(laughs involuntarily)
Grandma!

19
CAM
I’m serious, old lady, don’t fuck
with me!
ELLE
Then give us the money!
CAM
I don’t have the money, bitch!

Let’s go, Grandma ELLE
“Bitch?” Look, you have the money,

What the fuck?

Get the God damn money!

Get out of my home! I mean it, you
old bitch! Get out! Or I’ll fuck

ELLE
You’ll fuck me up?
Let’s go!

SAGE

CAM
I will, I’ll fuck you up.
Instead of going to the door, Elle grabs the hockey stick and
HITS Cam with it. HARD in the HEAD.
He goes down, CRUMPLING to the ground.
SAGE SCREAMS.
CAM (CONT’D)
(groans)
Uuh Elle HITS him again, in the RIBS this time.
CAM (CONT’D)
Oh God, oh God - you hit me -

20
ELLE
I’ll hit you again, “bitch!”
SAGE

No!

Elle is sitting in her car, smoothing out and counting
crumpled bills.
It’s mostly ones.
Sage is in the passenger seat.
ELLE
I like your boyfriend. He’s
special. Really charismatic. I
can see how you’d be attracted to
him.
Sage doesn’t say anything.
Elle opens a little baggie with some buds of weed in it and a
small pack of rolling papers.
ELLE (CONT’D)
This was in his sock drawer too.
Smells pretty good. Red hairs.
Sage gets out of the car.

You’re crazy!

Mom’s right!

ELLE
Why, cause I rapped that little
shit across the knuckles?!
SAGE
Everyone’s gonna talk about it!
ELLE
He’s not gonna tell people. What’s
he gonna say? “Sage’s grandmother
beat me up?”
SAGE
You could have killed him!
ELLE
Nah, I hit him in the hard part of
his head. Stop! Stop...
Sage walks a few steps more, then leans over and gags,
throwing up a little.
ELLE (CONT’D)
Are you okay?
SAGE
No! I’m not okay! I’m pregnant!
I’m fucking pregnant!
Elle puts her hand on Sage’s back.

Sage stands up, wiping

SAGE (CONT’D)
You have an anger problem!
ELLE
No, I have an asshole problem.
When people are assholes, it makes
me angry. Especially if they’re
being assholes to my granddaughter.
They stand there a moment.

22
ELLE (CONT’D)
Look. We gotta get going here. We
have to get like 550 dollars still.
(pause)
Come on. There’s someone who owes
me four hundred bucks. Maybe she
has it. Let’s go.

Or you could just call your mom and
ask her for the money.
Sage thinks about it.

Elle is pensive.
ELLE
So your mom says I’m crazy?
SAGE
You know that. You know mom thinks
you’re crazy. She thinks I’m crazy
too.
ELLE
You’re not crazy enough.
SAGE
What does that mean?
ELLE
Just an impression.
(pause)
You need to be able to say “screw
you” sometimes.
SAGE
I say “screw you.”
ELLE
You didn’t say screw you to that
little creep back there.
SAGE
...No, I guess not.

Misanthropic.

At the front of the store a man is getting an elaborate

The tattoo artist calls out over her shoulder.

Now I feel

ELLE
Hey, could I have that four-hundred
dollars?
DEATHY
Oh God, Elle. Really?
ELLE
Yeah, I need it.
Oh.

She’s pregnant.

DEATHY
She needs a “Bortion,” hunh?

Yeah.
Jesus.

ELLE
She needs a “Bortion.”
SAGE
Stop it.

DEATHY
We used to have this schtick where
this girl needed a “Bortion.” Like
she didn’t know it was called “an
abortion.” She thinks it’s called
“a Bortion.”
SAGE
A “schtick?” That’s horrible.
ELLE
It is, kind of. So do you have
that money, honey? Do you?
DEATHY
Christ, I wish I did. Your Grandma
really helped me out, a while ago.

DEATHY (CONT'D)
I had these defective boobs that
were leaking, just leaking silicone
down into my knees. It was awful.
Elle here came through for me. And
now you need me and I’m broke. I’m
fucking broke.

I can give you a tattoo. That I
can do. You want a tattoo,
darling?
What? No.

SAGE
Thank you. We have to

ELLE
How long would it take? For like a
little one?
DEATHY
Oh honey, not long. Fifteen
minutes? I’m a quick draw.
ELLE
Maybe it’d help me collect my
thoughts. We gotta strategize
here.
LATER
The needle is BUZZING.
Elle is getting a tattoo, a simple O tattooed on her
shoulder.
DEATHY
Don’t you have any rich friends?
What about Deanne and Margot?
ELLE
I kind of gave them hell last time
I saw them. Cause they just
disappeared when Vi got ill. Along
with everyone else.
DEATHY
What about all your academic pals?
ELLE
They’re all broke and stingy. And
they’re all in Santa Cruz. We need
the money now.

26
SAGE
What’s O for?
ELLE
That’s not an O. It’s a circle.
It was the quickest one.
SAGE
Looks like an O.
DEATHY
I thought it was for orgasm.
ELLE
Yeah, sure, it’s for that.
SAGE
It’s not for “Olivia?”
Elle’s face tightens.
SAGE (CONT’D)
Isn’t Olivia the name of your
girlfriend? Can’t you ask her for
money?
ELLE
I don’t have a girlfriend.
SAGE
Mom said you did. She said you had
a girlfriend called Olivia.
ELLE
I knew I shouldn’t tell your mother
anything.
Why not?

SAGE

ELLE
Because she’s so judgemental.
“Judge Judy.”
SAGE
Yeah. “Judge Judy.”
(pause)
You have a violet tattoo, right?
For Aunt Violet?
Yes.

ELLE
That I do.

27
DEATHY
You ever see her dragonfly?
that!

I did

SAGE
Yeah, it’s badass.
Deathy works.
SAGE (CONT’D)
Do you miss her? Violet?
ELLE
I miss her all the time.
DEATHY
That was a great love story, you
and Vi. Course she put up with a
lot.
ELLE
What does that mean?
DEATHY
Nothing, darling, just you’re not
the easiest toke. But that’s why I
love you. So what is the O for?
ELLE
O’s a big letter for women. You
got “Ovaries.” Origami. Openness.
Orifice.
Cheeri-os.
Oven.

DEATHY

ELLE
Old. Odd.

Olivia.
Whatever.

Ossuary.

Out.

SAGE
ELLE
Yeah.

As it happens.

Elle purses her lips.
Done!

DEATHY

LATER
By the register. Elle is patting her tattoo with some cotton
with bacitracin on it.

28
ELLE
How much do you think first

DEATHY
First editions of what?
stuff?
My stuff?
anything.

Of your

ELLE
Those aren’t worth

SAGE
But you’re famous.
ELLE
No, I was marginally well-known.
Forty years ago. But I have some
valuable first editions. Betty
Friedan. I got a couple of signed
Simone de Beauvoir books. Carla
wanted them.
DEATHY
Who’s Carla?
ELLE
You know, she owns the Bonobo cafe.
ELLE (CONT’D)
I’m gonna sell my God damned first
editions. They’re probably worth a
few thousand, but I’ll give her a
break. What the hell am I hanging
onto them for anyway? See Sage, I
told you this’d clear my head.
DEATHY
(to Sage)
Hey, darling, here’s thirty-five
bucks. It all adds up.
(looks over)
And here’s another thirty I’m just
gonna borrow from the register.

INT. ELLE’S APARTMENT - DAY
Back to Elle’s apartment.
Elle and Sage enter. Elle goes to her answering machine.
There are two messages.
Elle presses the answering machine button.

ANSWERING MACHINE
You have two messages. First
message, sent today at 11:03.
The first message is a hang-up.
ANSWERING MACHINE (CONT’D)
Second message, sent today at
11:04.
The second message is a hang-up too.
Elle bites her cheek.

Stares at the answering machine.

She looks over. Sage is leaning over the sink, retching a
bit, spitting saliva.
ELLE
You alright?
Sage looks at her.
ELLE (CONT’D)
You want some ginger ale?
SAGE
I hate ginger ale.
ELLE
What? You love ginger ale. We
used to have these little tea
parties, only you didn’t like tea,
so we’d put ginger ale in the
teapot.
SAGE
(pause)
Okay. It’s almost 12:30.
ELLE
It’s gonna be alright.
HOW!

SAGE
HOW WILL IT BE ALRIGHT?

ELLE
It will. We’re gonna sell some
damn first editions. Here. Check
em out.
Elle has a shelf of old first editions, along with a number
of copies of books of poetry that she wrote.

30
ELLE (CONT’D)
That fuckin’ Carla is gonna go
apeshit for them. She was over
here for dinner once, she wanted to
buy them from me, right then.
Elle pulls a few books out.
Sage picks up The Feminine Mystique.
SAGE
What’s this?
ELLE
The Feminine Mystique?
Feminine Mystique?

What’s The

SAGE
Mystique’s a character in X-Men.
ELLE
What? What the hell are you
talking about?
SAGE
Want me to google how much it’s
worth?
ELLE
Yeah. Go ahead.
edition.

Signed first

SAGE
I’ll look it up on Ebay.
ELLE
Ebay, Google, whatever. The
Feminine Mystique by Betty Friedan.
You know The Wizard of Oz, when the
curtain gets pulled aside, and they
see the Wizard’s a fake? Cause
that dog, Toto pulls the curtain?
She was like Toto.
(pause)
Maybe not a great metaphor.
53.90.

SAGE

ELLE
Five thousand three hundred ninety
dollars?

31
SAGE
No, Fifty-three dollars and ninety
cents. There’s one on sale here on
Ebay for 53.90.
ELLE
Fifty-three dollars?!
bullshit!

That’s

SAGE
First edition, good condition,
fifty-three dollars ninety cents.
She shows Elle her phone.

Elle squints at it.

ELLE
How can you read that?
SAGE
There’s a stain on it.
wine?

Is this

ELLE
Yeah, wine. Probably. Shit. Well
I’m just gonna bring all these
things. Look at this. The Prime
of Life by Simone de Beauvoir.
This is her autobiography. Dare I
ask if you know who Simone de
Beauvoir is?
No idea.

SAGE
Guess I’m an idiot.

ELLE
Guess you are.
Sage looks like she’s been slapped.
SAGE
(mutters)
Screw you.
What?

ELLE
Couldn’t hear you.

SCREW YOU!
Not bad.

SAGE
SCREW YOU, GRANDMA!
ELLE

32
SAGE
You don’t even know who Mystique
is.
Elle laughs.

EXT. STREET BY CAFE - DAY

21

Elle and Sage get out of Elle’s car, both carrying a few
books.
They walk towards a cafe with a Bonobo Ape painted on the
window.
SAGE
So what’s a bonobo?
ELLE
A very advanced ape. The females
run the show, they masturbate all
the time, and they don’t have wars,
unlike chimps and humans.
SAGE
So you think women are better than
men?
ELLE
Men are okay. My father was a man.
SAGE
Mine wasn’t. He was a sperm.
ELLE
Donor. Your mom was busy. You
shouldn’t blame her for that. That
was a valid decision. At least
that sperm wasn’t a drunk. It never
blacked your eye cause you talked
back.
SAGE
I just wish she could have gotten
the sperm’s name. Only thing I
know is he must have had curly
hair.
She holds open the door for Elle.
22

INT. BONOBO CAFE - DAY
A feminist-themed coffee shop.

33
A woman with a white buzz-cut is hanging up a flyer.
ELLE

Hey.

CARLA
Hey! Hey stranger!
ELLE
I brought the books.
CARLA
What books?
ELLE
The books you wanted to buy from
me.
She puts books on a counter next to soy milk and almond milk
thermoses.
Oh.

CARLA
Okay, umm...

Carla glances towards the back of the cafe.
ELLE
Look. Feminine Mystique. First
edition, signed. This wine stain?
Was left by Betty Friedan herself.
Simone de Beauvoir. Germaine
Greer! The Female Eunuch! Got
some Eileen Myles here, for God’s
sake!
CARLA
Un-hunh, yeah...
ELLE
My granddaughter here googled them,
they’re worth thousands and
thousands of dollars.
Sage gives Elle a look.
Right?

ELLE (CONT’D)

SAGE
(lying)
...Yeah right.

34
ELLE
I’ll let you have em for fivehundred and fifteen dollars, but
it’s gottta be right now, cash.
Out from the kitchen comes Olivia, Elle’s (now ex) lover,
holding a plate with a quesadilla on it for a customer. She
has on an apron with a Bonobo ape on it.
She freezes upon seeing Elle.
OLIVIA
What are you doing here?
ELLE
What - what are you doing here?
You’re not supposed to be working
today!
OLIVIA
Laurel was sick. She asked me to
fill in. Jesus, what are you doing
here?
ELLE
I came to sell some stuff.
books.

These

Olivia recognizes the books.
OLIVIA
You’re gonna sell these?

Why?

ELLE
I need some cash.
OLIVIA
I told you not to cut up your
credit card!
A woman sitting at a table pipes up.
CUSTOMER
Is that my quesadilla?
Yes.

OLIVIA
Sorry.

Olivia brings the customer her quesadilla.
Elle tries to compose herself.

35
ELLE
Okay.
(to Carla)
Okay, you want to buy these or
what? You said you wanted to buy
them.
CARLA
Well, I don’t know.
think about it.

I have to

OLIVIA
(to customer, distracted)
You want - you want hot sauce?
CUSTOMER
You have Tabasco?
Tapatio.

OLIVIA
We have Tapatio.

Olivia is glancing over at Elle.
Sage is watching their interaction.
ELLE
Come on, do you want them or not?
CARLA
I’m thinking.
Olivia takes a deep breath and comes back over.
Hey.
Hey.

OLIVIA
ELLE

OLIVIA
Are you going to introduce me to
your granddaughter?
ELLE
Sure.
(turns)
Sage. Olivia.
Olivia.

SAGE
Hi.

OLIVIA
I’ve seen pictures of you.

36

Oh.

Cool.

SAGE

OLIVIA
Bit of a...surprise meeting you
like this.
Yeah...
Okay.

SAGE

OLIVIA
Wow. Well.

Fuck.

ELLE
(to Carla)
Well?
CARLA
Look, I’ll give you sixty dollars
for them.
ELLE
All of them?
OLIVIA
So you need money? Because ELLE
I do not need money from you.
Thank you.
Okay.

OLIVIA
‘Cause -

ELLE
Are you fucking kidding me?
you kidding me Olivia?

Olivia turns to Carla.
OLIVIA
(to Carla)
These books are worth more than
sixty dollars.
ELLE
I can do my own haggling.

Jesus,

OLIVIA
Well stop being so mean! Stop
being such a mean asshole! How
about that?

37
ELLE
Me? Mean? I’m not mean, I’m just
not a hypocrite!
OLIVIA
So I’m a hypocrite now?!
ELLE
(to Olivia)
Did you call me earlier? Did you
call me and hang up? Twice?
OLIVIA
(pause)
...Yes.
Why?

ELLE

OLIVIA
I don’t know. I don’t know why.
ELLE
You just want power. You want to
exert your dominance over me! You
want to be the Alpha Bonobo!
No!

OLIVIA

CARLA
Guys, take it outside.
Elle turns on Carla.
ELLE
And you! How come you don’t pay a
decent wage, you cheap asshole!
What?

CARLA

ELLE
You heard me! You call yourself a
feminist?! It should be illegal,
what you pay these kids!
OLIVIA
I’m not a kid ELLE
It probably is illegal! You’re not
a Bonobo, Carla! You’re a gorilla!
You’re a Silverback male gorilla!
(MORE)

38
ELLE (CONT'D)
And she is right! These books are
worth way more than sixty dollars!
SAGE
Grandma, let’s go!
ELLE
DON’T call me fucking GRANDMA!
SAGE
(pause)
What should I call you?
ELLE
(to Olivia)
GO BACK TO SCHOOL. Finish your
doctorate. Get your head out of
your ass! Stop working at this
dump!
CUSTOMER
Could I get that hot sauce please?
What?

OLIVIA

CUSTOMER
Sorry - hot sauce?
OLIVIA
Here. You want hot sauce?
want hot sauce?!!

You

She grabs some Tapatio and DUMPS IT ALL OVER THE WOMAN’S
QUESADILLA.
OLIVIA (CONT’D)
HOT ENOUGH FOR YOU?
ELLE
(laughs)
HAH! You’re really off the deep
end!
CARLA
That’s it!
(picks up books)
Take these. I don’t want them.
ELLE
Great and take your sixty bucks and
shove em up your ass.
Elle leaves.

39
SAGE
I’ll carry them.
Olivia follows.
23

EXT. STREET BY CAFE - DAY

23

Olivia comes out after Elle and yells.
OLIVIA
Why are you acting like these last
four months didn’t mean anything?!
Why?!
ELLE
Because they didn’t.
OLIVIA
I HATE you!
Great!

ELLE

OLIVIA
I WISH I’D NEVER MET YOU!
ELLE
You never did!
OLIVIA
Right, cause you never showed me
the real you, right?!
ELLE
That’s exactly right.
OLIVIA
WELL I’VE GOT NEWS FOR YOU, I SAW
THE REAL YOU, I SAW IT, YOU SELFISH
ASSHOLE! AND I STILL STUCK AROUND!
ELLE
Your medal’s in the mail.
OLIVIA
I’m returning it!
ELLE
You - you NEOPHYTE!
SOLIPSIST!

INT. CAR - DAY

They drive.
SAGE
You okay to drive?
ELLE
Fine.
(pause)
You can call me Grandma.
just I know.

That was

SAGE

SAGE (CONT’D)
Why’d she call you “writer in
residence?”
ELLE
...She’s calling me a sellout.
Cause that’s how I used to make
bread. You go someplace, a private
college, usually, cause they have
the money. You do some readings,
you teach some seminars, then you
leave, cause you don’t have tenure.
SAGE
How is that selling out?
ELLE
Well. It’s not “suffering for your
art.” But I had a kid.
(pause)
I used to drag your mother along
with me when she was little. Spent
a lot of time in cars, your mother
and me.
SAGE
Well...I’m learning some new
insults. My friends pretty much
just call each other “bitch” or
“ho.” “Slut.”

41
ELLE
Well that’s ignorant bullshit.
SAGE
(pause)
So do you think I’m one? A slut?
ELLE
(looks at her)
No. And I don’t want to hear you
use that word again.
(pause)
You know in the 14th century,
Chaucer used the word “sluttish” to
refer to an untidy man SAGE
(pause)
What’s that noise?
There’s a noise from the car.
ELLE
That’s the noise the car makes.
Let’s go buy a few dollars worth of
gas.
24A

EXT. REAR OF GAS STATION - DAY
Elle comes out from a gas station rest room.
SAGE
She’s pretty. Olivia.
ELLE
Yes, she’s pretty. That’s what it
means, “Olivia.” It means “most
beautiful.” So what was she doing
with me? Right?
No.

SAGE

ELLE
That’s what you were thinking.
It wasn’t.

SAGE
It wasn’t actually.

ELLE
She mailed me an essay she wrote
about my poetry. Asked if I’d have
coffee with her someday.
(MORE)

24A

42
ELLE (CONT'D)
Because I’m so vain, I said okay.
We met for coffee...she was cute.
And smart. And she just kept after
me. I did more writing in the last
four months than in the five year
before that.
(pause)
Anyway, that’s over.
SAGE
(pause)
Grandma, you got any other ideas?
ELLE
...I’m afraid I do.
25

EXT. HOUSE - DAY

Elle pulls up outside a house with an old motorcycle in front
of it. There’s a metal seesaw in the front lawn.
26

INT. CAR - DAY

26

Elle looks at the house.
What?

SAGE

ELLE
Nothing. Wait in the car
(pause)
On second thought, come with me.
The front door of the house opens. KARL steps onto the
porch. He’s about 70, muscular, with a pigtail.
Elle?

KARL

Elle gets out of the car.
Hi there.

ELLE
Hi Karl.

KARL
What a surprise to get your call.
ELLE
Well, it’s been too long.

43
KARL
Thirty years, Elle. Been thirty
years since we last saw each other.
ELLE
God, we’re thirty years older.
KARL
That’s how it works. It don’t go
backwards. Who’s the young lady?
ELLE
This is my granddaughter.
“Sage.”
Hi.

KARL
Nice name.

Sage.

Pungent.

SAGE

KARL
You want some zucchini?
ELLE
That’s alright.
(to Sage)
Do you?
SAGE
No thank you.
KARL
How about some corn.
some corn. Come on.
He goes into the house.

I just boiled

Elle and Sage follow him.

INT. KARL’S KITCHEN - DAY

Elle is eating some corn, looking at some framed photos on a
table. Sage hangs back.
KARL
(to Sage)
Sure you don’t want some corn?
SAGE
No thanks. I have...a bit of an
upset stomach.
ELLE
Who are these people?

44
KARL
My grandkids.
ELLE
You have grandkids now?
KARL
I do. You’re not the only one
allowed to have grandkids.
ELLE
Which wife is this?
KARL
That? Wife number four. Kid
number five. Grandkids number 9,
10 and 11.
ELLE
Jesus, you’re a patriarch.
I am.
corn?
Good.

KARL
I‘m biblical.

How’s the

ELLE

KARL
Those your own teeth you’re eating
with?
Yup.

ELLE

KARL
Good for you. You were always
worried about your teeth. You took
good care of them.
SAGE
She used to tell me - brush your
teeth or you’ll lose them.
KARL
Did she, Sage? You know, the teeth
are the only thing we see on a
person that’ll look the same when
they’re dead. When someone smiles
at you, they’re showing you their
skeleton.
SAGE
That’s creepy.

45
KARL

It is.

ELLE
Are you married now?
KARL
Right now, no. I am currently a
man about town.
Elle nods.
ELLE
Sage, would you let me talk to Karl
for a minute? Go look at the
flowers out back.
SAGE
I’ll go look at the flowers.
Sage goes out back.
KARL
Are you going to make me a marriage
proposal? Now that you know I’m
available?
ELLE
I was just wondering if a wife was
going to pop out from somewhere all
of a sudden. You want to smoke
some weed?
Karl laughs.
Sure.

KARL
Why not?

Elle starts to roll a joint from the bag she took from Cam’s
sock drawer.
KARL (CONT’D)
You mean business, hunh?

EXT. KARL’S HOUSE - DAY
Sage walks outside the house.

Elle lights the joint.

Didn’t know I’d be having a party
today. Care for a beer?
No thanks.

So how’s your partner?
Come on.

Daisy?

ELLE
Violet.

KARL
How’s Violet?
ELLE
She passed away. Two and a half
years ago. She’s dead.
I’m sorry.

Thanks. So listen, you told me if
I ever needed anything I should

Did I? Yes, I guess I did.

Well I need to borrow 500 dollars.

Karl takes the joint.

Hits on it, looking at her.

So you’re not just here to smoke a
joint with an old flame?
ELLE
Well sure I’m here for that.

But I

You must not have a lot of friends.
Current friends.

Guess not.

He passes her back the joint.
ELLE (CONT’D)
Look, you were always good with
money, I thought you might be able
to help me out.
KARL
What do you need it for?
ELLE
(exhales)
Rent.
KARL
Rent? Why don’t you ask your
daughter?
ELLE
We’re not speaking that often.
KARL
That’s too bad.
She passes him back the joint.
KARL (CONT’D)
(beat)
It’s painful seeing you, Elle.
Elle opens a beer.
ELLE
What the hell kind of a thing is
that to say?
KARL
I don’t know. Just popped into my
head. Maybe I’m getting soft.
Male menopause, maybe.
ELLE
You’re well past menopause.

We sure were. We sure were stupid.
ELLE
That’s an understatement.

Can you

KARL
Sure. I want something in return,
though.
What?

ELLE
What do you want?

A kiss.

KARL

ELLE
Like a peck?
KARL
No, like a real kiss.
ELLE
And then you’ll loan me the money?
Karl nods.
Alright.

ELLE (CONT’D)
Let’s get it over with.

She takes the joint from Karl. She takes a hit off it, then
she kisses him. It’s not passionate, but it has some
affection in it.
ELLE (CONT’D)
There you go. For old times’ sake.
KARL
Now I want you to make love with
me, just once. For old times’
sake.
ELLE
Go fuck yourself, Karl.
KARL
Not really interested in fucking
myself, Elle. I wish I was.

49
KARL (CONT'D)
I coulda kept out of a lot of
trouble over the years.
(pause)
Okay, well. I gotta go fix this
miniature jeep.
He goes out of the house.
HEY.

ELLE
WE HAD A DEAL!

Elle follows Karl out.
Sage watches her go out.
30

EXT. KARL’S HOUSE - DAY

Karl opens up a tool box. There is a kid’s-size purple jeep
lying on it’s side by the entrance.
ELLE
Come on, are you out of your mind?
He takes out some tools.
KARL
Why are you here?
ELLE
I told you. I’m here because I
need money.
Karl gets down by the jeep.
KARL
You wronged me.
ELLE
This again?
KARL
You were wrong, how you acted.
ELLE
Forty-nine years ago?
KARL
(nods)
Forty-nine years ago.
wrong.

You were

50
ELLE
Well, I was wrong to be sleeping
with you, given that I was a
lesbian.
KARL
You didn’t seem like a lesbian at
the time. When we were living on
the boat.
ELLE
Well I was. Just a confused one.
KARL
And that poem you wrote?
Ogre’s Seed?”

“The

ELLE
That wasn’t about you.
KARL
You’re sure you’re not here to say
you’re sorry? To apologize to me?
Finally?
ELLE
No. Afraid not. Man, you have
eleven grandkids! You can’t let go
of old shit?!
KARL
I find that, as I get older, old
shit just bubbles up. It bubbles
up from the tar. Don’t you find
that to be the case?
(pause)
Look, Elle, I’m not the one who
called up from out of nowhere.
You’re the one rattling the
skeletons here. So what are you
here for? WHAT ARE YOU HERE FOR?
ELLE
I’M HERE BECAUSE I NEED SOME GODDAM
MONEY, BECAUSE I’M THE ONLY IDIOT I
KNOW WHO WOULD CUT UP HER GOD DAMN
CREDIT CARD TO PROVE A POINT TO
HERSELF.
(Pause)
I knew I was dumb to come here,
because I knew you’d be the same
selfish bastard you always were.

Sage comes around the side of the house.
ELLE (CONT’D)
Okay, let’s go.
KARL
Wait! Wait - okay.

You can?

Okay. I can

KARL
I can help you. If you need help I
can help you. For old times sake.
Elle stands there.
KARL (CONT’D)
Five-hundred?
...Yes.
I have it.

ELLE
KARL
Hold on.

Karl goes inside.
Sage and Elle stand there. Inside the house, Karl goes over
to a bookcase and pulls out a thick old volume (where he
hides his cash).
SAGE
He’s not...
ELLE
Your grandfather? No. Your
grandfather was a fling. One night
stand. I have no idea where he is.
Karl’s a guy I married.
What?!

SAGE

ELLE
Yeah. We lived on a sailboat
together for two months. Then I
split. In the middle of the night.
SAGE
This was before Aunt Violet?

52
ELLE
Of course it was before Aunt
Violet.
Karl comes back out.

He has some cash in his hand.

KARL
Hey, so what’s it for?
money for, really?

What’s the

ELLE
I told you, it’s for rent.
KARL
Yeah, you told me that, but you’re
a shitty liar.
ELLE

It’s true. I am.
KARL
So what’s it for?
He turns to Sage.
It’s...
Yeah?

SAGE
KARL

ELLE
She needs to terminate a pregnancy.
She’s gonna have an abortion.

Karl pockets the money.
No.

KARL
No fuckin’ way.

Karl -

ELLE

KARL
Are you out of your mind? Are you
out of your God damn mind?
ELLE
Karl, come on KARL
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

53
ELLE
BECAUSE WE NEED THE MONEY!
KARL
GO TO HELL!
ELLE
Alright! Alright, Karl!
(pause)
I’m sorry! Alright? I am sorry.
I am not sorry that I did it. But
I am sorry that I didn’t tell you.
I am sorry I lied to you. That is
all I am sorry for. But I am sorry
for that.
KARL
It was my decision too!
ELLE
It’s my body. It’s always been my
body!
KARL
And then you go - you fucking go
and have a stranger’s baby? You’re
a psycopath!
ELLE
Well I wanted a baby. I just
didn’t want a God damn husband.
KARL
Right, so she grew up with no
father.
ELLE
She grew up fine.
KARL
Which is why you don’t speak to
her.
Elle sags a moment.
And you!

KARL (CONT’D)

He points to Sage.
KARL (CONT’D)
Does he know? The father?

54
SAGE
Yeah, he knows. He doesn’t want
it. He doesn’t care.
KARL
Okay. Well, at least he knows. At
least you had the human decency to
tell him. But I’m not paying for
it.
Karl goes back into his house.
KARL (CONT’D)
I’m not paying for that.
Sage and Elle stand there a moment.

Let’s go.

So you...you had an abortion?
Elle’s face fills with stress.
Yes.

ELLE
In someone’s basement.

SAGE
Was it a doctor?

Who did it?

ELLE
He claimed to have gone to medical
school. I don’t believe he ever
did.
SAGE
...Did it hurt?
Elle doesn’t answer.
SAGE (CONT’D)
So were you... you used to like
men?

55
ELLE
I always liked women.
(pause)
I just didn’t like myself.

After I had your mom, I knew it was
too painful. Life is too painful
not to be what you are.
Sage looks down.
SAGE
I don’t know...

You don’t know what?

You having second thoughts?

Sage laughs.
ELLE (CONT’D)
No, I mean it. The straight A’s.
The incessant violin practice. She
used to take my cigarettes and
empty out the tobacco and replace
it with Potpourri that she stole
from Vi’s closet. I’d light up and
get a lungful of potpourri.
SAGE
Why’d she do that?

Cause she wanted me to quit.

And she wanted to torture me.

Okay. Alright. I know...

there.
OLIVIA
(surprised)
Elle ELLE

Hi.

OLIVIA
What happened to you?
ELLE
Nothing. Some little girl punched
me.
OLIVIA

What?

ELLE
It was a karma boomerang.
I’m fine.

Anyway,

OLIVIA
Well come in.
ELLE
No, you have company.

Elle, these are my parents, Mike

ELLE

Jesus.
FRANCESCA

Hello.

ELLE
(beat)
Hi, I’m...I’m a friend of your
daughter.
MIKE
(strained)
We’ve heard a lot about you.
FRANCESCA
I enjoy your poetry.
You do.

ELLE
Thank you.

FRANCESCA
I read it when I was in college.
Of course.

ELLE

FRANCESCA
I was a Women’s Studies major.
ELLE
(beat)
Congratulations.
FRANCESCA
“Dragonfly” was one of my favorite
poems. “You bite my wings, attack
me, mid-flight...evolution’s
knife... held to my throat...”
ELLE
...Yes, that’s the one that gets
anthologized. Not my favorite,
honestly. On a technical level.

86
FRANCESCA
How come you stopped writing?
ELLE
Well...cause people stopped
reading.
Olivia comes back with a bag of ice.
Here.

OLIVIA

Olivia puts some ice on Elle’s eye.

Elle takes it from her.

ELLE
Thank you. It’s really...I already
put ice on it. But thank you.
Elle steps back.
ELLE (CONT’D)
I’m going to - I’m going to give
you all your privacy. I have a cab
waiting for me. Sorry to intrude,
I just - I came by to give you
these.
She gives Olivia the bag she brought.
Olivia looks.

The first edition books are inside it.

ELLE (CONT’D)
They’re first editions.
OLIVIA
I know what they are.

Of course. Well, goodbye.
Pleasure to meet you.

OLIVIA
Where are you going?
ELLE

Home.

OLIVIA
So, you just came here for that just to give me some books.
ELLE
No, no, that’s not all I came
for...
Elle looks at Olivia.
ELLE (CONT’D)
Course it meant something to me. I
loved being in love with you.
...I never thought I’d feel that
way again.
(pause)
You have a wonderful life ahead of
you. And that’s what I want for
you...I want you to have what I
had.
(beat)
It’s been a long day. I’d kind of
like to get home and do some
writing. You’d better go back in
and see if your parents need some
smelling salts or something.
Olivia laughs.

Elle smiles at her.

Elle steps forward and kisses her.
Okay, bye.
Okay.

They kiss.
