INT. LIPSKY’S WEST END AVE APT/LIVING ROOM/OFFICE - NYC 2008 - NIGHT

1

A bright, unpretentious two-bedroom in a pre-war building,
cluttered with books and papers, reflecting its owner’s
lively mind. The decor is that of a perennial grad student’s
digs, the bachelor pad of a New York intellectual.
A dog curled up on the sofa beside him, DAVID LIPSKY, a
boyishly handsome forty-three, quick-witted, tightly-wound,
smokes and types speedily from scraps of handwritten notes,
surrounded by books on his current journalistic subject,
climate change. A stack of copies of his recent publishing
success - Absolutely American - looms nearby.
His iPhone vibrates.

He gets up and answers the call.

LIPSKY
Hey, Bob, what’s up?
BOB’S VOICE
(over phone) Listen: According to
this unconfirmed report... David
Wallace is dead.
LIPSKY
(disputing) What? No no no no, must
be a college prank or something...
Lipsky rapidly googles “david foster wallace death” and scans
the news.
BOB’S VOICE
I thought if anybody knew whether it
was true or not...
Shock registers on Lipsky’s face.
SIEGEL.

OVER: NPR reporter ROBERT

ROBERT SIEGEL (O.S.)
Now a remembrance of writer David
Foster Wallace...

INT. NPR - NYC - 2008 - DAY
Lipsky is being escorted to a booth by a college-age INTERN.
ROBERT SIEGEL (O.S.) (CONT’D)
He was found dead, an apparent
suicide, on Friday night. Wallace's
novel, "Infinite Jest," brought him
fame and a wide audience.

Lipsky, wearing headphones, heart pounding, nervously waits
for a cue from a woman producer in the control booth.
ROBERT SIEGEL (O.S.)
...Writer David Lipsky has this
appreciation.
The producer signals to Lipsky, who reads his prepared
remarks from his shaky hands.
LIPSKY
“To read David Foster Wallace was to
feel your eyelids pulled open.

EXT. BOOKSTORE - NYC - 2008 - DAY

Lipsky, pensive, smoking, walks down the street on a crisp
autumn day, stops at a window display honoring Wallace with
his picture and copies of his books The Broom of the System,
Brief Interviews with Hideous Men, A Supposedly Fun Thing
I’ll Never Do Again and his magnum opus, Infinite Jest.
LIPSKY (V.O.)
Some writers specialize in the awayfrom-home experience. They’ve
safaried, eaten across Italy, covered
a war. Wallace offered his alive
self...

INT. LIPSKY’S WEST END AVE APT/CLOSET - NYC - 2008 - DAY
Lipsky rummages closet shelves until he locates a particular
shoe box labeled “DFW.” He opens the box: inside are a
motley bunch of audio tapes - eight or nine of them numbered, scrawled with dates from four days in March 1996.
LIPSKY (V.O.)
...cutting through our sleepy
aquarium, our standard T.V., stores,
political campaigns. Writers who can
do this, like Salinger and Fitzgerald,
forge an unbreakable bond with
readers...
He digs out a quaintly clunky SONY tape recorder that was
state-of-the-art back in 1996. It doesn’t play. He removes
its batteries and looks in drawers for new ones. No luck.

DAY
Lipsky takes the batteries out of his electric toothbrush and
puts them in the recorder.
LIPSKY (V.O.)
You didn’t slip into the books looking
for story, information, but for a
particular experience. The sensation,
for a certain number of pages, of
being David Foster Wallace.”
With a mixture of excitement and trepidation, he inserts
cassette #1 in the machine and presses play. The sound of
David’s voice mid-tape, is both comforting and moving.
DAVID’S VOICE
(on the recording) -- there was, if
anything, a conscious attempt to not
give overt direction. Although, of
course, you end up becoming yourself.
LIPSKY’S VOICE
(on the recording) Did they want you
to be a writer?

INT. CAR/OUTSKIRTS - CHICAGO - 1996 - DAY
A blurry, indistinct POV shot of DAVID FOSTER WALLACE in the
passenger seat of a moving car: Lipsky’s memory struggling to
come into focus.
DAVID’S VOICE
No, the big thing when I was little, I
was like a really serious jock...

Lipsky listens.
DAVID’S VOICE
...city-wide football as a kid. I was
real big, really strong as a kid. And
then for four or five years, I was
gonna be a pro tennis player. My great
dream. Reading was just kind of fun. A
weird thing that I did on the side -

Lipsky stops and presses rewind on the tape player. He
ruminates as we HEAR the whir of the tape rewinding.
FLASHBACK TO:

EXT. DOWNTOWN SKYLINE - NYC - 1996 - NIGHT

The heart-stopping view of the illuminated twin towers tells
us we are in pre-2001 New York.
SUPER TITLE: 12 YEARS EARLIER
LIPSKY (O.S.)
(reads) “I didn’t understand SoHo...
11

INT. BOOK SHOP - UPPER WEST SIDE - NYC - 1996 - NIGHT

11

Lipsky stands before a paltry turnout - consisting of old
people and a few loyal friends (among them his pretty
girlfriend, SARAH) - reading from his novel, The Art Fair.
Here, Lipsky is 30 years old but looks like a student, his
long, dark, Byronic hair framing his fine features.
LIPSKY (CONT’D)
- the warehouses, the old buildings,
the cobbled streets.
Distracted by disinterested CUSTOMERS who continue to browse,
Lipsky hears a muffled giggle and sees a YOUNG COUPLE in the
audience flirting and clearly not listening.
LIPSKY (CONT’D)
It wasn’t the Upper East Side, and it
was dirty. I felt marooned. Our
mother had taken us off the track of
the nice life we’d been on. She’d
moored us in a creepy cul-de-sac with
her art-world friends.
14

EXT./INT. KGB BAR - NYC - 1996 - NIGHT
Deafening music. A crowded, noisy gathering of mostly young,
cool, black-attired New York writers and artists.
LIPSKY (V.O.) (CONTD)
None of the kids in my school had
parents in the art world. It made me
feel different. Like there was
something I had to cover up.”
Lipsky gets two glasses of wine from a bar. We FOLLOW as he
makes his way through the crowd. He knows a lot of people
with whom he exchanges ad-libbed greetings along the way.
They have to SHOUT to be heard above the din.

5.

David, hi!
Great!

BEARDED GUY
How’d your reading go?
LIPSKY

BEARDED GUY
Sorry I missed it!
LIPSKY
Don’t worry about it!
Drinks held aloft, Lipsky continues into the crowd.

A MODEL:

MODEL
I heard you got the Rolling Stone job!
We’ll see!

LIPSKY
I’m sort of on probation!

Lipsky delivers the drink to Sarah, who stands in a circle of
acquaintances in mid-conversation.
SARAH’S FRIEND
Did you see Kirn’s review in New York
Magazine? The guy’s been fucking
canonized!
LIPSKY
Who’s this?
SARAH
David Foster Wallace.
15

INT. LIPSKY’S W 77TH ST APT/BEDROOM/BATHROOM - NYC - 1996 NIGHT
Lipsky, at the bathroom door, reads aloud Walter Kirn’s
review in New York magazine (2/12/96). Sarah comes out in a
towel and he follows her to the bedroom.
LIPSKY
“Next year’s book awards have been
decided.” Can you believe this? “The
plaques and citations can now be put
into escrow.” Unbelievable. “With
Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace a plutonium-dense, satirical whiz-kid
opus that runs to almost a thousand
pages She kisses him as she goes past.

6.
LIPSKY (CONTD)
- (not including footnotes) - the
competition has been obliterated.
It’s as though Paul Bunyan had joined
the NFL or Wittgenstein had gone on
Jeopardy! The novel is that colossally
disruptive. And that spectacularly
good.” That’s the fucking opening
paragraph!
SARAH
What if it actually is that good? You
know? You may just have to read it.
16

INT. LIPSKY’S W 77TH ST APT/LIVING ROOM - NYC - 1996 - DUSK

16

If his 2008 place is grad-student-y, the 1996 Lipsky
residence is smaller and explosively chaotic, like a
teenager’s domain. We find Sarah on the couch reading the
current bestseller, Primary Colors and Lipsky beside her
reading Infinite Jest. Silence.
Shit.
17

LIPSKY

INT. ROLLING STONE MAGAZINE/CUBICLES/BOB'S OFFICE - NYC 1996 - DAY
Buzzing with the hip, youthful industry of people who know
they’re at the place to be. Lipsky drops by to see his
editor, BOB LEVIN, 40, greying, bearded.
LIPSKY
How many times have we interviewed a
writer in the last ten years? Guess.
BOB
Um... how many?
Zero.

LIPSKY
I checked.

BOB
Maybe that’s because Rolling Stone
doesn’t interview writers.
LIPSKY
There hasn’t been a writer like this
one. Once in a generation, maybe.
Hemingway, Pynchon. Let me have this
story.
BOB
What story?

17

7.
Lipsky tosses Newsweek, opened to a photo of Wallace, onto
Bob’s messy desk.
LIPSKY
He’s finishing up his book tour and I
want to go with him.
BOB
That’s not a story.
LIPSKY
He teaches at some small state
university, somewhere in Illinois.
Send me there. Please, Bob. This is
the sort of stuff I should be doing,
not 500-words on boy bands. Talk to
Jann?
17A

INT. ROLLING STONE MAGAZINE/LIPSKY'S CUBICLE - NYC - 1996 - 17A
LATER
Lipsky works at his computer. Newsweek with the Wallace
photo lands on his desk. Lipsky looks up and sees Bob.
BOB
There had better be a story there...
Bob leaves.
(calls)
His smile fades.

18

LIPSKY
There will be!
Now what?

INT. LIPSKY'S W 77TH ST APT/LIVING ROOM - NYC - 1996 - NIGHT 18
Sarah reads her own copy of Infinite Jest as Lipsky walks
back and forth across frame, gathering stuff to pack for his
trip. Laptop. Notebook. Wallace’s books, full of notations
and post-its. Tape recorder, packs of audio cassettes. He
considers then tosses in The Art Fair and zips up his bag.

I/E. CAB/FDR DRIVE - NYC - 1996 - MORNING
Lipsky, in the backseat, reads Infinite Jest; he’s about
three-quarters of the way through it. He makes a note in the
margin, then glances out the window at the passing skyline.

Lipsky, on the road, drives past a sign for Bloomington.

An American landscape of fast-food places and chain stores.
Lipsky’s Grand Am is parked in a 7-Eleven and Citco station.
He stands at a pay phone. (We never intercut during
telephone conversations.)
DAVID’S VOICE
(over phone) Hello?
LIPSKY
David, hi, it’s David Lipsky.
DAVID’S VOICE
Where are you?
LIPSKY
I think I may have made a wrong turn
somewhere. Let’s see, I’m on County
Highway 29, across from Circus Video?
DAVID’S VOICE
How’d you get this number?
LIPSKY
Your publicist sent it in her e-mail,
just in case.
DAVID’S VOICE
You’d do me a favor by losing it.
27

I/E. CAR/DAVID'S STREET - BLOOMINGTON - 1996 - DAY
Stormy skies. Flat, wintry terrain. As the car pulls up,
Lipsky sees, through the windshield, a modest, one-story
brick house in the distance, and a man emerging from it.
From Lipsky’s long shot POV: DAVID FOSTER WALLACE, hands
shoved in his jeans pockets for warmth, accompanied by his
two barking, rambunctious black labs, JEEVES and DRONE.
Lipsky parks. He takes a deep, bracing breath before getting
out of the car to finally meet the man about whom he has
complicated feelings. He walks toward him.

27

9.
This is the first time we see David up close and in focus:
stubble, long hair, blue bandanna, wire-rims, Frye boots,
6’2” and, at this time in his life, burly.
DAVID
You made it.
Yeah.

Hi.

LIPSKY

David offers his wary, tolerant hand. This being the end of
his tour, his patience is frayed and he’s just about talked
out. But, at the same time, it’s Rolling Stone, he wants to
make a good impression.
Dave.

DAVID
Dave Wallace.

LIPSKY
David Lipsky. Pleasure.
Lipsky is cowed but determined to hold his own. These are
two really smart, competitive guys out to impress each other.
Wallace wants to be favorably profiled and Lipsky wants
Wallace’s approval - and a good story.
LIPSKY
Sorry about the phone call.
95% joke.

DAVID

Lipsky laughs.
DAVID (CONTD)
Sorry in advance about the dogs, gonna
be slobbering all over you.
LIPSKY
Oh, I don’t mind.

I love dogs.

DAVID
Yeah? Well, you haven’t met these
guys... It’s cold, let’s go inside.
(to the dogs) Jeeves, Drone! Get over
here!
Lipsky follows David and the rowdy, barking dogs into the
house.

10.
28

INT. DAVID'S HOUSE/LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN - 1996 - CONTINUOUS
Lipsky drops his bag on the messy, shit-stained shag carpet.
The dogs are indeed all over him. Lipsky scratches their
heads and speaks to them as a dog lover would speak to dogs.
LIPSKY
Yes, I’m very glad to meet you, too.
Who are you?
DAVID
That’s Jeeves. The Jeevesmeister. I
got him ‘cause he was so ugly. No one
else wanted him. Now he’s like a
Cover Girl-dog. Aren’t you, Jeeves?
Yes, you are. And this is Drone. My
provisional dog.
LIPSKY
Why provisional?
DAVID
Just showed up one day while Jeeves
and I were out jogging and the rest is
history.
(A beat.)
I feel like I should offer you tea or
something.
LIPSKY
Yeah. Thanks. That would be great.
David goes to put on water. We STAY on Lipsky, casually
studying the room with the eye of a journalist, taking in the
grad-student-like accoutrements: cramped cinder-block
bookshelves; hodgepodge of furniture, an ALANIS MORISSETTE
POSTER conspicuously on the wall. Lipsky, glancing out the
window at the wintry landscape, raises his voice to converse
with David, who’s in the kitchen.
Nice view.

LIPSKY

DAVID (O.S.)
Thank you. I can’t take credit for it.
Lipsky smiles.

Pause.

LIPSKY
So... Have you always been unlisted?
DAVID
(from the kitchen) I had to do that
recently. It was getting crazy.

28

11.
LIPSKY
Because of fans?
DAVID
I don’t know if “fan” would be the
right word... I think what happened
was, I had forgotten to tell my
parents not to give my number out. So
it was people who tracked my parents
down, and um (knowing)

LIPSKY
Ohhh.

DAVID
I have this terrible problem, I just
really hate to hurt people’s feelings.
So I did something kinda cowardly.
LIPSKY
Unlisting your number’s not cowardly.
DAVID
It kinda is. I mean, I changed my
number so these folks couldn’t find me
anymore. There was this computer
operator in Vancouver, lived in a
basement. Who I found really moving.
In terrible terrible pain.
LIPSKY
What did he want from you?
DAVID
Wasn’t clear, and when I would sort of
ask him, he’d get angry, and that’s
when it got scary.
Lipsky sees a child’s drawing displayed on the fridge:
“Chickenhead Dave Wallace.”
LIPSKY
(re: the drawing)

Who’s the artist?

DAVID
Hm? (Lipsky points.) Oh, my friend’s
daughter. Calls me Chickenhead, and I
call her Chickenhead. Her latest
salvo in the war.
Laughing, Lipsky takes out his tape recorder and starts to
set it up but stops. (Lipsky is a nervous laugher; he laughs
a lot, not only where indicated.)

12.
LIPSKY
You mind if I...?
Hey.

DAVID
Do what you’ve got to do.

David watches uncomfortably. The ever-present tape recorder
becomes a third character in this conversation.
DAVID
Listen: Before we start putting stuff
on tape, I gotta ask you something.
Okay...

LIPSKY

DAVID
I need to know that anything that I
ask you five minutes later to not put
in, you won’t put in.
LIPSKY
Absolutely.
He clicks off the recorder.
DAVID
Given my level of fatigue and fuck-up
quotient lately, it’s the only way I
can see doin’ it and not going crazy.
LIPSKY
I understand completely.
Lipsky presses play.
DAVID
Right back on, huh.
LIPSKY
You agreed to the interview.
29

I/E. CAR/MAIN STREET - BLOOMINGTON - 1996 - DAY
Lipsky at the wheel.

David chewing tobacco.

Ad-libs.

DAVID
...There’ll be signs for the school on
the right.
LIPSKY
You like teaching there?

29

13.
DAVID
Yeah, I do, very much, that’s what’s
so fucked, I feel so bad for these
kids.
LIPSKY
Why do you feel bad them, they have
the best writing teacher in the world.
DAVID
If I were there, maybe. The whole
fuss has taken me out of school for
the past two weeks and I’m gonna have
to leave again tomorrow. We’ve got to
get up at the crack of dawn to leave
for the airport, by the way.
LIPSKY
Oh, shit, do we really?
DAVID
That’s what you signed on for, man.
You’re welcome to stick around, write
an article about my dogs. Might be
more interesting, I promise you.
David spits chewed tobacco into a Savarin can.

INT. ISU CAMPUS/CORRIDOR - BLOOMINGTON - 1996 - DAY
David and Lipsky walk to his classroom.
DAVID
Do yourself a favor, don’t expect any
fireworks in there...
Oh.

31A

Okay.

LIPSKY

INT. ISU CAMPUS/CLASSROOM - BLOOMINGTON - 1996 - LATER
The class in-progress. Lipsky observes as David paces.
“on” and his students are eating it up.
DAVID
A campus romance story, I gotta tell
ya, to the average citizen, is not all
that interesting. The great dread of
creative writing professors? “Their
eyes met... over the keg...”
Laughter.

31A
He’s

14.
EARNEST STUDENT
I just want my narrator to be funny
and smart, y’know?
DAVID
I know. You want your narrator to be
funny and smart. Here’s a tip, then:
Have him say funny, smart things some
of the time.
Laughter.

Lipsky jots down a note.
DAVID
You did a good job.
Melissa.

Who’s next?

INT. ISU CAMPUS/LIBRARY CORRIDOR - BLOOMINGTON - 1996 - DUSK 32
Lipsky and David walk down the hall after class.
DAVID
I’m usually a much better teacher than
this. I swear to God.
LIPSKY
I thought you were great.
obviously love you.
Yeah?

LIPSKY
Oh, come on, you know they do.
DAVID
You hungry?

EXT. RESTAURANT - BLOOMINGTON - 1996 - NIGHT

Lipsky and David park and go inside.
33B

INT. RESTAURANT/TABLE - BLOOMINGTON - 1996 - LATER
They give their order to the WAITER.
WAITER
...And what can I get you to drink?
Beer, or...
DAVID
Uh, not for me, thanks.
Rite.

A large Diet

33B

15.
LIPSKY
I’ll have the same.
WAITER
I’ll be right back with your pop.
The waiter goes.

Lipsky sets up the tape recorder.

LIPSKY
You don’t drink.
David doesn’t answer right away.
DAVID
Is that a question?
LIPSKY
It’s an observation.
DAVID
Ah. I see. No; I do not drink. You
can order whatever you want, go right
ahead.
LIPSKY
That’s all right. My friends who have
been through the program say they
didn't want people to drink in front
of them, so out of respect...
DAVID
I'm not any sort of authority on any
sort of “program.” But from my very
limited outside understanding, people
who have been in it for a while: you
could snort cocaine off the back of
your hand and they’re okay.
Lipsky is embarrassed for having been presumptuous.
DAVID
You know what I would love to do?
What?

LIPSKY

DAVID
I would love to do a profile of one of
you guys who’s doin’ a profile of me.
LIPSKY
That is interesting...

Pause.

16.
DAVID
Too po-mo and cute?
LIPSKY
Maybe, for Rolling Stone.
DAVID
But it would be interesting.
(A beat.)
I’m sorry.
LIPSKY
What’s wrong?
DAVID
It’s just, you’re gonna go back to New
York and sit at your desk and shape
this thing however you want. And that
to me is extremely disturbing.
LIPSKY
Why is it disturbing?
DAVID
‘Cause I would like to shape the
impression of me that’s coming across.
I can’t even tell if I like you yet
‘cause I’m too worried whether you
like me.
Before Lipsky can assure him, the waiter brings their sodas.
WAITER
(handing off the sodas)
Here you go. Your food will be out
soon. Can I get you anything else?
LIPSKY
We’re fine, thanks.
The waiter goes.
DAVID
So what’s this piece about?
“Jann” want?

What does

LIPSKY
What’s it like being the most-talked
about writer in the country. That
sort of thing. That sounds so -Lipsky seems embarrassed as soon as he says the words.

17.
DAVID
How do you learn to do this stuff?
What.

LIPSKY

DAVID
Interviewing. Did you go to
interviewing school?
LIPSKY
No... I, uh...
A beat. Lipsky feels a tad fraudulent to identify himself as
a writer to the man whose success and talent he envies.
LIPSKY
I’m a writer.
Oh, yeah?

DAVID

LIPSKY
I mean I write fiction. Just published
my first novel, as a matter of fact.
DAVID
What’s it called?
LIPSKY
The Art Fair?
David shrugs. He’s never heard of it.
for having brought it up.

Lipsky feels foolish

LIPSKY
And I, uh, had a collection published,
a couple of years ago.
Lipsky’s pumping leg betrays his anxiety.

David notices.

DAVID
You’re a nervous guy, aren’t you?
LIPSKY
No no I’m okay. How are you?
DAVID
‘Cause I’m terrified.
LIPSKY
Are you? I think it’s going to be a
lot of fun.

18.
33D

INT. RESTAURANT/TABLE - BLOOMINGTON - 1996 - LATER
The food is decimated.

David is loosening up.

DAVID
The thing about this tour is... I
would like to get laid out of it a
couple of times, but... Like, people
come up, they kinda slither up during
readings or whatever. But it seems
like, what I want is not to have to
take any action.
Like...?

LIPSKY

DAVID
Like, I don’t want to have to say,
“Would you like to come back to my
hotel?” I want them to say, “I am
coming back to the hotel. Where is
your hotel?”
Lipsky laughs.
DAVID
I can’t stand to look like I’m
actively trading on this sexually.
Which of course I would be happy to
do. In retrospect, it was lucky that
I didn’t.
LIPSKY

Why?

DAVID
Basically, it just would have made me
feel lonely.
LIPSKY
Why lonely?
DAVID
Because it wouldn’t have had anything
to do with me, it would have just
been...
Your fame?
Yeah.

LIPSKY

DAVID
Whatever.

33D

19.
LIPSKY
You’re famous. You can say that.
Except... if they’re responding to
your work, and the work is so
personal... then trading on it is
actually another way of meeting you,
isn’t that right?
A beat.

David is impressed by Lipsky’s analysis.
DAVID
That is so good.
Thank you.

LIPSKY

DAVID
This piece’ll really be good if it’s
mostly you. Talk all you want, man,
save me a whole lotta trouble.
Lipsky laughs, sensing his stock has risen, relaxing more
into the rhythm of their conversation.

I/E. CAR/COMMERCIAL DRAG - BLOOMINGTON - 1996 - NIGHT
David at the wheel, driving Lipsky’s rental. Lights from
fast-food restaurant signs light up their faces. Tape
running.
DAVID
So this is what a real car feels like.
The one I have is like riding a power
lawn mower.
LIPSKY
You think being handsome has anything
to do with your success?
DAVID
(incredulously) What?
LIPSKY
You are photogenic... You look good in
your author’s photo.
DAVID
You’d have to come put me down if I
even start thinking that way.
LIPSKY
Thinking what way?
are sold?

About how books

34

20.
DAVID
Like, “Do you want to do a Rolling
Stone interview, do you want to do X,
do you want to do Y” worries me that
what I’m doing right now is being a
whore.
A whore?

LIPSKY
Why?

DAVID
You know, cashing in somehow, or
getting some little celebrity for
myself. That will, from some bizarre
set of misunderstandings, sell more
copies of the book.
Right.

LIPSKY

DAVID
You can quote that. Preferably in a
context where I don’t sound like a
total dweeb.
(A beat.)
By the way, are they gonna send Annie
Leibovitz to take pictures?
LIPSKY
I’m not sure. Possibly.
DAVID
I know: You’re a good-looking guy. We
should have ‘em photograph you, and
say you’re me. Maybe I’ll finally end
up getting laid.
Lipsky laughs.
35

INT. 7-ELEVEN - BLOOMINGTON - 1996 - NIGHT
Muzak. In the blue-white fluorescent light, David and Lipsky
ad-lib while stocking up on six-packs of Diet Rite, chewing
tobacco, Oreos, etc.
At the cash register, Lipsky prepares to pay.
Let me.

LIPSKY

DAVID
You don’t have to pay for my shit.

35

21.
LIPSKY
It’s not coming out of my pocket...
I’ve got an expense account.
DAVID
All right, if you insist...

INT. CAR/COMMERCIAL DRAG - BLOOMINGTON - 1996 - NIGHT

Riding through town, the Davids are eating candy like
teenagers on a joyride.
DAVID
If you ate this stuff all the time,
what would be wrong with that?
LIPSKY
Except for your teeth falling out and
getting really fat?
DAVID
Yeah, it doesn’t have any of the
nourishment of real food, but it’s
real pleasurable masticating and
swallowing this stuff.
LIPSKY
Like seductive commercial
entertainment.
DAVID
Exactly, and what saves us is that
most commercial entertainment isn’t
very good.
LIPSKY
What about good seductive commercial
entertainment - like Die Hard?
DAVID
The first Die Hard?

Great film.

LIPSKY
Brilliant, right?
The best.

EXT. DAVID’S HOUSE - 1996 - NIGHT
The car pulls up, parks. They get out with the spoils from
the 7-Eleven. Mid-discourse:

22.
DAVID
So if the book’s about anything, it’s
about the question of: Why am I
watching all this shit? It’s not
about the shit, it’s about me. Why am
I doing it? And what’s so American
about what I’m doing?
We hear the dogs barking as David unlocks the door and they
enter the house.

INT. DAVID’S HOUSE/LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN - 1996 - CONTINUOUS
The dogs run out to do their thing.
and snacks.

David puts away the soda

DAVID
The minute I start talking about this
stuff, it sounds, number one: very
vague. And, two: really reductive.
LIPSKY
I don’t think you’re being reductive
or vague at all.
DAVID
Because it’s like, I don’t have a
diagnosis, a system of prescriptions.
You know? Like, why are we - and by
“we” I mean people like you and me:
mostly white, upper middle class,
obscenely well-educated, doing really
interesting jobs, sitting in really
expensive chairs, watching the best,
most sophisticated electronic
equipment money can buy - why do we
feel empty and unhappy?
LIPSKY
Kinda like Hamlet.

With channel-

DAVID
I’m not saying TV is bad or a waste of
your time. Any more than, you know,
masturbation is bad or a waste of your
time. It's a pleasurable way to spend
a few minutes. But if you're doing it
twenty times a day, if your primary
sexual relationship is with your own
hand, then there's something wrong.

38

23.
LIPSKY
At least with masturbation, some
action has been performed, though,
right?
DAVID
All right, you could make me look like
a real dick if you print this: Yes,
you're performing muscular movements
with your hand as you're jerking off.
But what you're doing is running a
movie in your head, and having a
fantasy relationship with somebody who
isn't real, in order to stimulate a
purely neurological response.
Look: as the Internet grows in the
next ten, fifteen years, and virtual
reality pornography becomes a reality,
we're gonna have to develop some
machinery, inside our guts, to help us
turn off pure, unalloyed pleasure.
Otherwise, I don’t know about you, but
I’m gonna have to leave the planet.
LIPSKY
(smiles uncertainly)

Why?

DAVID
Because the technology is just gonna
get better and better. And it's gonna
get easier and easier, and more and
more convenient, and more and more
pleasurable, to be alone with images
on a screen, given to us by people who
do not love us but want our money.
Which is fine. In low doses. But if
that's the basic main staple of your
diet? You're gonna die. In a
meaningful way, you're going to die.
Silence. Lipsky mulls over the gravity of what David has
said. David breaks the portentous silence when he pops a wad
of tobacco in his mouth.
LIPSKY
Can I try that?
DAVID
Be my guest. It takes some getting
used to.
Lipsky tries it and makes a horrible face.

David laughs.

LIPSKY
You mind if I use your uh...
Amused, David points the way to the bathroom.

I believe it’s unoccupied.
Lipsky goes, leaving the tape running.

Lipsky spits the tobacco into the sink. He cups his hands
under the running water and rinses his mouth. He looks at
himself in the mirror and takes a deep, fortifying breath.
He stealthily opens the medicine cabinet and finds it stocked
with jars of vitamins, Stri-Dex pads and tubes of Topol,
toothpaste for smokers. He jots down notes.

David is playing with his

LIPSKY
Do you not have a TV?
DAVID
I do not have a TV.
How come?

LIPSKY

DAVID
‘Cause if I had a TV, I’d watch it all
the time. I don’t even know if I would
watch it; it would be on all the time my version of a fireplace. A source
of warmth and light in the corner that
I would occasionally get sucked into.
LIPSKY
Did you watch a lot of T.V. when you
were a kid?
Yeah.

DAVID
A lot. You?

25.
LIPSKY
Me? Yeah, I did. I moved in with a
woman who grew up without a
television, and living with her, the
first month was torture, and then I
realized it was probably the best
thing for me.
DAVID
Did you guys stay together?
LIPSKY
It’s complicated.
Why?

DAVID

LIPSKY
I was seeing this woman, then she
moved to L.A. and we theoretically
broke up. And I started seeing this
other woman, but then I started seeing
the first woman again - trying the bicoastal thing - and the second...
Well, let’s just say she hasn’t taken
it very well.
DAVID
It’s so much easier having dogs. You
don’t get laid; but you also don’t get
the feeling you’re hurting their
feelings all the time. I emphasize:
strictly platonic relationship with
the dogs.
LIPSKY
You’re not dating anyone?
DAVID
Seriously dating? No. I’m out of
practice; I wouldn’t know what to say.
LIPSKY
You want to have kids?
DAVID
Yeah, I think someday I do; do you?
Yeah.

LIPSKY
Eventually.

I think.

26.
DAVID
Writing books is kinda like raising
children, but you gotta be careful:
you should take pride in the work but
it’s bad to want that glory to reflect
back on you.
LIPSKY
You worry about having children?
David seems far away; this is difficult for him. After a
beat, he speaks, sounding vulnerable, which doesn’t go
unnoticed by Lipsky.
DAVID
I don’t know that I want to say
anything more about it - okay?
LIPSKY
(prepared to back off)

That’s fine.

DAVID
I mean, we can joke about getting laid
on tour and stuff, but...
LIPSKY
I just thought, it’d be nice to have
someone to be sharing all this
wonderful stuff with.
DAVID
Yeah. I really have wished I was
married, the last couple of weeks.
You have?

LIPSKY

DAVID
Yeah, because nobody quite gets it.
Your friends who aren’t in the writing
biz are all just awed by your picture
in Time, and your agent and editor are
good people, but they have their own
agendas. It’s fun talking to you
about it, but you've got an agenda,
too, and a set of interests that
diverges from mine.
LIPSKY
That’s true...

27.
DAVID
There’s something nice about having
somebody who kinda shared your life,
and that you could allow yourself just
to be happy and confused with.
LIPSKY
Somebody you can call when you get
back to the hotel.
DAVID
Uh huh. (A beat.)
married at thirty?

So, why aren’t you

LIPSKY
Why aren't you married at thirty-four?
You first.

DAVID

LIPSKY
Okay. Um... I think it's hard to cast
that role … to fill it when you know
it's for thirty or forty years …
someone who, whatever mental landscape
you're in, they're going to be in it
too, you need someone who'll fit any
landscape you can imagine.
DAVID
Well, I can't put it as well as you
did about the “mental landscapes,” I
just know I'm hard to be around.
David’s “mental landscapes” reference: competitive, fawning,
mocking? Lipsky isn’t sure.
Why?

LIPSKY

DAVID
Because when I want to be by myself,
like to work, I really want to be by
myself. I think if you dedicate
yourself to anything, one facet of
that is that it makes you very very
self-conscious. You end up using
people. Wanting them around when you
want them around, but then sending
them away.
LIPSKY
Comes with the territory, though,
doesn’t it? Self-consciousness?

28.
DAVID
There’s good self-consciousness. And
then there’s this toxic, paralyzing,
raped-by-psychic-Bedouins selfconsciousness.
Lipsky laughs.
LIPSKY
(re: Alanis poster)
Can you do me a favor? Can you tell
me about that poster over there?
DAVID
Alanis? I don’t know, I guess I'm
susceptible like everybody else. Why?
LIPSKY
She’s pretty, alright...
DAVID
Yeah, but in a very sloppy, very human
way. That squeaky, orgasmic quality
in her voice? Here’s what it is: A
lot of women in magazines are pretty
in a way that isn’t erotic because
they don’t look like anybody you know.
True.

LIPSKY

DAVID
You can’t imagine them putting a
quarter in a parking meter or eating a
bologna sandwich. But her, I don’t
know, I just find her absolutely
riveting.
LIPSKY
How’d you get to know her, her music,
I mean?
DAVID
Listening to cheesy Bloomington radio,
and “I Want to Tell You” came on.
LIPSKY
(correcting him) “You Oughta Know.”
What?

DAVID

29.
LIPSKY
“I Want to Tell You” is the book O.J.
Simpson wrote.
Oh, right.

DAVID

LIPSKY
Wouldn’t it be great if O.J. Simpson
sang “You Oughta Know” and Alanis
Morissette wrote a book about not
killing two people?
They laugh.

Lipsky is pleased to make David laugh.

DAVID
If somehow this whole fuss could get
me even like a five-minute cup of tea
with her...
LIPSKY
Why don’t you put out feelers, see if
she’d be willing to meet you?
DAVID
You serious? I would never do that.
Why not?

LIPSKY

DAVID
I’d be too terrified.
do that?

Why, you would

LIPSKY
If I were you? Why not?
DAVID
A date with Alanis Morissette? What
would I say to her? “Hello, Miss
Morissette. What is it like to be
you?” (gruff voice) “I don’t know shut up. And get the fuck away from
me.”
LIPSKY
But you’d go if she called? “Hey,
Dave. I’m at the Drake in Chicago.
Let’s have that tea.”
DAVID
Yeah... except this is gonna look
ridiculous: like I’m using Rolling
Stone as a vehicle to, like -

It’s been used for worse.

Yes, I would do it.

Perspiring heavily, all the way up

Goin’ nuts. It would cost me like a
week of absolute trauma. But yeah, I
would do it in a heartbeat.
David realizes the late hour.
DAVID (CONT’D)
Look, I like... I like talking to you
but we have to get up real early.
LIPSKY
What is it, like ten o’clock?
DAVID
It’s eleven-thirty, dickbrain.
LIPSKY
Shit...I am so sorry, I completely
lost track of time. When should I
pick you up in the morning?
Lipsky gets his coat.

Where you going?

Let me get this shit out of the way...
Hm. (re: the rumpled sheet) Might be
a good idea to change that.
Together, they put on a clean sheet.

When they’re done:

Uh, leave the door open for the dogs.
Oh, okay.

They like to wander from room to room

Windshield wipers clear falling sleet. The tape recorder on
the transmission between them. Radio plays softly. Riding
past farmland, plants, strip malls. David, in the passenger
seat, gives the lay of the land.
DAVID
...There’s a Mitsubishi plant, and
then there’s a lot of farm-support
stuff, like Ro-Tech, Anderson Seeds...
LIPSKY
What are you doing here?
aren’t you in New York?

I mean, why

DAVID
Every time I go to New York, I get
caught up in this - there’s this
enormous hiss of egos at various
stages of inflation and deflation.
It’s me-me-me.
Lipsky takes out his tape recorder.
LIPSKY
So, I gotta ask: What’s with the
bandanna?
What?

DAVID
What do you mean?

LIPSKY
People think it’s a way you’re trying
to connect with the younger reading
audience.

Is that what people think? I don’t
know many Gen-Xers who wear ‘em.
Jeez. I don’t know what to say. I
guess I wish you hadn’t brought this
up.
Why?

LIPSKY

DAVID
Because now I’m worrying that it’s
going to seem intentional. Like if I
don’t wear it, am I not wearing it
because I’m bowing to other people’s
perception that it’s a commercial
choice? Or do I do what I want, even
though it’s perceived as commercial and it’s just like one more crazy
circle to go around.
Sorry.

LIPSKY
When did you start wearing

DAVID
In Tuscon. It was a hundred degrees
all the time. I would perspire so
much... I would drip into the electric
typewriter, I was nervous I was gonna
give myself a shock. And then I
discovered that I felt better with
them on.
Uh huh.

LIPSKY

DAVID
I know it’s a security blanket for me whenever I’m nervous. Or feel like I
have to keep myself together. It
makes me feel kinda creepy that people
view it as an affectation or a
trademark or something. It’s more of
a foible, the recognition of a
weakness, that I’m kinda afraid my
head’s gonna explode.
Lipsky laughs.

LIPSKY
Your parents are both academics?
DAVID
My dad, philosophy; my mom, English.
You?
LIPSKY
Me? My dad’s in advertising, my mom’s
a painter. When they split up, I
lived with my mother in SoHo and my
brother moved in with my dad.
DAVID
Sounds like there’s a story there.
LIPSKY
There is; I just wrote it.
DAVID
So what was that like, your family
divided that way?
LIPSKY
Hey, who’s interviewing whom? How old
were you when you started writing
fiction?
DAVID
Twenty-one?
LIPSKY
Never before?
DAVID
I think I started a World War Two
novel when I was nine.
LIPSKY
What about?
DAVID
A bunch of people with strangely
hyperdeveloped skills and powers, who
are going to invade Hitler's bunker.
Then, in college, I wrote a couple of
papers for other people.

51

35.
LIPSKY
They were paying you to write their
papers?
DAVID
Well, I wouldn't put it that coarsely.
But let's say there were complicated
systems of reward. I’d read two or
three of their papers to learn, you
know, what their music sounded like.
And I remember thinking, “Man, I'm
really good at this. I'm a weird kind
of forger. I mean, I can sound kind of
like anybody.”
LIPSKY
Odds are I’m gonna want to talk to
your parents.
What for?

Crap jobs? Let’s see: I was a security
guard for this software company for
three and a half months.
Really.

LIPSKY

DAVID
I had to wear this polyester uniform,
and walk under these fluorescent
lights, twirlin’ my baton, checking in
every ten minutes: [mimes a walkietalkie] “All clear at this cubicle!”
Like, every bad '60s novel about
meaningless authority.
LIPSKY
And were you thinking, “My God, I had
two books come out when I was in my
early twenties and here I am...”?
DAVID
No. As a matter of fact, one reason I
liked that job is, I walked around not
thinking. In a really like, “Huh:
there's a ceiling tile.”
LIPSKY
And after the security guard thing?
DAVID
This is the worst: I worked as a towel
boy at this chichi health club.
LIPSKY
A “towel boy?”
DAVID
They called me something other than a
towel boy, but I was in effect a towel
boy. Who every once in a while was
entrusted with the job of checking
people in, having them show their i.d?
Uh huh.

LIPSKY

DAVID
Anyway, I'm sitting there, and who
should walk in to get their towel, but
this guy, this writer I knew.

Who received a Whiting Writer's Award
the same year I had, like two years
earlier.
LIPSKY
Oh, shit...
DAVID
So I see this guy that I'd been up on
this fucking rostrum with, having
Eudora Welty give us this prize Oh, God!

LIPSKY

DAVID
- And two years later, I'm like … It's
the only time I've literally dived
under something, to have somebody
avoid seeing me.
LIPSKY
Did you think you were done then?
DAVID
Yeah. I was pretty sure life was over.
LIPSKY
This is after your suicide watch?
David blinks.

A beat.

DAVID
How’d you know about that?
LIPSKY
I read it somewhere. McLean’s, right?
How long were you there?
DAVID
Eight days, I think.
LIPSKY
Why were you there?
DAVID
Mostly 'cause I was scared I would do
something stupid. I had a friend from
high school who tried to kill himself
by sitting in a garage with the car
runnin'. And what it turned out was,
he didn't die, but it really fucked up
his brain.

38.
And I knew, that if anybody was fated
to fuck up a suicide attempt, it was
me.
LIPSKY
So there you are still in your
twenties...
DAVID
My late twenties.
LIPSKY
Your late twenties, somewhat in pain
about your desire to become a sort of
successful literary person.
DAVID
I think probably the not very
sophisticated diagnosis is that I was
depressed. 'Cause by this time, my
ego's all invested in the writing.
It's the only thing that I've gotten,
you know, food pellets from the
universe for. So I felt really
trapped: Like, “Uh-oh, my five years
is up. I've gotta move on, but I don't
want to move on.” I was really stuck.
And drinking was part of that. But it
wasn't that I was stuck because I
drank. It was like, I really sort of
felt like my life was over at twentyeight. And that felt really bad, and I
didn't wanna feel it. So I would do
all kinds of things: I mean, I would
drink real heavy, I would like fuck
strangers. Oh, God -- Or, then, for
two weeks I wouldn't drink, and I'd
run ten miles every morning, in a
desperate, like very American, “I will
fix this somehow, by taking radical
action” sort of thing.
LIPSKY
And here you are, promoting this
acclaimed book. Not bad.

Pages and I wrote him a fan letter,
that’s right.
DAVID
Julie has worked with a whole lot of
writers JULIE
So I’m discriminating.
DAVID
Exactly. And we discovered that we
actually kind of like each other as
people.
Indeed.

JULIE

DAVID
That’s how I met Jon Franzen: I wrote
him a fan letter. Writers are
pushovers when it comes to flattery.
You could try it sometime.

MARTHA CAVENAUGH, the shop manager, a robust earth-mother who
loves books and her job, offers cookies to Julie, Betsy,
Lipsky and Patty while David looks over his reading
selection.
MARTHA
You sure I can’t get you something to
drink?
DAVID
Do you have any artificial spit?
Everyone laughs, perhaps a little too heartily.
DAVID
No, it’s an actual pharmaceutical
product. Zero-Lube.
LIPSKY
Artificial saliva?

Really?

DAVID
Yeah, but it’s way better ‘cause it
lubricates. You don’t get that clicky
sound you do with dry mouth.
He demonstrates.
MARTHA
I’ll have to remember that.
DAVID
Next tour, I bring a case.
MARTHA
In the meantime, what can I get you?
Water?

DAVID
No ice?

Martha goes to fetch it.
Lipsky and Betsy.
LIPSKY
Are you a fiction writer, too?
BETSY
I’m a poet, actually.
Oh, wow.

LIPSKY

BETSY
Just got my first poem published in
the Kenyon Review.
Really!

LIPSKY
Wow! Congratulations!

David observes Lipsky chatting animatedly with Betsy,
disapproval registering on his face.

Martha leads them to the side of the podium.

On the move:

DAVID
I don’t mean to be a prima donna, but
I’d really prefer it if we didn’t have
a Q & A.
MARTHA
Of course. Whatever you feel most
comfortable with.
DAVID
It’s always stuff like “Where do you
get your ideas?” (to Lipsky) From a
Time-Life subscription series for
$17.95 a month.
Lipsky and Martha laugh.
MARTHA
It’s show time!
Martha goes to the podium.
DAVID

DAVID
There you go.
The young woman looks at it with bemusement.
YOUNG WOMAN
What is that supposed to be, a
computer?
What?

No.

DAVID
It’s a smiley face. See?
YOUNG WOMAN

Ohhh...

DAVID
If you want, I could put Wite-Out over
it...
YOUNG WOMAN
That’s okay.
You sure?

DAVID
It’s your book...

Lipsky, in ad-libbed conversation with Betsy and Julie,
observes from the sidelines.
Back to David. A NERDY GUY pulls out the Vintage paperback
copy of The Broom of the System.
Oh no.

DAVID
That old thing?

NERDY GUY
Do you mind...?
DAVID
Eh, the new one’s better.
The guy plunks down a copy of Infinite Jest, too.
DAVID
Now we’re talkin’.
The guy laughs as David sees Lipsky laughing with Julie and
Betsy and is threatened by it. Lipsky sees David looking at
them and smiles; David ominously doesn’t return the smile.
He turns instead to the next customer.
DAVID
Who’s next?

INT. I-HOP - ST PAUL - 1996 - NIGHT
David and Lipsky are dining out on pancakes with Julie and
Betsy. Laid-back, improvisational. It’s toward the end of
the meal.
DAVID
I couldn’t be plain old “Dave Wallace”
‘cause there were “Dave Wallaces” all
over the place. And “David Raines
Wallace” wrote for The New Yorker.
That’s when Fred Hill asked me what my
middle name was and decided that was
what my name was gonna be.
LIPSKY
This is literally the worst superhero
origin story.
DAVID
I didn’t claim it was an origin
story...
BETSY
Dave, remember in Tucson, that
professor you kind of locked horns
with?
DAVID
My nemesis who shall remain nameless?
I think I was kind of a prick. But so
was he. I was just unteachable. I
mean, I don't think I was actively
unpleasant in class.
BETSY
You were pretty unpleasant. Well, I
loved it. (to Lipsky) He was
pleasantly unpleasant.
DAVID
Well, I’ve got to get up
unconscionably early for this public
radio interview, so we’d better...
LIPSKY
Which means that I have to get up
early, too.
DAVID
You can do whatever the fuck you want.
Sleep in if you want to.
David’s mercurial attitude toward him unnerves Lipsky.

Julie at the wheel; Betsy in the passenger seat. David and
Lipsky are in the backseat smoking, each blowing smoke out of
their respective windows. Spirits high, they sing along with
the Alanis Morissette song “You Oughta Know” on the radio.
JULIE
Can you close the windows,
pleaaasssse, it’s fucking freezing!
LIPSKY
Oh but this is our hypothermia smoking
tour of the Midwest.
Julie and Betsy laugh.

David does not.

BETSY
“Hypothermia smoking tour.”
that!

I love

LIPSKY
Oh, thank you.
BETSY
Sounds like something Dave would say.
DAVID
(to himself) Doesn’t it.
David doesn’t like that Lipsky amused his friends with a DFWlike joke - and Lipsky senses tension.

JULIE
What are you doing tomorrow after your

DAVID
Don’t know yet.
JULIE
Give us a call, okay?
BETSY
We’re here.
Ad-libbed “Good night”s all around. Julie and Betsy drive

LIPSKY
That was nice.
Yeah.

LIPSKY
How does that feel? People fighting
to get in, big line of people who want
to impress you...
We find David and Lipsky in twin beds, facing each other,
talking like college roommates pulling an all-nighter.
DAVID
I’ll tell you - having an audience
with really really pretty girls who
are paying attention to you, and like
what you’re sayin’? Is gratifying on
a fairly I think simple mammal level.
I know.

LIPSKY
Why is that?

50.
DAVID
I think pretty girls are what we most
sort of dream and despair of ever
having, of ever paying attention to
you. And there they are, in the front
row, making eyes at you.
LIPSKY
I think my girlfriend is in love you.
DAVID
No she’s not.
LIPSKY
I think she is. I think she likes
your writing more than she likes mine.
It’s getting kind of annoying.
DAVID
Get her on the phone.
LIPSKY
No, she’s probably sleeping anyway.
A beat.
Please?

DAVID

INT. HOTEL WHITNEY/DAVID'S ROOM - MINNEAPOLIS - 1996 MOMENTS LATER
Lipsky holds the phone.

We HEAR Sarah’s voice.

SARAH’S VOICE
(over the phone) Hello?
LIPSKY

Hi.
Hi!

SARAH’S VOICE
How’s it going?

It’s fine.

LIPSKY
Did I wake you up?

SARAH’S VOICE
No, I’m up reading Infinite Jest.
It’s pretty amazing.
LIPSKY
Good. Listen: Somebody wants to say
hello. Hold on a sec.

71

51.
He hands the receiver to David.
DAVID
(whispers to Lipsky)
again?
Sarah.

What’s her name

LIPSKY

David speaks into the phone. (When David is on the phone, we
- and Lipsky - hear only his side of the conversation.)
Sarah?

DAVID
Hi. It’s Dave Wallace.

Lipsky tries to reclaim the phone a couple of times during
the following but David, engaged in a power play, retains
control: his way of re-asserting himself after Lipsky’s
perceived transgressions with David’s women friends.
DAVID
Nice to meet you telephonically, too.
Let me ask him. (to Lipsky) Are you
behaving yourself?
LIPSKY
She’s asking that?
DAVID
(to Sarah) I’m reasonably sure he is.
I don’t have eyes on him 24/7.
Lipsky reaches for the phone but David continues talking.
DAVID (CONT’D)
What’re you up to tonight? Oh, wow.
You’re kidding me. Oh my gosh. What
part are you up to? Wow, you’re
really far along! Oh, thank you.
That’s very flattering.
Now that David’s talking about the book, Lipsky gives up in
frustration, plops into a chair, and quietly seethes.
72

INT. HOTEL WHITNEY/LIPSKY'S ROOM - MINNEAPOLIS - 1996 - LATER 72
Lipsky, in bed, is on the phone with Sarah.
LIPSKY
What the fuck was that about?
SARAH’S VOICE
(over phone) What.

He’s livid.

52.
LIPSKY
You were on the phone with him for
like a half hour!
SARAH’S VOICE
It wasn’t a half hour...
LIPSKY
It was! It was twenty-five minutes; I
timed it! You were only supposed to
say hello!

INT. HOTEL WHITNEY/CORRIDOR/DAVID'S ROOM - MINNEAPOLIS - 1996 73

Lipsky leaves his room and goes down the hall to collect
David. He knocks on his door. Listens. TV sounds from
inside. Knocks again.
David?

LIPSKY
Escort’s waiting. We gotta go.

David, still in boxers and Chicago Cubs t-shirt, frazzled,
opens the door.
DAVID
Sorry, man. Got totally lost in an
orgy of crap.
David ducks into the bathroom.
DAVID
A simultaneous broadcast of Falcon
Crest, Magnum P.I., and Charlie’s
Angels: A perfect storm of shit. Out

We hear the shower running. Lipsky sits on the bed watching
Jaclyn Smith and Farrah Fawcett.

EXT. HOTEL WHITNEY/LOBBY - MINNEAPOLIS - 1996 - MORNING

Lipsky and David, with his shower-wet hair pinned up, find
Patty’s car out front. They get in the backseat.

Yes.

Her disapproval showing, she pulls away.

I know who you are.
David introduces Lipsky.
DAVID
My amanuensis, Mr. Boswell.
The P.A. shakes Lipsky’s hand, playing along with the joke.
P.A.
(in greeting)
“Mr. Boswell.” Right this way.
She leads David, followed by Lipsky, down a corridor past
glass-walled studios. Lipsky sees people recognize David,
whisper among themselves. Young women smile shyly, excited
to be in the presence of a cool celebrity.
P.A.
We record digitally. I hope that’s OK.

So only yes or no answers?
She rolls her eyes.

INT. MINNESOTA PUBLIC RADIO/NPR STUDIO - 1996 - DAY
The interview goes on the air. Lipsky observes from outside
the booth. The NPR GUY has a good radio voice.
NPR GUY
My guest today is David Foster
Wallace, who has burst on the literary
scene with his 1,079-page, three-poundthree-ounce novel, Infinite Jest.

Jay McInerney called it “something
like a sleek Vonnegut chassis wrapped
in layers of post-millennial Zola.”
David Foster Wallace, welcome to our
show.
DAVID
Thank you, glad to be here.
He exchanges looks with Lipsky outside the booth.
NPR GUY
You have said that you saw yourself as
- quote - “a combination of being
incredibly shy, and being an
egomaniac, too.”
DAVID
I think I said “exhibitionist, also.”
Meaning?

NPR GUY

David glances at Lipsky.
DAVID
Well, I think being shy basically
means being self-absorbed to the
extent that it makes it difficult to
be around other people.
NPR GUY
Difficult for you, or difficult for
the other people?
DAVID
I suppose a little bit of both.
77

I/E. PATTY'S CAR/MINNESOTA PUBLIC RADIO - ST PAUL - 1996 DAY
Patty waits outside her car as the Davids join her.
PATTY
That was wonderful! I listened to the
whole show! So interesting! I may
have to buy your book and read it!
DAVID
Sorry about that.
David and Lipsky climb in.

55.
PATTY
So, you have the rest of the day free.
Where would you like to go?
DAVID
Do you know where the Mall of America
is?
79

E./I. MALL OF AMERICA/VARIOUS SHOPS - MINNESOTA - 1996 - DAY 79
They discover the vast courts at each corner of the mall.
They walk through the amusement park; ride a roller coaster;
ride a carousel. In a mirror maze, they make their way
through, trying not to bump into the walls. They try flight
simulators, play mini-golf, and walk through the underwater
tunnels of the aquarium. They stare blankly at Build-a-Bear
bear parts which stare blankly back at them.

80

INT. MALL OF AMERICA/FOOD COURT - MINNESOTA - 1996 - DAY
David and Lipsky sit over lunch, the recorder running on the
table between them. They watch SHOPPERS.
DAVID
I wanted to write something that had
kind of the texture of what life was
like in America right now: This
enormous tsunami of stuff comin’ at
you. And also - it’s not unfun.
LIPSKY
Not at all. It is sort of heavy,
though. I mean weight-wise.
DAVID
My friend said when it hit the porch,
it sounded like a car bomb going off.
LIPSKY
Who are your readers?

College kids?

DAVID
The people who seem most enthusiastic
are young men. Which I guess I can
understand - it’s a fairly male book,
a fairly nerdy book, about loneliness.
You can expect that somebody who's
willing to read and read hard a
thousand-page book is gonna be
somebody with some loneliness issues.
LIPSKY
You think it’s about loneliness?

80

56.
DAVID
I think if there is sort of a sadness
for people under forty-five or
something, it has to do with pleasure
and achievement and entertainment.
And a kind of emptiness at heart of
what they thought was going on, that
maybe I can hope that parts of the
book will speak to their nerve endings
a little bit.
He presses stop on the tape recorder, surprising Lipsky.
DAVID (CONT’D)
By the way, if you quote any of this,
you’d do me a favor if you’d say that
I’m talking about what I hope for the
book, or what the book is tryin’ to
do, I don’t pretend that it has. Okay?
LIPSKY
That’s fine.
Lipsky presses play.
LIPSKY
So: the Walter Kirn review, in New
York Magazine DAVID
Didn’t read it. I mean, I heard.
LIPSKY
“Next year’s book awards have been
decided” kind of thing? How’d it feel?
DAVID
I applauded his taste and discernment.
What do you want me to say? How would
you feel about it?
LIPSKY
How would I feel? That I’d known all
along it was good, and here was
someone validating that.
DAVID
All I know is, this is absolutely the
best I could do between like 1992 and
1995. And if everybody hated it, I
wouldn’t be thrilled, but I don’t
think I’d be devastated, either.

57.
It’s like, if you’re used to doing
heavy-duty literary stuff that doesn’t
sell well, being human animals with
egos, we find a way to accommodate
that fact by the following equation:
If it sells really well and gets a lot
of attention, it must be shit. Then,
of course, the ultimate irony is: if
your thing gets a lot of attention and
sells really well, then the very
mechanism you’ve used to shore
yourself up when your stuff didn’t
sell well is now part of the Darkness
Nexus when it does, so you’re screwed.
You can’t win.
Lipsky is laughing.

INT. MULTIPLEX/THEATER - MINNESOTA - 1996 - DAY
A loud, explosive action scene from Broken Arrow with John
Travolta and Christian Slater fills the screen.
Seated up close, their heads craned looking up at the screen,
Julie and Betsy sit together and Lipsky monitors David’s
reactions. David is an ideal spectator, totally engaged with
a child-like guilelessness that Lipsky finds endearing.
DAVID
Oh boy... oh wow, oh jeez...!

There’s also beer.

LIPSKY
Soda’s fine, thank you.

Betsy gets something out of her bag and joins Lipsky in the
kitchen.
Hey.

A moment later, David gets up, walks over to Lipsky, and
backs him up against the fridge.

What are you doing?
Lipsky initially thinks David is joking.

LIPSKY
Hitting on...? I was talking to her.

Her e-mail address. In case I had
questions, about the piece I am
writing about you.
DAVID
Well, I don’t want her talking to you.
Fine!

LIPSKY
I won’t contact her.

DAVID
I told you she and I dated when we
were in grad school... The least you
can do is show me the respect of not
coming on to her right in front of me.
LIPSKY
Dave, I’m sorry if it looked that way.
That was not my intention. Besides,
why would I want to get involved with
somebody who lives in St. Paul?
DAVID
You’re already involved with somebody
who lives in Los Angeles...
David is glaring at him when we hear:
JULIE (O.S.)
Are you okay?
DAVID

Everything’s fine. Thank you.

David goes back to the women.

You make a point of holding back there’s something obvious about you
holding back your intelligence, to be
with people who are younger or maybe
not as agile as you are...
DAVID
That would make me a real asshole,
wouldn’t it? I don’t think writers
are any smarter than other people. I
think they may be more compelling in
their stupidity, or in their
confusion.

66.
But I think one of the true ways that
I have gotten smarter is, I’ve
realized that I’m not much smarter
than other people.
LIPSKY
Yeah, right.
DAVID
There are ways in which other people
are a lot smarter than me. Like, I
don’t know, it makes me feel kinda
lonely...
What.

LIPSKY

DAVID
There’s certain stuff I’ve told you
that’s really true and, frankly, I
think it’s been brave of me.
LIPSKY
Absolutely.
DAVID
I’ve written enough of these “pieces”
to know that you could present this in
a hundred different ways. Ninety of
which I’m really gonna come off as a
monumental asshole. But it seems like
your read of this is, “Huh: what an
interesting persona Dave is adopting
for the purposes of this interview.”
LIPSKY
That’s not what I’m saying.
DAVID
If we’d done this interview through
the mail? And I had access to a
library, and could look stuff up?
My dream would be for you to write
this up, send it to me, and I get to
rewrite all my quotes - which of
course you’ll never do. When I’m in a
room by myself, alone, and have enough
time, I can be really really smart.
Don’t get me wrong: I think I’m
bright; I think I’m talented. I don’t
mean to sound disingenuous.
(amused)

LIPSKY
Oh, no?!

67.
DAVID
I am not an idiot. I mean, you know,
I can talk intelligently with you
about stuff. But I can’t quite keep
up with you.
LIPSKY
That is such bullshit.
DAVID
Believe me: I’m not just “Aw-shucks,
I’m just in from the country, I’m not
a real writer, I’m just a regular
guy.” I’m not trying to lay some kind
of shit. And I’m LIPSKY
You just did it again! You flatter
me, but are you just being
patronizing?
DAVID
I just think to look across the room
and automatically assume that somebody
else is less aware than me, or that
somehow their interior life is less
rich, and complicated, and acutely
perceived than mine, makes me not as
good a writer.
Why?

LIPSKY

DAVID
Because that means I'm going to be
performing for a faceless audience,
instead of trying to have a
conversation with a person. If you
think that's faux, then you think what
you want. I've got a serious fear of
being a certain way. And a set I think
of like, real convictions about why
I'm continuing to do this, why it's
worthwhile. Why it's not just an
exercise in basically getting my dick
sucked. And, you know what?, this is a
very clever tactic of yours:
LIPSKY
Tactic, what tactic?
DAVID
Get me a little pissed off, a little
less guarded, I’m gonna reveal more.

68.
Yes, it's true: I treasure my regularguy-ness; I've started to think it's
my biggest asset as a writer, that I'm
pretty much just like everybody else.
(A beat.)
You know what? I’m not doing any kind
of faux thing with you; I'm not gonna
say it again.
LIPSKY
Okay, but the faux thing - what you
just said - is an example of the faux
thing. You don't want to take the
risk of giving the full you.
DAVID
Look, I don’t know if you’re a very
nice man or not. It’s very clear that
you don’t believe a word I’ve said.
LIPSKY
All your protesting... “I’m just a
regular guy.” You don’t crack open a
thousand-page book ‘cause you heard
the author’s a regular guy. You read
it because the author is brilliant.
Because you want him to be brilliant.
So who the fuck are you kidding?
DAVID
I don’t have the brain cells left to
play any kind of “faux” games with
you.
Fine.

LIPSKY

David presses stop on the tape recorder.

EXT. HIGHWAY/GAS STATION - CENTRAL ILLINOIS - 1996 AFTERNOON

In nasty weather, Lipsky fills the tank, leaving the cap on
the roof. David runs around to the other side of the car to
take over driving duty from Lipsky. They drive away.
96

I/E. CAR/OUTSKIRTS - BLOOMINGTON - 1996 - AFTERNOON
Closer to home. Lipsky glances over at David, at the wheel,
who seems faraway and depressed.
LIPSKY
What are you thinking?

96

69.
DAVID
Tour’s over.
LIPSKY
Just hit you?
DAVID
Yeah. I’m gonna have to feel all this
now, instead of just sleepwalk through
it.
LIPSKY
What do you mean by “sleepwalk?”
DAVID
I’ve kind of unplugged myself for the
last three weeks. Meeting a whole lot
of new people, having to do things,
you’re in a constant low-level state
of anxiety. And sort of deep,
existential, you know: fear, that you
feel kind of all the way down to your
butthole.
LIPSKY
What are you afraid of? I mean,
what’s the worst thing that could
possibly happen?
DAVID
The worst? That I’ll really get to
like it. That’s the worst.
LIPSKY
The attention?
Uh huh.

DAVID

LIPSKY
(nods, then)
And what would be so wrong about that?
DAVID
Become one of these hideous: “Yet
another publication party, and Hey,
there’s Dave sticking his head in the
back of the photo.” I’d rather be
dead.
Why?

LIPSKY

70.
DAVID
I don’t want to be seen that way.
Why, would you?
LIPSKY
Well, if you’re deriving your
satisfaction from talking about your
work, as opposed to writing, then,
yeah, I guess you’d get a lot less
done.
DAVID
Exactly. And there’s nothing more
grotesque than somebody who’s going
around, “I’m a writer, I’m a writer,
I’m a writer.”
Is that a dig at Lipsky?

Lipsky thinks so.

DAVID
I don’t mind appearing in Rolling
Stone, but I don’t want to appear in
Rolling Stone as somebody who wants to
be in Rolling Stone. If you see me
like, you know, a guest on a game show
in a couple of years...
Lipsky laughs.

Pause.

David is pensive again.

DAVID
To have written a book about how
seductive image is, and how many ways
there are to get seduced off any kind
of meaningful path, because of the way
the culture is now...? What if I
become this parody of that very thing?
Lipsky looks at David, who stares straight ahead, his eyes
maybe filling with tears.
DAVID
Tomorrow, you drive away, get on a
plane, this is over. And I’m back to
knowing like twenty people. Then I’m
going to have to like decompress from
getting all this attention. Because
it’s like getting heroin injected into
your cortex.
That registers with Lipsky.

71.
DAVID (CONTD)
And where I’m going to need real balls
is to be able to sit and go through
that. And try to remind myself that
what the reality is: that I’m thirtyfour years old, and I’m alone in a
room with a piece of paper.
They drive in silence.
97

EXT./INT. DAVID'S HOUSE - 1996 - NIGHT
The Grand Am pulls up, its headlights the only artificial
light. The Davids get out and remove their bags. Inside,
the dogs are barking in anticipation.
David unlocks the door and the dogs greet him and Lipsky
exuberantly. David kneels so that the dogs lick his face.
DAVID
(in an Elvis voice)
I’m never leavin’ you again, I swear.
David looks around the carpet.
DAVID
Shit Check.
(discovers some)
Ah! Look what you did.
The dogs sheepishly watch David clean up their shit.
DAVID
Happens to the best of us, eh, boy?
Never fails. Wait to do your thing
after the dog-sitter leaves.
(to Lipsky)
Be sure your Rolling Stone readers
learn about that.
David prepares to put on some music.
Lipsky approaches.

Tape recorder in hand,

LIPSKY
Uh. Hey. So, I’m leaving tomorrow
and, I’ve got to ask you about this
rumor...
DAVID
Is this the heroin thing?
thing again?
Yeah.

LIPSKY

The heroin

97

72.
DAVID
It isn’t true. What is so hard for
you to believe?
LIPSKY
The reason it is so hard to believe is
because there is so much about drugs
and addiction in the book...
DAVID
That doesn’t mean it’s
autobiographical, the drug stuff in
the book is basically a metaphor.
Look at you. You don’t fucking
believe a word I’m saying, do you.
LIPSKY
I didn’t say that.
DAVID
I was not, I never was a heroin
addict.
LIPSKY
Okay. The rumor I heard... was that
in the late ‘80s, when you were at
Harvard, you'd gotten involved with
drugs and had some kind of
breakdown...
DAVID
I don't know if I had a breakdown, I
got really really depressed. I told
you that. It had nothing to do with
drugs. I mean, I'm somebody who spent
most of his life in libraries. I never
lived that kind of dangerous life. I
wouldn't even stick a needle into my
arm.
LIPSKY
Okay, so how do you think that rumor
got started?
DAVID
I have no idea! I have no idea.
LIPSKY
Alright... Calm down...

73.
DAVID
To tell you truly, if you structured
this as some “and then he spiraled
into some terrible addiction thing,”
it would be inaccurate. It was more
like, I got more and more unhappy. The
more unhappy I would get, the more I
would drink. There was no joy in the
drinking. I used it for anesthesia.
Okay?
LIPSKY
Okay. What kind of drinker were you?
Were you a falling-down drinker? A
waking-up-in-the-curb drinker?
DAVID
No, I was not! Okay? Part of my
reticence about this whole thing is
that it won't make very good copy for
you. Because, no, I was not like that
at all!
LIPSKY
You did agree to this interview.
DAVID
I know that I did.
LIPSKY
Alright, I'm not gonna push much
further.
DAVID
I'm also aware that some addictions
are sexier than others. My primary
addiction my entire life has been to
television. I told you that. Now,
television addiction is of far less
interest to your readers than
something like heroin, that confirms
the mythos of the writer LIPSKY
A myth I do not believe, okay?
DAVID
I know you don't believe that. I’m
also aware that one of the things
swirling around here is you want the
best fucking article you can have!

74.
Why don’t you write whatever the fuck
you want, but the fact of the matter
is, it was not a Lost Weekend sort of
thing. Nor was it some lurid, romantic
writer-as-alcoholic-sort-of-thing.
What it was, was a 28-year-old person
who exhausted a couple other ways to
live, really taken them to their
conclusion. Which for me was a pink
room, with a drain in the center of
the floor. Which is where they put me
for an entire day when they thought I
was going to kill myself. Where you
don’t have anything on, and somebody’s
observing you through a slot in the
wall. And when that happens to you,
you become tremendously...
unprecedentedly willing to examine
some other alternatives for how to
live.
David looks at him for a moment. He walks out of the room,
leaving Lipsky behind, his head reeling. Lipsky presses stop
on the tape recorder.

INT. DAVID'S HOUSE/BATHROOM - 1996 - NIGHT

Lipsky, still digesting the conversation, looks at himself in
the mirror while brushing his teeth. He spits into the sink.
101

INT. DAVID'S HOUSE/GUEST ROOM - 1996 - NIGHT

101

Lipsky is in bed, still awake in the moonlight. The door
ajar, David comes in. He speaks softly, in shadow. He can’t
be seen and can’t see Lipsky very well; it’s sort of like
confession.
You awake?
Yeah.

DAVID
LIPSKY

DAVID
I was just thinking... It wasn't a
chemical imbalance, and it wasn't
drugs and alcohol. It was much more
that I had lived an incredibly
American life. That, “If I could just
achieve X and Y and Z, everything
would be OK.”
(A beat.)

75.
There's a thing in the book: when
people jump out of a burning
skyscraper, it's not that they're not
afraid of falling anymore, it's that
the alternative is so awful. And then
you're invited to consider what could
be so awful, that leaping to your
death seems like an escape from it. I
don't know if you've had any
experience with this kind of thing.
But it's worse than any kind of
physical injury. It may be what in
the old days was known as a spiritual
crisis. Feeling as though every axiom
of your life turned out to be false,
and there was actually nothing, and
you were nothing, and it was all a
delusion. And that you were better
than everyone else because you saw
that it was a delusion, and yet you
were worse because you can't fucking
function. And it’s really horrible.
(A beat.)
I don’t think we ever change. I’m
sure there are still those same parts
of me. I’ve just got to find a way
not to let them drive. Y’know?
(A beat.)
Well, anyway... Good night.
LIPSKY
Good night.
David goes. Lipsky, his eyes moist, scrambles to get his pad
and scribbles notes so he won’t forget David at his most
revealing.

David and Lipsky are out on a wintry field, walking the dogs.

76.
DAVID
Jeeves, Drone, come! You get
instantaneous production from the
Jeevester; Drone’s a much tougher nut.
LIPSKY
Beautiful out here.
DAVID
You should see: in the spring, when
the wind blows, you can see ripples,
it’s like water. It’s like the ocean,
except it’s real green. I mean, it
really is. Calm, real pretty.
(Pause.) Hungry?
LIPSKY
You know me.
They turn back toward the house.

David calls the dogs.

DAVID
You should get going.
LIPSKY
Yeah. Let me take you someplace nice
this time. Remember, it’s on Jann.

Lipsy and David emerge. David tucks into the takeout bag.
DAVID
Sorry, I can’t wait, I’m suddenly
starving, I gotta eat something.
David picks pickles off his bacon double cheeseburger.
LIPSKY
You don’t like pickles.
DAVID
Oh, come on. Now the whole world will
know what my mother’s known for years:
I’m a picky eater?
He takes a bite.

The dogs are in David and Lipsky’s faces while the men eat.

77.
DAVID
Jeeves, sit! You see, Jeeves gets
very obedient when food is around.
You sit, Drone. It should be clear by
now that you’re not getting any of
this.
Drone sits.

David feeds both dogs morsels of his food.

DAVID
Good dog! There you go, thatta boy.
(to Lipsky) Don’t leave food within
their reach - they will eat it.
Lipsky takes a note.
DAVID
You’re not gonna make me look like one
of those insane old women who talk to
their dogs, are you?
LIPSKY
Don’t worry.
DAVID
I am worried: my dogs’ll be offended.
LIPSKY
Your dogs are not gonna read it.
Drone playfully nudges Lipsky to the floor.
DAVID
Wow - he’s never taken to a male like
he’s taken to you.
LIPSKY

Really?

DAVID
Except for me, of course.
The phone rings.

David hands Lipsky his burger.

Hold this?
Sure.

DAVID
LIPSKY

David goes to get the phone.
DAVID
(on the phone) Hello?

Oh, hey.

78.
He turns away from Lipsky and lowers his voice but Lipsky can
still hear him.
DAVID
Yeah, I would like to. I can’t right
now. I’ve got this guy here.
Lipsky is stung: After all the intimacy they shared, Lipsky
is just “this guy.”
DAVID
The Rolling Stone guy. Yeah. Well, he
should be leaving pretty soon. Can I
just meet you there? Okay? Great.
See you there. Bye.
He hangs up.

Lipsky tries not to show his hurt.

LIPSKY
I should get out of here, let you get
on with your life.
DAVID
Just this friend. This dance I like
to go to, with this friend.
You dance?

LIPSKY

DAVID
Uh huh. I’ve just discovered in the
last few years that I really like it.
Although I’m still not very good.
LIPSKY
What kind of dancing?
DAVID
I tend to do the Jerk, the Swim,
cheesy 70s disco.
Really?

LIPSKY

DAVID
The nice thing about Bloomington?
You’re completely hip if you do that.
LIPSKY
Where do you go, a club?
DAVID
This Baptist church.

79.
Lipsky can’t tell if David is serious.
Why there?

DAVID
Because Baptists can dance.
Wow.

David grabs his coat and gloves and goes outside. Soon we
hear the sound of David scraping ice off his car, which is
heard throughout the following:

Lipsky goes from room to room, as if memorizing this time and
place, softly describing what he sees into his recorder.

toys, chew toys. Crap stains on
carpet. Shark doll on bookcase.
American flag. Alanis. Coal-burning
fireplace. Brick wall. Fake woodpaneling. Soda cans. Lots of ‘em.

Lipsky sees the door to David’s office, ajar for the first
time. He pushes his way in and discovers a darkened room. He
looks around quietly, barely breathing, sees the partially
illuminated keyboard and computer. He goes to the closed
drapes, pushes them aside and squints as he takes in the
brilliant snowy field.

The scraping is still heard. Lipsky packs clothes, a loafer,
and stops when he sees his book, The Art Fair. He looks at
his author’s photo.
113

EXT. DAVID'S HOUSE - 1996 - DAY
His book in hand, Lipsky trudges through the snow and finds
David systematically scraping away at his car.
DAVID
Driving that rental of yours? The
feeling of gliding? This shit box
dudn’t even have shock absorbers.
LIPSKY
What is it?
DAVID
‘85 Nissan Sentra. I know it doesn’t
look like much, but, man, this thing
starts. It’s actually a problem.
LIPSKY

Why?

DAVID
I gotta get a new one but I can’t junk
this.
Why not?

LIPSKY

DAVID
It’s my friend.
Ah.

LIPSKY

Pause.
LIPSKY
Hey, David, I, uh...
Lipsky shyly presents David with a copy of his book.
Wow.

DAVID
Just happened to have it on you?

LIPSKY
I debated whether or not I should I do
this.

113

82.

Why not?

DAVID

LIPSKY
I don’t know, you don’t think this is
like some kid-brother sort of thing to
do?
DAVID
No. Thanks, man, I look forward to
reading it.
LIPSKY
You’re welcome. I wrote my address
and e-mail on the flyleaf.
DAVID
I’ll read it soon as I’m done with the
Heinlein and I’ll send you a note.
Great.

LIPSKY
Thanks.

David flips through the book.
DAVID
I’ll be curious to see what it’s like
being inside your head for a change.
I like your cover.
LIPSKY
Yeah, me, too. I had them use the
cover art for the British edition.
DAVID
Come on. You got approval but I - ?
(stops himself)
It’s nice. It’s very nice.
Lipsky puts his bag in the Grand Am and slams the trunk.
LIPSKY
Hey, isn’t it reassuring that a lot of
people are reading you and saying
you’re a really strong writer?
DAVID
It’d be very interesting to talk to
you in a few years.
LIPSKY
Why do you say that?

83.
DAVID
‘Cause my own experience is that
that’s not so. The more people think
that you’re really good, actually the
bigger the fear of being a fraud is.
The worst thing about having a lot of
attention paid to you, is that you’re
afraid of bad attention. If bad
attention hurts you, then the calibre
of the weapon that’s pointed at you
has gone way up. Like from a .22 to a
.45. But there’s a part of me that
wants a lot of attention. And that
thinks I’m really good, and wants
other people to see it. It’s one of
the ways I think we’re sort of alike,
you know?
Uh huh.

LIPSKY

Lipsky smiles and nods.

Pause.

LIPSKY
(in farewell) Well...
Lipsky’s awkward attempt at a hug - unreciprocated by David turns into a clumsy handshake. Lipsky gets into the car.
David stands at his window.
DAVID
I’m not so sure you want to be me.
I don’t?

LIPSKY

DAVID
(A beat. He smiles.)
Send my best to “Jann.”
David shuts the door. Lipsky starts the car and pulls away
while David returns to scraping his car.

Lipsky beholds a parcel. The return address is “Dave

box and peels away newspaper to reveal: A SINGLE LOAFER. And
a message written on a post-it: “Yours, I presume?”
Accompanied by a smiley face. Nothing on the reverse.
Nothing else in the box. That’s all. Huh. Lipsky smiles in

We are both so young. He wants
something better than he has; I want

LIPSKY (V.O.) (CONT’D)
David thought books existed to stop
you from feeling lonely. If I could,
I’d say to David that living those

is like -- instead of being a relief

feel much less alone.
