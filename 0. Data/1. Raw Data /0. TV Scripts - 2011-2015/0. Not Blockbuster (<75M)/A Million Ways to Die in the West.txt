About the Author

Albert Stark was a coward. Not a
quivering, jittery, weak-kneed sort
of a coward, but the kind who
viewed his cowardice as an act of
sensibility: a coward in the name
of pragmatism. To Albert, his
cowardice functioned as a shield
that existed to service the very
sensible goal of self-preservation.
In the West, brave men got killed.
Cowards stayed alive.
Death was everywhere on the
frontier.
“Everything that’s not you wants
you dead,” Albert would often say.

“Outlaws, Indians, angry gamblers,
disgruntled
prostitutes,
wild
animals, the weather, disease—
hell, even a trip to the dentist
means taking your fucking life in
your hands.”
One needed only to glance at the
front page of any local newspaper
to see the truth in such a point of
view:

Yes, it seemed to Albert that fear
was a very useful thing for a man
living in the southern Arizona
territory.
So on this blistering hot day he
was quite content to once again
allow cowardice to insulate him
from an early demise.

He stood at the center of the
thoroughfare, gun belt at the ready
—or so it appeared. The townsfolk
of Old Stump lined the street, eager
as ever to witness that most
electrifying
of
all
frontier
spectacles: the showdown. But at
the moment, Albert stood alone.
His opponent was nowhere to be
seen, and high noon had o cially
come and gone. No one spoke, save
for
the
occasional
uttering
murmurs of slightly confused
anticipation from the onlookers.
Dirt farmers watched patiently.
Women
fanned
themselves,
desperately attempting to force a

few little bursts of air between
their numerous layers of clothing.
Well-to-do gentlemen checked their
pocket watches and smoked the
sort of ne cigars one can only
truly enjoy outdoors in 112-degree
weather. Children
dgeted and
played idly with their favorite toys,
such as apple cores, bits of string,
and deceased mice. Dogs lay
panting on the ground, no doubt
wondering how the fuck any
human being could live a nonsuicidal existence in such an awful,
depressing place.
Albert tried to avoid eye contact
with the surrounding spectators,

aside from the occasional shared
glance with a strikingly beautiful
blond-haired woman who stood on
the steps in front of the general
store. She o ered him a wan smile,
perhaps meant to be reassuring but
with a seemingly dubious degree of
conviction.
And then, at last, they heard the
sound of approaching hoofbeats.
Very faint and distant at rst, then
more distinct, until nally a man
rode into view at the opposite end
of the thoroughfare. He slowed his
horse with a sharp yank on the
reins that appeared to startle the
animal, though it came to an

obedient halt. The man dismounted
and moved with a decided lack of
urgency into position at the end of
the street.
Albert sti ened and regarded his
opponent. Charlie Blanche and
Albert Stark could not have been
more
contrasting
in
their
deportment:
Blanche
was
a
grizzled, weathered-looking mass
of aggression, who looked as
though he hadn’t smiled since the
days of Lewis and Clark. He glared
at Albert with an expression that
seemed to say, I want to shoot you in
the dick with a bullet made of cancer.
Albert cleared his throat. “So … I

guess high noon to you means
12:15?”
Charlie stared blankly for a beat.
“What?”
“Well,” said Albert, genuinely
annoyed in spite of his fear, “I
mean, you said high noon, and I
was here, and … I’ve sort of just
been waiting.”
Blanche narrowed his eyes
darkly. “I’m here now.”
“Yeah, I know, but it’s just—it’s
like sort of inconsiderate, because
it’s like you’re saying that your
time is more valuable than
everyone else’s, and … well, I
know everybody here has like a full

day, and they all took time o to
be here, and—I mean, right,
everyone?”
No one answered. Albert looked
around furtively in search of a
supportive face but found none.
His gaze landed on a toothless old
man who did not look like he had a
full day at all. The man stared
emptily, his tongue sliding along
the perimeter of his solitary tooth,
like a sentry dutifully patrolling
the last remaining outpost of an
all-but-defeated army.
“Draw,” said Charlie Blanche.
A wave of renewed alertness
swept over the onlookers as they

shared a collective inhalation. Now
the show would begin!
Albert took a deep breath of his
own. “Um … no.”
A perplexed buzzing from the
townsfolk.
The pretty
blond
woman regarded Albert with a look
of confused dismay.
“What do you mean, no?”
Blanche narrowed his eyes further,
nearly squinting them out of
existence.
Albert took another deep breath.
“I … I don’t wanna do this. You’re
a way better shot than me, and so
before this gets outta hand and we
both get all crazy and dead here,

I … I don’t wanna have a shootout.”
“You yellow, Stark?” The corner
of Blanche’s mouth twisted into a
perversion of a half smile—no
doubt the warmest expression his
long-rotted
disposition
would
accommodate.
“Well, look, yellow is kind of a”—
Albert paused uneasily—“I mean,
that’s kind of racist to our
hardworking friends from the Far
East, right, guys?”
He turned to a small cluster of
Chinese railroad workers watching
from o to the side. Surely now
he’d get a small boost of support.

The shortest Chinaman gave him
the finger.
“O-okay,”
Albert
stuttered.
“Welcome.”
Blanche barked out a gravelly
laugh. “Even the damn Chinese
know you’re yellow!”
Albert turned back to face his
adversary. “Look, I—I just wanna
resolve things more reasonably,
okay? I mean, we’re both
intelligent adults, right? So … I’m
just gonna pay you for the
damages.”
Blanche’s expression did not
change. “Suits me ne. That’s fty
dollars.”

“Right, okay,” said Albert,
fidgeting slightly.
“Now, here’s the thing … I don’t
have fifty dollars in cash—”
Charlie’s hand moved toward the
butt of his gun.
“—but … I will give you twentyfive sheep.”
Charlie’s index nger was almost
touching the trigger. “I don’t want
sheep, Stark.”
Heat
sweat
was
suddenly
interfused with panic sweat as
Albert realized he was in trouble.
“Well, this—this is a lotta sheep.
This is like twenty- ve sheep. Like
a whole … gaggle. A pack? Is it a

pack?” He laughed anxiously as his
oundering
brain
let loose a
diarrhetic stream of nonsense. “Oh,
my God, can you believe this?! I’m
a sheep farmer, and I’m totally
blanking on the plural—is it a
school of sheep? I don’t know! Ha!
Hey, you know what a group of
ferrets is called? A business. A
business of ferrets. English is fun,
’cause there’s all kinds of secret
treasures—”
The crack of a bullet split the air
as Charlie Blanche red a shot at
Albert’s feet. Albert jumped back
with a distinctly feminine shriek.
“Your goddamn sheep grazed up

half my ranch, Stark! That grass
ain’t never gonna grow back.”
There was a deep-rooted hatred
for sheepmen among the cattle
ranchers of the West, largely
because the sheep themselves
grazed in such a deep-rooted
fashion. They would devour the
grass so close to the ground that, if
left
unchecked,
they
could
e ectively strip a pasture bare to
the point that the grass had to be
resown. No cow can graze where a
sheep has been, the cattlemen
would declare. As a result, range
wars often broke out between
cattle and sheep farmers, with

terribly bloody consequences. It
also didn’t help that sheepmen
were generally considered huge
pussies.
Albert swallowed what little
saliva he had left as Charlie raised
his gun and took aim.
“Okay, okay!” Albert threw up
his hands in a gesture of surrender.
“I’ll sell o the sheep myself, all
right? I’ll get you the money! Ookay? You’ll have it tomorrow.”
There was a terrifying moment
during which Albert was certain
that, even though he had truckled
to
his
opponent’s
demands,
Blanche would pull the trigger. But,

instead, the other man slowly
lowered the pistol. “If I don’t have
that cash, I’m comin’ after you.
And I’ll shoot you three times:
forehead, nose, and chin, so your
head splits clean in half like a
fairground watermelon.”
“Oh, and I would deserve it,”
Albert blurted obsequiously. “In
that scenario? Oh, my God, what a
jerk I would be. But I—that’s not
the kind of guy I am, so I—I’ll get
you your money.”
Charlie
Blanche
carefully
holstered his weapon. Albert let
loose a quivering exhale as Blanche
moved back toward his horse. I’m

so glad I didn’t pee, thought Albert,
feeling an aftershock of panic over
how truly close he’d come to death.
He turned and walked back up the
street, his legs feeling like they
were made of jam—
CRACK!!
The townsfolk gasped. Albert
collapsed to the ground as an
unimaginably cutting pain blasted
through his ankle. “FUCK!” he
screamed as he turned in shock.
Charlie had shot him.
“Just a little taste,” said Blanche
in
a
soft,
deadly tone. He
reholstered his pistol, mounted his
horse, and loped o
without

another word.
And almost immediately the
townsfolk began to disperse as if
nothing
had
happened.
The
entertainment was over. Everyone
casually returned to their day as if
they’d just
nished watching a
sideshow in a traveling carnival—
never mind the fact that a man had
barely avoided losing his life mere
moments before.
A pudgy, slightly balding man in
his mid-thirties hurried to where
Albert lay clutching his foot in
pain.
“Aw, man, Albert! You okay?”
Albert had never been shot

before, but he’d witnessed men
who had. And those little metal
pellets could do some horri cally
gruesome damage. He sucked in a
sharp breath of air as he steeled
himself and pulled back his trouser
leg.
Though the pain
was
intolerable, a look of surprise came
over his face as he registered the
super ciality of the wound. It had
pierced the skin, but not by much.
Jesus, how the hell bad must the pain
be from a dead-on shot?
“It’s—it’s ne, it’s just grazed,”
Albert said, pulling his trouser leg
back down.
“Oh,
thank
God.” Edward

breathed a sigh of relief.
Edward Phelps was a kind-eyed,
mild-mannered cobbler and Albert’s
closest friend. Out on the frontier,
however, that didn’t necessarily
mean an inseparable bond. In a
town of fewer than seventy- ve
people, your choices were limited
when it came to picking a best pal.
Albert liked Edward well enough,
but it had more to do with the fact
that Edward was one of the few
people in the West who wouldn’t
shoot you for looking at him the
wrong way. Albert wasn’t sure, but
he didn’t think Edward even owned
a gun. And if he did, it would have

looked completely out of place. If
there were such a term as
aggressively a able,
that
was
Edward.
A much more imposing man
approached the center of the
thoroughfare.
“You all right, Stark?” Sheri
Arness inquired without expression.
“Yeah,
I’m
ne,”
Albert
responded. “Oh, hey, listen, Sheri ,
I wanna thank you for your help.
Appreciate you stepping in and
halting this deadly altercation
going on right in front of your
o ce. Really terri c, thanks for
the support.”

The sheri looked at Albert with
coldness. “It’s not my place to
intervene, Stark. I believe a man
should fight his own battles.”
Albert stared for a beat. This guy
was everything that was fucked up
about the frontier, all wrapped up
in one tough-eyed, sunburned
package sealed with a tin star.
“You’re the sheri ,” Albert said,
trying not to sound too much like
he was talking to a five-year-old.
“That’s right.”
“So … the one thing we’re all
paying you to do—like, the one
function you have in town—you’re
saying everyone else should do it.”

“I’m
not
your
goddamn
bodyguard, Stark.”
Once again, Albert resisted the
urge to sound as if he were
teaching a class of retarded
children. “Well, actually, yes. See,
as the sheri , it’s technically kind
of your job to protect my body
from harm.”
“Yeah, it is kinda your job,”
Edward chimed in, always the
faithful, supportive pal who didn’t
know when to keep his mouth
closed.
“Shut up,” the sheri snapped,
and Edward quickly lowered his
head and shu ed aside timidly.

The sheri turned back to Albert. “I
guess you and I see things
differently.”
“So, like, if you opened a
restaurant, would you wait for
people to come in and then say, ‘A
man should cook his own food’?”
“You’d best watch your tongue,
or you’re gonna nd yourself in a
jail cell.”
“Oh, there we go!” Albert threw
up his arms, the stress and pain of
the day exploding in an outburst of
aggravation. “The long arm of the
law nally lashes out to protect
itself against pissy people!”
The sheri
just glared. “You

should see Doctor Harper about
that ankle,” he said at last, turning
away stiffly.
Albert expelled a pained sigh of
defeat, struggled to pull himself up
from the dirt, and limped o
toward the doctor’s office.
Frontier medicine was essentially
an oxymoron.
The big city hospitals in 1882
were bad enough, but they
exempli ed the cutting edge of
science compared to what sort of
treatment you got out West.
The medical o ce of Doctor
Matthew Harper, the only licensed

practicing physician in the town of
Old Stump, was a glori ed shack.
His hand-painted shingle swayed
and creaked in the hot, dusty wind
—a ne indication of the kind of
care you could expect if you fell ill
in this little community. Inside, the
wooden shelves were lined with
various bottles of medicines, elixirs,
tonics—but who the hell was
anybody kidding? It was all just
liquor. On the frontier, medicine
was merely booze with a fancy
label.
Doctor Harper stood over the
body of his patient. She was a
woman in her forties, hard-lined

and graying. She lay unconscious
from the doctor’s ether, which was
a good thing, since her abdomen
was sliced wide open. Doctor
Harper’s hands were covered in
blood as he meticulously worked
away at her insides, using all the
skills his dental training had
provided him. A mangy-looking
housecat leapt up onto the
operating table, sni ng at the
body.
“Oh, come on, now, you know
you’re not supposed to be up here,”
Doctor Harper chuckled, scooping
up the cat and placing him gently
on the oor. “You run along now,

Jesus, you hear?” The doctor’s
hands left smears of blood on the
cat’s fur, at which it eagerly
lapped. Harper returned to his
work, brushing the errant feline
hairs off the table.
“Hello?” came a voice from the
outer room. “Doctor Harper?”
Harper wiped his hands on a rag,
tossed it on his patient’s leg, and
strolled into the outer room. Albert
had already seated himself in a
chair, eager to take the weight o
his injured limb.
“Hi, Doc,” he said. “I was
wondering if—holy
shit.” He
stopped
mid-sentence
as
he

registered Doctor Harper’s hands,
which were still shiny with fresh
crimson blood.
“Oh, don’t mind this,” Doctor
Harper reassured him. “I’m just in
the middle of surgery.”
“I can come back,” Albert said,
moving toward the door.
“No, no, she’ll be out for a while.
It’s Mrs. Callaghan, poor woman.
Her stomach devil was about to
explode, so I had to take it out.”
It took Albert a beat to decipher
that one. “Her appendix?”
“Yep, that’s the fella,” the doctor
answered.
Albert wondered why he had

even come here. A trip to the
doctor’s o ce was likely to turn a
hangnail into a desperate struggle
for survival.
“Now, what’s the trouble?”
Doctor Harper asked, allowing
himself a swallow from one of the
bottles on the shelf. No doubt such
frequent behavior contributed to
the heavily seamed face and
unhealthy pallor that brought to
mind Luke 4:23: Physician, heal
thyself.
“Uh, it’s a bullet graze. Just need
it checked out.”
“Oh, yeah.” The doctor smiled
with a gossip-hungry glint in his

eye. “I heard you turned yellow on
Charlie Blanche.”
“Well, Doc, I know you’d rather
be patching up a gaping chest
wound than a minor graze, but
unfortunately I value my life. Now,
you wanna take a look at this, or
should I limp out into the desert
and let the fucking coyotes have at
it?”
“All right, let’s have a look.”
Doctor Harper laughed goodnaturedly. The doctor rolled up
Albert’s trouser leg, his hands
leaving light bloody smears on the
fabric, courtesy of Mrs. Callaghan.
“I notice you’re not big on the

hand-washing,” Albert remarked
listlessly. The doctor either ignored
the comment or was too busy
focusing on the injury.
“Ooh, that’s a nasty one,” he
observed, examining the wound.
“We may have to take that o ,
otherwise you could wind up with a
case of toe-foot.”
Albert sighed. “Okay, rst of all,
I don’t think that’s a real thing,
and second of all, it’s a graze, Doc.
I’m not gonna let you cut my foot
off.”
“Suit yourself. But I’ve seen toefoot turn into knee-leg in less than
a week.”

“Just a dressing, thanks,” Albert
responded curtly, now even more
anxious to get this over with as
quickly as possible.
Doctor Harper pulled open a
drawer and retrieved a roll of
bandages as Albert surveyed the
small o ce. The remains of a roast
chicken were scattered on a plate
next to an open jar of laudanum,
and a recently lit cigar sat
precariously on the edge of a side
table, its pointy tip still darkened
with saliva. As for any sign of
o cial physician’s credentials, the
sole candidate hung in a wooden
frame on the far wall.

“Texas Territory Medical College,”
Albert read the handwritten
diploma aloud as the doctor went
to work on his leg. “So, is that a
pretty prestigious place?”
“Yessir, third in my class,”
Harper answered with genuine
pride.
“Ah. And was this an indoor
medical school?” Albert asked
without a trace of sarcasm or
irony.
“All right, there we go,” said the
doctor, straightening up and
smiling down at the new dressing.
“Try to stay off it for a bit.”
Albert looked at the results. “Just

a dry cloth bandage? That’s it?”
“Well, what else would you like
me to do?”
“Clean
it,
maybe?” Albert
answered, feigning patience. “So I
don’t get an infection and die?”
“Well, now, that’s up to the Lord
God.”
Albert stared for a beat. “I guess
I’m looking for someone more
reliable.”
They wished each other good day
as Jesus the cat helped himself to
Mrs. Callaghan’s large intestine.
On any given evening, the Old
Stump Saloon was packed to the

gills with gamblers, boozers, and
unshaven purveyors of various foul
smells. At times, in fact, there
seemed to be virtually hundreds of
di erent
odors,
all
ercely
competing for dominance in the
con ned and poorly ventilated
space.
But at two o’clock in the
afternoon, the place was mostly
deserted. A couple of frail-looking
old cowhands sat at the bar staring
into their glasses, but otherwise the
lower level was empty.
Except for Edward Phelps.
Edward sat patiently on a
wooden chair at the base of the

stairwell that led up to the brothel
rooms. He probably should have
brought a book or something, he
thought, but the wait wouldn’t be
too long. In his hand he held a
lovely late-spring bouquet of
daisies, lilacs, and da odils. From
upstairs, the raucous sounds of
sexual intercourse could be heard
as Edward’s girlfriend, Ruth, was
fucked wildly by a dirty cowboy.
“Oh, yes! YES!!” she screamed,
her voice reverberating throughout
the saloon.
“Yeah, you like me fuckin’ you,
don’t you?” bellowed the dirty
cowboy.

“Yes! Yes, it’s really terri c!” she
shouted back between moans of
ecstasy.
“I got dirt on my dick from
workin’ outside all day!”
“I know! I love the scratchy
feeling inside me!”
“Yeah, you like the dirt on my
dick, don’t you?!”
“I do! I really do! It’s such a
treat!”
Ruth’s sex talk had always been
a bit clumsy, but her heart was in
the right place, and as a prostitute
she was exemplary: always on time
for her shift, freshly bathed after
every fth customer, and willing to

accommodate all types of fetishes.
Edward admired her work ethic.
The seriousness with which a
person
took
professional
obligations said a lot about their
character. He was lucky to be with
such a woman.
“Stick your
nger in my
asshole!” shouted the dirty cowboy.
“I’m excited to!” Ruth answered.
At that moment, Millie, the house
madam, descended the stairs. She
was plump, in her early forties,
with the saucy, painted look of a
career saloon whore. Her thick
mound of done-up hair, no doubt
once dark as onyx, now showed

numerous streaks of gray. As she
approached, she waved a beringed
hand in the cobbler’s direction.
“Hi, Edward,” she said with a
smile. Her cherry-red lips and
heavily rouged cheeks, while
undigni ed-looking in and of
themselves, at least added some
welcome color to the brown-onbrown room.
“Oh, hey, Millie.” Edward
grinned, standing respectfully.
“You waiting for Ruth?”
“Yeah, I got o work a little
early, so I thought I’d take her out
for a picnic.”
“Oh. You’re a good boyfriend.”

“I try to be.”
Millie glanced toward the upper
level. “Well, it sounds like she’s
almost done,” she said, as the
moans of orgasmic passion reached
a dissonant crescendo.
“OH, GOD, I’M GONNA COME!”
Ruth screamed.
“Those are pretty owers,” Millie
remarked.
Edward looked down at his
bouquet with a proud grin. “I
know, aren’t they beautiful? There
are even a couple of tulips in here.
They’re hard to come by this time
of year, but Ruth is very
particular.”

“OH, YES! SHOOT THAT DIRTY
COWBOY CUM ALL OVER MY
FACE!”
Edward adjusted his tie, hearing
that Ruth was almost nished. “Do
I look all right?” he asked,
presenting himself to Millie for
inspection.
“Yes, you’re … you’re ne,” she
answered, unable to contain her
curiosity
any
longer.
“Say,
Edward … can I ask you
something?”
“Sure.”
“Are you … okay with the fact
that your girlfriend gets screwed by
about fteen guys every day and

gets paid to do it?”
“Oh. Well, I mean, my job sucks
too.”
“Yeah, but you repair shoes.”
“Ugh, don’t remind me!” Edward
laughed. “The shoe business has
been so slow since the Civil War
ended.”
“Really?”
“Yeah, there’s just a lot less
legs.”
Millie was about to press the
original issue a bit further, when
Ruth came bounding down the
stairs, still in the process of pulling
her clothes back on.
“Eddie, is that you?” she

squealed happily.
He whirled around to meet her
eyes and ung his arms wide open.
“Hey, sweetheart!”
“What are you doing here?” she
exclaimed, smothering him in a
joyous embrace and kissing him
flush on the lips.
He inched. “Ooh, your breath is
a little …”
“Sorry—I had to give a blow
job.” She covered her mouth, her
already red cheeks coloring just a
bit more.
Edward smiled with genuine
understanding. “That’s okay. Hey, I
got done a little early, and I

thought we could go for a walk out
by the stream.”
Ruth hugged him all over again
for his thoughtfulness. “Ohhh, you
are the best! Yeah, c’mon, let’s go!”
She gave him a peck on the cheek,
then looked at Millie. “Don’t I have
the best boyfriend in the world?”
Millie opened her mouth to
respond, but nothing seemed
fitting.
“Bye!” Ruth giggled, pulling a
beaming Edward by the hand
toward the saloon doors. “What
time should I be back?” she asked,
turning briefly back to Millie.
“Well, Clyde Hodgkins wanted to

know if he could come by later on.”
“Oh—what’s he want?” Ruth
asked.
“I think he wants anal.”
Ruth
whirled
around
and
grabbed Edward’s hands. “Oh,
honey! We could a ord to get you
a new belt for church!”
Edward’s eyes widened as he
registered his good fortune. “Wow,
that’d be great!”
“I know!” Ruth erupted with
delight, squeezing his hands and
swinging them back and forth in a
dancerly fashion.
“So, what time will you need
her? 5:30 or so?” Edward asked

Millie.
“Well, this isn’t really like a
dentist’s o ce, Edward. He’ll
probably stop in when he’s ready
to put his penis inside an asshole.”
“Okay, we’ll say 5:00 just to be
safe,” Edward said. And, with that,
the couple hurried out into the
afternoon sunlight, their love for
each
other
outshining
the
brightness of the day.
Deadcow Bridge had earned its
name back around the time that
Old Stump’s rst settlers rode west
with dreams of making a new life
for themselves. In addition to its

human complement, the wagon
train had brought with it two
hundred head of beef cattle. But
when the settlers reached the
southwestern Arizona territory, the
herd
had
succumbed to
a
mysterious
illness
and
was
decimated within a matter of days.
In light of their misfortune, the
weary pioneers decided to halt
their westward journey and build
their community on the spot. The
terrain was somewhat rocky and
not particularly forgiving, but the
discovery of a nearby river
revealed more desirable land
beyond. However, when the

company tried to cross the river,
they found it to be too deep. A lack
of passable shallows for some
distance in either direction left the
group stymied and frustrated. Then
one of the wives came up with a
novel solution: The settlers dragged
all the cow corpses down to the
river, and piled them up in the
water. After a time, the pile
became high enough that the
settlers could use it as a bridge of
sorts, allowing them to cross the
river to the land beyond, which
would eventually become Old
Stump. Of course, the massive
amount of decomposing bovine

esh in the water caused an
epidemic that quickly wiped out
the entire population. But the next
settlers who arrived built a wooden
bridge and crossed the river with
ease, where they founded the town
of Old Stump. Deadcow Bridge was
hence named in tribute to the
memory of the rst settlers, and
their tragic deaths from dead cow
water.
It was there in the cool shade of
the bridge that Albert sat sharing a
picnic of fried chicken and freshbaked bread with his girlfriend,
Louise. The two had been together
for a year and a half, and Albert

counted
himself
extremely
fortunate to have her in his life.
She was a rare beauty, even
discounting the standards of the
western frontier, where most
women
were
indistinguishable
from bears. She had all her teeth
too, which was another wondrous
anomaly. Albert would often sit on
the front porch with his arm
around Louise, counting her teeth
as they watched the setting of the
desert sun.
Louise sat on the picnic blanket,
her blond locks uttering in the
soft breeze, mimicking the gentle
purling of the river waters. Her

pale skin glowed with youth as she
nibbled absently at a piece of
bread with jam. She listened to
Albert venting his frustration over
the outcome of the day as she
gazed out at the thousand tiny
slices of white light ickering atop
the lazy river.
“—I mean, that should’ve been
the end of it, right?” he groused. “I
tell him I’ll pay him o , we go our
separate ways, and that’s it. But,
no, the guy shoots me in the foot!
Fuckin’ douche.”
He had been ranting for several
minutes before he noticed that
Louise appeared to be deliberately

avoiding eye contact.
“What’s the matter?” he asked.
Louise looked down at her hands
for a beat, then said the last thing
Albert expected to hear. “You
should’ve fought him, Albert.”
Albert stared at her with all the
comprehension of a horse being
asked to roll a cigarette. “Wait,
what?”
“You should’ve fought Charlie
Blanche.” All of a sudden, she had
no difficulty meeting his gaze.
“Wha—are you putting me on?”
“We don’t know if your sheep
grazed on his ranch,” she said. “It
could’ve been Hurley’s cows. He

should have to prove it, and he
can’t. So, I dunno … You should’ve
fought him.”
“Oh, my God, you’re serious.”
She nodded.
“Louise,” he sputtered, “the guy’s
one of the best shots in the whole
town! I mean, I look like I have
Parkinson’s next to him.”
“What’s Parkinson’s?”
“Oh, just another way God
mysteriously shows that he loves
us. Look, I tried to psych myself up
for the gun ght, but at the end of
the day I’d rather not commit
fucking suicide.”
And then, from out of nowhere,

lightning struck. “Albert … I’m
breaking up with you.”
When a parent, a sibling, or a
close friend dies suddenly, the mind
has an uncanny ability to process
the news as a mistake, or ction,
or at worst a temporary reality
that will surely correct itself in
short order. The same sort of selfdefense mechanism was activating
within Albert’s mind right now.
“Wh … what?”
“I’m sorry.” She gave him a
loving look, but it was all wrong. It
took him a moment to realize it
wasn’t love he was seeing but
rather sympathy. The look was one

you might give a hospital patient
before you told him the doctors
were unable to save his balls.
Albert opened his mouth to
speak, and what came out was, “I
got shot today.”
“I know,” she answered.
Clearly she didn’t hear what I said,
he thought.
“Ow,” he uttered, hoping that
would drive the point home.
“I’m sorry you’re hurt,” she said,
though to Albert she didn’t sound
sorry enough.
His mental gears were now
restarting their grind, and he
began to process exactly what was

happening. He was being dumped.
“Louise, I—why? Because of a
gunfight?”
“No, it’s not that. I mean, I guess
maybe it gave me the little push I
needed to nally come out and tell
you—”
“Finally? What do you mean,
nally? How long have you been
planning this?!”
“God, you make it sound so
malicious. I didn’t plan this, Albert.
But … I have been feeling this way
for a while. It’s … Look, you’re a
really great guy. I’ve just … I’ve
realized I want something else.”
The punches just kept on coming.

Albert felt like he might throw up,
and he hoped the words would beat
the vomit to his mouth. “Louise, I
love you! What else could you
want? You’re my whole life! I’ve
done everything for you for the
past year and a half! Look, I know
I’m only a sheep farmer, but I’m
saving money, and as soon as—”
“Yeah, but you’re not even a
good sheep farmer, Albert,” she
interrupted. The sympathy in her
expression was gone, and it seemed
she was now beginning to o er her
uncensored point of view. “I mean,
your sheep are everywhere. The one
thing a sheep farmer has to do is

keep all his sheep in one place. I
stopped by your farm the other
day, and there was a sheep in the
backyard, three way up on the
ridge, two in the pond, and one on
the roof.”
“That’s Bridget—she has a
problem with retardation, but she’s
full of love. Look, I think we’re
getting o -track here,” Albert said,
desperation taking over his tone.
“Louise, if it’s not about the
gun ght, tell me what it is! Tell me
what the problem is, and maybe
we can fix it!”
“Albert, you’re a good guy, for
sure,” she responded, her voice

softening once again to counter the
sting of what she was about to say.
“You’re … not good for me. I don’t
wanna date anybody right now. I
kinda have to deal with my own
shit.”
“Shit? What shit? We live in a
frontier town in the middle of the
goddamn
desert! There isn’t
enough shit around for you to have
any shit to deal with! My God,
Louise, it’s been a year and a half!
We talked about getting married!”
“Listen, if I was older, maybe the
timing would be right, but I don’t
wanna settle down yet. People are
living to be 35 these days, so a girl

doesn’t have to get married right
away. I sorta have to work on
myself right now.”
That was too much for Albert. “I
have to work on myself?” he
exclaimed. “Louise, that’s what
girls say when they have a good
thing staring them in the face and
they’re too up their own ass to
know what to do with it. I know
you. You’re not up your own ass.
You’re out here. Outside your ass.
Where I can see you. And … you’re
the most beautiful woman I’ve ever
known.”
She spread her soft, white hands
in a gesture that indicated quite

clearly that she had nothing more
to o er on the subject. “I don’t
know what else to tell you, Albert.
It’s over. I don’t want to be with
you anymore.”
His mind was locking up again.
“Wow,” he said quietly, the hurt
coating his voice with a quavering
thickness. “Louise … I love you.”
“I’m sorry.”
Then, with nothing more than a
defeated shrug, she stood up and
walked away.
And as Albert Stark sat among
the long shadows that striped the
golden
glaze of the dying
afternoon, he knew his life was

over.
The sunset streaked across the
Arizona sky, its miles and miles of
titanic painted strokes illuminating
the distant mesas, turning them a
velvety pink. To an observer
visiting the territory for the rst
time, the nightly visual feast would
have been a breathtaking sight to
behold. And though the spectacle
was a regular one for him, viewed
every evening from the front porch
of his little farmhouse, Albert
himself was not immune to its eyepopping chromatic sumptuousness.
Tonight, however, he took no

notice.
He rode toward his farm,
stricken by a deadness of limb that
twice nearly caused him to fall o
his horse. Luckily for Albert,
however, Curtis had been with him
for almost eight years, and never
was there a more reliable animal.
Any horse will adapt to the
rhythms of its rider, but equestrian
skill had deftly avoided Albert; he
was
unbalanced
and
uncoordinated. His friends had all
assumed that enough years in the
saddle would solve the problem,
but he simply had never improved.
But Curtis had. The horse would

instinctively adjust his own weight
to accommodate Albert’s lapses, an
astonishing mark of intuitive
protectiveness
that made Albert
love him more than he loved any
human being.
Except, of course, Louise.
Her face hovered before him all
the way home, the ghost of a
severed appendage. In the image,
she
burst
forth
with
an
amaranthine smile that spoke
lovingly of every shared experience
now rendered hollow. That Louise
still exists somewhere, he told
himself. I just have to nd her. Only
when he neared the farm did he

begin
to emerge from the
delusional haze. The bleating of his
sheep jerked him back to reality
with a sharp stab of sound.
Albert grappled for control of his
catatonic stare, and surveyed his
withering corral. The wooden
fences were crumbling and badly in
need of repair. And, as usual, there
were sheep all over the place.
Some were inside the corral, others
were out in the yard, and, sure
enough, there was Bridget, looking
lost and confused up on the roof.
For the life of him, Albert could not
gure out how the fuck she kept
getting up there. In his mind, he

could hear Louise’s admonishing
voice. She may have been wrong to
dump him, but she was right about
one thing: He was a shitty
sheepman.
Albert
shu ed
into
the
farmhouse and hung his hat on the
wooden peg next to the door. His
mother and father, Elsie and
George, glanced up from their
wooden chairs on the other side of
the room. For as long as Albert
could remember, they had sat in
those chairs all evening, every
evening, Elsie sewing and George
reading the Bible. And with both of
them in their early seventies, that

didn’t seem likely to change.
“You’re late,” his father grunted.
“For what?” Albert asked.
There was a pause. “Fair
enough,” his father answered, and
returned to his scripture.
That would be the extent of the
evening’s conversation. All in all, a
lively,
textured
discussion
compared to most nights.
Albert retreated into his dark
little room and knelt down to reach
under the bed. He pulled out a
small, unmarked wooden box and
carried it out to the front porch.
The sun was sinking fast below the
horizon. Albert lit a kerosene lamp

and placed it next to the rickety old
rocking chair that probably had
only another six months left before
it collapsed beneath some unlucky
behind. He sat down and opened
the box.
Inside
were
sepia-toned
memories: the grand history of the
great lovers Albert Stark and
Louise Daniels. In actuality, there
were only three pictures, but since
photographs were hard to come by,
Albert considered it a treasure
trove. As he stared longingly at the
shadows of better days frozen in
time, he heard the approaching
clip-clop of hoofbeats. He looked up

and saw Edward and Ruth
approaching in their tottery little
buggy. A happy couple, he thought,
with a twinge of resentment, then
quickly and silently chided himself
for the unwarranted burst of
negativity. These were his friends,
and they
wanted to
help.
Nonetheless, his reaction was only
human: To the man in a secure
relationship, love was a bountiful
feast to be enjoyed by all in
attendance. But to the man without
a companion, the feast was
watched bitterly from outside
through a frosted window, with the
growl of a starving belly gurgling

up from below.
Albert o ered them a bloodless
smile. “Hey, guys.”
“Albert, we just heard about
Louise,” Edward said, climbing
down from the buggy. “That’s
horrible! How are you holding up?”
“We’re so sorry,” Ruth added,
dismounting after him with what
seemed to be a wince of pain. “Are
you doing okay?”
“Not really, no,” Albert sighed,
not having the energy to lie for
their comfort. “You guys wanna sit
down?”
“Yes, thanks,” Edward said, and
pulled up a wooden stool.

“I’m okay standing,” said Ruth.
“I had a long day at work.”
Albert turned his attention back
to the pictures in his lap. “I was
just
looking
at
some
old
photographs of Louise and me.” He
held them up for his friends to see.
They gazed dutifully at the images,
even though they had seen them
many times. “This was from the
carnival.… Here we are at the
town picnic … Oh, and this was the
square dance.” His face was an
inexpressive mask, much like the
faces in the pictures. “Y’know, I
almost wish you could smile in
photographs. Louise has such an

incredible smile.”
“That’d be weird,” said Edward.
“Hm?”
Albert
answered,
distracted.
Edward shrugged. “Have you
ever smiled in a photograph?”
“No, have you?” asked Albert.
“Of course not.”
“No. You’d look like an insane
person. But I mean that …” Albert
paused, then spoke more to himself
than to Edward and Ruth. “When
she smiles it’s … I mean, even at
the peak of our relationship—you
know, that point when you’ve been
with someone awhile, and you start
taking it for granted, and it doesn’t

even occur to you that there might
be a chance you could lose her—it
would still completely paralyze me
every time she smiled.” His voice
broke just a shred. “God, I love her
so much.”
“Oh, now I feel like I’m gonna
cry,” Ruth said, pulling out a lacetrimmed
handkerchief Suddenly,
Albert couldn’t sit there any longer.
“Let’s get fucked up,” he said.
The saloon was unbearably hot
and stu y, despite the fact that the
night was relatively cool. It seemed
as if every sweaty, foul-smelling
cowboy living within ten miles of

the little frontier town was packed
into Old Stump’s utterly inadequate
recreational facility. The tiredlooking old piano player poked
and stabbed gamely at the keys of
his decaying instrument, plunking
out “Jeanie with the Light Brown
Hair,” his e orts barely audible
over the cacophonous roar of
drunken voices. A tawny whore
bent lazily over the top of the
piano, watching the clumsy dance
of his fingers.
While it was virtually impossible
for any saloon patron to avoid the
crush of bodies crammed into the
room, Albert’s table in the far

corner at least provided the
relative relief of walls. It was the
closest thing to privacy on o er at
the only establishment in town.
Albert stared into his glass of
whiskey, while Edward and Ruth
watched with friendly concern.
“So … what’re you gonna do?”
asked Edward.
“I dunno,” Albert answered, not
looking up. “Maybe I’ll kill myself.
I could do it out in the pasture, so
the sheep could eat me. They ate a
dog that died out there.”
“Ew, I thought they just ate, like,
grass and stuff.” Edward grimaced.
“Yeah, not these,” said Albert.

“There’s something wrong with
these sheep.”
Ruth put a comforting hand on
Albert’s. He smiled, but he subtly
pulled his hand away. Not because
he
didn’t
appreciate
Ruth’s
attempt, but rather because he
knew how many local rectums her
ngers had been inside. Is it
rectums or recta? he wondered.
What’s
the
plural?
Perhaps
tomorrow he would ride over to the
next town and see if they had a
dictionary. He could look up the
plural of rectum. That would be a
fun day.
“Look,” Ruth said gently, “I

know things seem hopeless right
now, but I promise there’s a lot to
live for.”
Albert drained his glass of
whiskey
and
opened
the
floodgates.
“Oh, really? What, Ruth? What is
there to live for on the American
frontier in 1882? Let me tell you
something. We live in a terrible
place and time. The American West
is a dirty, depressing, horrible,
shitty place. Everything out here
that’s not you wants to kill you.
Outlaws. Angry drunks. Scorned
hookers. Hungry animals. Diseases.
Major
injuries.
Minor injuries.

Indians. The weather. You know
how Jim Wegman the blacksmith
died? Wet socks.”
“Come on, you’re exaggerating,”
said Edward.
“I really am not exaggerating at
all,” Albert barreled on. “He went
camping, he put his foot in the
creek with his sock on, his foot
slowly rotted, and he died. Jesus,
you can get killed just by going to
the bathroom! I take my life in my
hands every time I walk to my
outhouse!
There’s
fuckin’
rattlesnakes in the grass out there,
and even if I make it, oh, hey—I
can still die from cholera! You

know cholera?”
“The Black Shit.” Edward nodded
grimly.
“The
Black
Shit!”
Albert
repeated. “The latest o ering in
the frontier’s Disease of the Month
Club.”
“I heard it started with a
Canadian railroad conductor,” Ruth
chimed in.
Albert plowed ahead. “And even
if you survive all those things, you
know what’ll kill you? The fucking
doctor. I had a cold a couple years
ago, I went in there, and he says,
‘Oh, you need an ear nail.’ A nail.
In my fucking ear. That’s modern

medicine. ‘Hey, doc, I have a fever
of 102.’ ‘Oh, you need a donkeykickin’.’ You know what else? Our
pastor has shot two people. Our
pastor.”
“Really?” said Ruth.
“Yep. Shot a guy in a duel and
then went and tracked down the
guy’s teenage son and shot him
too, ’cause he was afraid the kid
would come after him outta
revenge.”
“Wait, how do you know that?”
asked Edward skeptically.
“Because he did a whole fucking
sermon about it!! A lesson about
‘seeing things through’! Oh, by the

way, here’s something else: Look
behind you. See those guys at that
table over there? The guys who
work in the silver mines? See what
they’re eating? Ribs doused in hot
sauce.”
Sure enough, three lthy-looking
miners sat at a nearby table,
messily gnawing away at their
meals.
“That’s all they eat. Did you
know that?” said Albert. “They eat
hot, spicy foods for every meal of
the day ’cause their palates are
completely dulled and desensitized
from inhaling poison gas twelve
hours a day. All they can taste are

hot, spicy foods. You know what
that kinda diet does to your guts?
Let me tell you: constipation,
cramps,
dyspepsia,
diarrhea,
hemorrhoids, liver disease, kidney
disease, bowel in ammation—they
die from their own farts! Oh, and
speaking of death, if you wanna
see even more of that, you don’t
need to sit inside the saloon
waiting for the inevitable shootout, st ght, or full-on brawl that
breaks out once a night and usually
results in several deaths. No, all we
need to do is step outside the front
door right now!”
Strutting tipsily, Albert did his

best to cut a winding pathway
through the crowd, leading Ruth
and Edward out through the
saloon’s batwing doors. He pointed
across the street at a slumped-over
form that lay in an alleyway next
to the general store. “That is our
mayor,” he declared with pomp.
“He is dead. He has been lying
there dead for three days, and no
one has done a thing: not moved
him, not looked into his death, not
even
replaced him with a
temporary appointee. For the last
three days, our mayor, the highestranking o cial in our town, has
been a dead guy.”

Albert’s eyes suddenly widened.
“Oh! Oh, look! Look at that! The
coyotes are dragging the body
away!” Sure enough, two mangylooking
desert
coyotes
were
tugging at the mayor’s limbs with
their jaws, slowly but e ectively
dragging the corpse farther back
into the shadows of the alley.
“That is so adorable!” Albert
shouted with a big drunken grin.
“They’re gonna feed his dick to
their young! Bye, Mr. Mayor! Have
fun becoming dog poop!” With
that, Albert whirled around and
stumbled through the batwing
doors, making his way back to his

chair with a red face and a spent
soul.
“That, my friends, is the West!”
he exclaimed, as Ruth and Edward
joined him at the table, dutifully
keeping up. “A shitty, disgusting
cesspool of awfulness and despair.
Fuck all of it.”
“Why don’t you shut up,” said a
sweaty cowboy at the next table,
clearly tired of hearing the sheep
farmer complain.
“You shut up,” said Albert
reflexively.
Twenty minutes afterward, Ruth
was still dabbing at the sizable

gash on Albert’s forehead, which he
had gotten when the sweaty
cowboy
ung him through the
saloon window. Edward watched
with concern as she dipped the
already bloodied cloth back into
the horse trough to moisten it. As
for Albert, he was currently
slumped forward in a most
undigni ed fashion, allowing the
massive amount of whiskey he’d
consumed in the past ten minutes
to do its holy work of spreading
throughout his bloodstream and
obliterating both the physical and
emotional pain of the day.
“Stop it,” he slurred as he

swatted at Ruth’s hand, knocking
the reddened cloth to the dusty
ground.
“Okay,” she said, “But, you
know, you should probably have
Doctor Harper take a look at that.”
Albert glared at her with
undisguised derision. “Ruth, you’re
very sweet, but have you been
listening to a goddamn thing I’ve
been saying? You know what
Doctor Harper’ll say? He’ll say,
‘Oh, let me put a blue jay on that
to peck out the blood.’ Hey, wait,
y’know what? You guys should
have a drink with me. Let’s all
have a drink,” he said, his bearing

now ush with the con dence of a
shit-faced man.
“Maybe some other time,” Ruth
said gently.
“I can’t drink,” said Edward.
“When I drink, I get really vivid
nightmares. I have a glass of
whiskey, I fall asleep, and then
within twenty minutes I dream
somebody shot me in the face.”
But Albert had already forgotten
his own suggestion. His face was
buried in his hands. “God, my life
sucks,” he moaned. “I miss Louise.”
“Well,” Ruth o ered, “I don’t
know, maybe … maybe you could
try talking things over with her.”

Albert’s head snapped upward,
giving the illusion of sudden
sobriety. “That’s a good idea,” he
said. He staggered to his feet with
all the stability of a sailor on the
deck of a hurricane-stricken vessel.
“Wait, I didn’t mean right now,”
Ruth said, grabbing his elbow to
steady him.
Albert shook her o brusquely.
“No, right now. That’s the best time
ever,” he slurred.
He shu ed over to his horse,
taking a roundabout gure-eight
route. Curtis snorted but stood
calmly and patiently as Albert
made a valiant e ort to get

mounted. After three or four
attempts, he lost his balance and
thudded to the ground with one
foot still tangled in a stirrup.
“Listen, Al, why don’t you let us
take you home,” Edward said,
stepping toward his struggling
friend.
“No,” Albert answered
rmly.
“No, it’s okay, I just need a running
start.”
He ambled unevenly away from
Curtis, then turned around to face
the horse again. He steadied
himself and barreled forward once
more. He got his foot in the stirrup,
leapt up over Curtis’ back … and

slid right down the other side, once
again crashing into the dirt.
“Oh, God.” Edward
inched.
“Hey, Al, come on, you really
shouldn’t drink and horse.”
“IgotitIgotitIgotit,” Albert said.
And, true to his intention, he
nally managed to pull himself up
onto his horse’s back, where he lay
on his stomach, his arms and legs
dangling limply over the side.
“Okay,
go,”
he
commanded
listlessly, his boots spurring the
animal with scant vigor. Curtis,
however, knew his owner well
enough to take the cue and moved
o at a slow trot. Edward and Ruth

could hear the receding sound of
Albert’s snoring as he disappeared
into the night.
With a heavy heart and a heavy
liver,
Albert
ambled
toward
Louise’s modest white-trimmed
cottage.
He
forced
his
uncooperative limbs to dismount
from Curtis’s back and landed
unsteadily, though on his feet this
time. “Okay, I’ll be right back,
Curtis,” he slurred. “Or not, right?
No, no, that’s being too ambitious,”
he added, the liquor enabling him
to skillfully dodge every consonant
of the last word. He hugged Curtis’s

long equine nose with both arms.
“Y’know, Curtis, we don’t talk
enough. We should—let’s x that.
Let’s x that for sure. I love you,
Curtis. I love you so much.” Albert
rested his head a ectionately on
his friend’s furry muzzle …
… and woke up ve minutes
later in the same position, with a
dribble of vomit running from the
side of his mouth down toward
Curtis’s nostril. He straightened up
with a start and wiped o the puke
with his sleeve. “Oh, God, Curtis,
I’m so sorry! I’m so sorry! There we
go. All clean. Okay … here we go.”
Albert stumbled across the yard to

the front door and gave a loud
knock. He waited. There was no
answer. He knocked again, even
louder. After a moment, a light
came on somewhere in the back of
the house. He heard the padding of
approaching footsteps, and Louise
opened the door holding a lamp.
She blinked, rubbing the sleep out
of her eyes.
“Albert?”
Even unkempt and disheveled
with fatigue, she was perfect. The
errant strands of hair, the tangled
lashes, and the reddened cheek
where her head had been resting
on her pillow all only served to

accentuate her natural beauty.
“What the hell are you doing here?
It’s almost 1:30,” she rasped.
“Louise, we need to talk,” Albert
said, his consonants slippery as a
wet porch.
Louise sni ed the air. “Are you
drunk?” she asked.
“Oh. Yeah, well—a little. It’s
Curtis’s birthday, so we all took
him out, and … surprised him.”
“Look, I don’t know what you
want from me, but it’s late and I’m
going back to bed.” She started to
close the door, but Albert thrust out
an arm to stop her.
“Louise, I love you,” he said.

“And I know we can work this out.
I know it. Just—I can be cooler.
You’ll see.”
“Albert, no,” she said sternly. “I
already told you, it’s over. Now—”
“I’ll ght Charlie Blanche. I’ll do
it,” he interrupted.
“I don’t care about that,” she
sighed, losing patience.
“Can I come in?” he asked, his
body swaying with intoxication.
“I’m really drunk, so I’m not gonna
be able to get a boner, but I want
us to talk.”
“Albert, get out of here,” she shot
back brusquely. “I don’t have
anything else to say to you. Listen,

I’m sure you’re right for somebody
else, just not for me. Now, good
night.”
“Louise
…”
The
drunken
con dence in his expression fell
away, leaving in its wake a
p l e a d i n g look of desperation.
“What am I supposed to do without
you?”
She regarded him silently for all
of three seconds, then closed the
door firmly.
He stood by himself, feeling like
a wounded animal. “You heartless
fuckin’ jerk!” he shouted at the
closed door, then immediately
covered his bases with a heartfelt “I

still love you, though!” He knew
the importance of ending on a
positive note.
The old prospector looked as if
he’d been born a century ago.
Although he was barely sixty- ve,
the hardship of frontier life had put
its dusty, rocky foot up his ass over
and over, physically aging him far
beyond his actual years. His
grayish-white beard was scraggly
and ill-maintained, and his face
was cracked and reddened from
years of sun damage, with a side
order of alcohol abuse. He traveled
with two companions, each one

seemingly as old as he was. One
was his horse, a solitary old gray
who dutifully pulled the little
wagon with a comfortable laziness,
appearing to admire the landscape
as if out for a casual stroll with a
favorite gal. The other was a
mangy dog of no particular breed
that sat next to the old man,
panting and swaying back and
forth in rhythm with the movement
of the wagon. The dog had
unkempt oppy ears and a smelly
brown matting of fur, patchy and
uneven courtesy of innumerable
desert battles with fellow furred
adversaries.

The only thing that stood out
amidst this drab tableau was the
object that the prospector held in
his hand. It was no bigger than a
golf ball, but it screamed out its
presence
with
larger-than-life
luster. It was a real, honest-to-God
nugget, the rst one the prospector
had found in all his fty years of
scratching and pawing at the land.
He turned and gave the dog a
toothy, checkered grin. “You know
what I’m gonna buy you with this
gold, Plugger? I’m gonna buy you a
big ol’ pile of fresh-cut steak.”
Plugger panted happily as the
old man scratched his shaggy ears.

“And I’m gonna get you a whole
mess of bones fulla marrow. You
like that?”
Plugger licked the prospector’s
liver-spotted hand.
The old man let loose a gravelly,
bellowing laugh.
Plugger
barked
loudly
in
response.
The man patted the dog’s mangy
back. “Okay, okay, that’s enough
now,” he said with a smile.
But Plugger’s barking did not
stop. Suddenly it became more
intense.
“Hey, hey, settle down there,
boy, whatsa matter?”

And then, as if in reply to the
inquiry, the sound of approaching
hoofbeats.
The prospector squinted against
the bright sun. The road ahead
looked empty, but the dust cloud
ascending from beyond the next
rise told a different story.
Riders. From the look of the dust,
five or more.
His hands shaking due to both
nerves and age, the old man
hurriedly stu ed his glittering prize
into his pocket. As he turned his
attention back to the road ahead, a
group of six men came galloping
over the rise. The old gray shifted

his weight with uneasiness, and
Plugger continued his lengthy
oration. As the riders approached
and slowed to a stop, the old man
could see that it was not six men
after all. It was ve men and a
woman.
A rough-looking bunch too.
The lead rider was as hardlooking a man as the prospector
had ever seen. The lines on his face
betrayed a lifetime of anger, and
the folds of his skin dove deep into
those weathered grooves.
But his eyes.
Even from a moderate distance,
it was evident. Those eyes were

deadly. They spoke of a long-rotted
soul,
to
which mercy
and
compassion had no value and
never would. They were more
reptilian than human, as coldblooded as any creature that had
ever lurked in the pocked depths of
the Arizona desert. This was a man
to be feared.
The girl was more of a puzzle. As
the prospector slowed his wagon to
a halt, he glanced in her direction.
She was quite beautiful. Probably
mid-thirties, the old man guessed.
She had a kind face, even though
her stony expression was doing its
best to deny the fact. Her soft-

looking brown hair and graceful
curves were out of place among the
company she kept. She didn’t
belong with this group—and yet
somehow she did.
Plugger’s barking interrupted the
old
man’s
thoughts.
“Easy,
Plugger,” he said. He tipped his
battered hat toward the riders.
“Howdy, there,” he o ered, his
tone bright with a cheerful
nonchalance he did not feel.
The lead rider spoke with a voice
as calm as still water. “We’d be
obliged if you could point us
toward the Sherman Creek Trail.”
The prospector exhaled a bit.

Maybe he’d overreacted. These
men were just passing through. A
small band of honest cowboys
heading out to Sherman Creek.
Probably looking for work. Good
for them. Decent work was hard to
nd, and if they were willing to
ride that far out to make an honest
day’s wages, well, then, he’d be
happy to point them in the right
direction.
“Well, sure, I can help you
there,” he said.
He reached into the back of the
wagon and retrieved a tattered
map. He ignored the screaming
protestations of his old bones as he

pulled himself down o the seat
and made his way over to the lead
rider. With a crooked nger he
indicated a snaky black line
running through the center of the
map. “You’re on the main road
now, see? The main road goes all
the way through Bullhead and then
runs right into Sherman Creek
Trail. But if you ask me, I’d say
you’d probably get there quicker if
you take Bilbee Pass. You’d be
safer too. Less chance of bandits
and such.”
“Bandits?” The rider looked
curious. “Are there bandits in these
parts?”

“Well, I only come upon ’em a
few times in my years, but you
never can rightly say. Bilbee Pass is
your best bet. Get you there faster
too.”
A smile spread across the rider’s
face as he stared down at the old
man. But there was no warmth in it
at all. In fact, to the prospector it
looked less like a smile and more
like a wound sliced open by the
blade of an invisible swordsman.
“Thank you,” the rider said, his
gaze deadlocked with the milky,
weary eyes of the prospector.
The old man stared back for a
moment, then began backing away

toward his wagon. “Oh, no
trouble,” he said, with a quaver in
his voice. “Happy to help out a
friendly stranger.” The prospector
prepared to pull himself up onto
his wagon, when the rider spoke
again.
“Oh, there’s one more thing you
can do for us.”
The old man froze. It was a
simple statement, presented calmly
and
courteously,
nothing
threatening in it at all. And yet the
prospector was suddenly terri ed
for his life. He tried to keep the
fear out of his voice as he
answered. “What’s that?”

“You can hand over the gold.”
All pretense of civility had
vanished
from
the
rider’s
demeanor. The outer skin had been
shed, and the reptile was poised.
But for what?
The
prospector
somehow
managed to keep his wits about
him and responded with deliberate
conversational
passivity.
“Oh,
I … I ain’t got no gold. I wish.
Been prospectin’ all day, and that
stream’s panned out. On my way
back to town now.”
“You see, that’s just it,” said the
rider. “You’re heading back to
town in the middle of the day.

Prospector only does that when
he’s found gold to sell. Now give it
to me.”
“I swear, I don’t have any gold.
I’m headin’ into town early, cause
—”
The rider drew his gun and
pointed it directly at the old man’s
head.
The
prospector
no
longer
troubled himself to hide his terror.
He could feel a warm wetness
sp rea ding around his groin. He
reached into his pocket for the
nugget. “Oh, now, wait a minute.
Y’know, I might have a little bit of
gold—”

The rider shot him in the head.
The old prospector staggered
back and slumped to the ground,
dead.
Plugger barked wildly, then
bounded over and sni ed at his
master’s body with confusion.
The woman spoke for the rst
time, whirling angrily to face the
lead rider.
“Clinch, goddammit, you didn’t
have to do that!”
Clinch turned and ashed his
open-wound smile. “I know I didn’t
have to, sweetheart.”
“He would’ve given you the
gold!”

“The point is, I had to ask him
twice. I’m a busy man with a
schedule.”
Her eyes narrowed with clear
hatred. “You’re a son of a bitch is
what you are.”
His smile vanished, and in the
same instant his arm lashed out
like a whip, striking her across the
face with full force. She tumbled off
her horse and landed hard in the
dirt. Yet somehow, even as she
wiped a trickle of blood from her
lower lip, she managed to appear
unscathed.
“Don’t you ever talk to me like
that again,” Clinch commanded

with a deadly tone. “A man’s wife
will show him respect. Now, let me
hear you try it again.”
The woman got to her feet and
batted her lashes mockingly. “Oh,
honey, you’re the best, I’m so
happy to be with you, oh, my God,
I love you, I’m, like, the luckiest
girl ever in the history of girls.”
Before Clinch could strike her
again, one of the other outlaws
approached
with
the
fallen
prospector’s map. “Clinch, the old
man was right. We’d lose half a
day goin’ through Bullhead.”
Clinch brie y studied the routes.
He then folded the map and

addressed the group of outlaws.
“All right. Ben, you, Enoch, and
Jordy’ll ride with me. We’ll follow
Bilbee Pass to Sherman Creek Trail.
And make no mistake about the
kinda heat we’re gonna draw after
we take that stage. Every lawman
in this territory’ll be out for us.” He
turned to his wife, who had
mounted her horse again. “And you
—you’re staying outta harm’s
way.” He indicated the weaselfaced, badly scarred man mounted
next to him. “Lewis, you’ll ride east
with Anna and hole up in this town
right here.” He pointed to the map.
“Old Stump. We’ll let things cool

down, and we’ll come for you in
three weeks.”
Anna gave Clinch a loveless
smile. “Thank you so much,
sweetheart, for always thinking
about my safety.”
He reciprocated with an even
icier smile, kicked his mount, and
was o . Within moments, the rest
o f the group was gone, and Anna
remained alone save for ugly, ratfaced Lewis, a mangy dog, a tired
gray horse, and the corpse of an
innocent old man who had done
nothing to deserve his fate.
Lewis glanced at the map and
turned his horse east. “C’mon,

Anna, let’s go.”
She began to follow him, then
suddenly halted. She called out to
the dog. “Plugger! Plugger, c’mon,
boy!”
The dog looked up, seemingly
unsure.
“C’mon, Plugger! C’mon!”
At last, thanks to the canine gift
of short-term memory, Plugger
came bounding after her.
They headed for Old Stump.
The days and nights rolled by,
each one dissolving into the next, a
chronological blur. Albert never
left the house save to tend his

sheep, and the tiny home’s supplies
and stores were beginning to run
low. His mother and father clucked
and barked at him to make a trip
into town for replenishments, but
he barely heard them. Their voices
seemed to be echoing down from
the rim of a deep well at the
bottom of which he huddled. The
rational part of his brain knew that
the constant cutting pain of a
breakup was only a temporary
thing, that it would get a little bit
easier each day, each week, each
month, until one day he’d wake up
and nd himself utterly ba ed
that he had ever let this bygone

woman cripple him so completely.
But that part of his brain wasn’t
in charge at the moment. For now
he was a creature of emotion, and
the su ering distorted his thinking.
He lay on his bed staring up at the
wooden beams on the ceiling. I
can’t live without her. No one has
ever loved anyone as much as I love
her. And there’s no one else who will
ever make me as happy as she does.
The early-afternoon sun was now
lashing him across the face as it
sliced through the edge of the
burlap covering that hung from his
window. Albert groaned in protest
and turned over on his side, but he

knew sleep would continue to
elude him. He hadn’t slept all
night, and he was exhausted, but
his body refused to submit to
unconsciousness.
He rose sluggishly and padded
into the main room. His pajamas
stank from days of wear, but
changing clothes had become a
weekly activity, not a daily one.
His mother and father sat in their
usual spots, engaged in their usual
activities: Elsie sewing, George
reading the Bible.
“Well, look who’s up at two in
the afternoon,” George said.
Albert stopped and stared down

at him. “You ever think about
reading another book, Dad? I
mean, at this point, don’t you
pretty much know how that one
ends?”
“I nd new meaning in this book
every day,” he snapped back. “Eat
something. There’s still some sweet
cream and pig ass on the table if
you want it.”
Albert glared at the unappetizing
spread. “No, thanks.”
“Well, you want something else?
Make a run into town. This is all
we got left.”
Albert ignored his father and
shu ed toward the front door to

make an outhouse trip. When he
opened the squeaky, whining door,
he was startled to nd Edward,
mid-knock. He almost rapped
Albert in the nose.
“Oh, sorry, Al.”
“Edward. Hey.” Albert blinked
like a mole in the bright sunlight.
“My God, you look terrible.”
Edward frowned.
“Ahhh, there’s that con dence
boost I need. How you doin’,
buddy?”
“Can I come in?” asked Edward.
“Sure, sure,” Albert answered
with a dead expression. “I know
my parents are gonna be totally

thrilled to see you. Guys, Edward’s
here!”
George
and
Elsie
nodded
wordlessly.
“Look at them.” Albert smiled
without amusement. “They just
love company. We all do. You
want some pig ass?”
Edward shifted uncomfortably
and stepped inside. “Albert, I’m
really worried about you. I haven’t
seen you in town for a week and a
half. All you do is stay home and
sleep.”
“Well, I went out last Tuesday to
pay o
Charlie Blanche so he
wouldn’t shoot me in the face.”

“That’s not what I mean.”
“Look, Edward, I feel like I need
to be here with my parents,” Albert
said, his voice dripping with the
thick syrup of sarcasm. “They’re
not gonna be around much longer,
and I wanna give back all that love
and a ection I got growing up.
Right, Dad?”
George broke wind.
“Look,” said Edward, trying to
get the conversation back on track,
“I know you’re taking this breakup
hard, and I understand … but I
think you’ve got to get out of your
funk. I mean, Jesus, you haven’t
even shorn your sheep in weeks.”

“I have too,” Albert shot back
petulantly.
“Albert, there’s a sheep out there
that looks like a giant ball of
cotton with legs. You can’t even
see its head—there’s only a nose
sticking out. I just saw it walk into
a wall. C’mon, why don’t you come
into town with me, huh? We’ll get
a late lunch.”
“Well, y’know, thank you for
your concern, Edward, but if I
leave the house and go into town, I
might see her, and then I’m gonna
get even more depressed.”
“Well, of course you’re gonna see
her, she’s in town all the time,”

Edward said.
Albert’s head snapped upward,
and he suddenly looked alert for
the first time in weeks. He began to
speak much more rapidly. “Why,
did you see her? How is she? Is she
sad? Did she look sad? Has she lost
a lot of weight? Did she gain
weight? Is she fat now? That would
help.”
“Yeah, I saw her; she seems
ne,” Edward answered patiently.
“Which is all the more reason for
you to get back out there! Show her
you’re
ne too! I mean, things
could be worse—”
“I’m not ne,” Albert interrupted.

“And I don’t mean to sound like a
jerk, but you don’t know what
you’re talking about, okay? You
have no idea what it’s like. You’re
going home every night and having
sex with your girlfriend.”
“No, Ruth and I haven’t had sex,”
Edward said matter-of-factly.
Albert stared at him for a beat,
uncertain whether he’d heard
correctly. “You … you’ve never had
sex with Ruth?”
“No.”
“You’ve been seeing each other
for a long time, though.”
“Six years. Yikes. Wow. Doesn’t
seem like it.”

“Doesn’t she … have sex with
like ten guys every day at the
whorehouse?”
“On a slow day, yeah.”
Albert paused again. “But … you
guys have never had sex.”
“No.” Edward shook his head.
“Ruth says not until we’re married.
She’s a Christian, and so am I, and
we want to save ourselves for each
other. Y’know, for our wedding
night.”
Albert allowed himself to process
this information. And then he
patted his friend on the shoulder.
“You’re right, Edward. Things could
be a lot worse. I’ll try to meet some

people.”
Albert stared at the jar of
licorice. He remembered coming
into the Old Stump General Store
as a young boy and gazing with
desire at the small but intoxicating
array of three or four varieties of
confections displayed on the
countertop. He would ask his father
for a peppermint stick or a piece of
chocolate, desperately appealing to
a paternally generous nature that
never revealed itself. Instead, his
father would say, “If you do ten
hours’ worth of extra chores each
week for the next month, I’ll buy

you a peppermint stick.” Albert
would nod vigorously and throw
himself into the task for four or
ve days, at which point he would
inevitably decide he was getting
played for a jackass. No single
piece of candy was worth that
much e ort. So he’d give up on the
whole exercise and resign himself
to longing gazes. His only
salvation came once a year or so,
when Mr. Crawford, the nowdeceased owner of the store, would
take pity and o er Albert a licorice
stick. The taste was euphorically
sweet, but it almost made the
whole ordeal worse, because it

showed him what he was missing.
Now, in the prime of adulthood,
the candy tortured him in a
di erent way. He had enough of
his own money to buy a piece of
peppermint or chocolate, but the
desire was gone. What an ironic
waste. Just another way 1882 sucks
the meat. He settled for a piece of
chewing gum.
He was about to walk out with
his groceries when he noticed a
very pretty girl standing by the
cookware, examining a pot. Had he
been clearheaded and unfettered
by the pain of a broken heart, he
would probably have felt the

stirrings of arousal, but Louise’s
power had snu ed out any
possibility of that. Still, on a
rational level, he was able to
acknowledge her good looks. She
had dark hair, awless skin, and
pretty brown eyes. It occurred to
him that this was a perfect
opportunity to take proactive
control of his stagnant condition
and begin the task of moving on
from Louise—much as that thought
made him sick to his stomach.
Albert popped the chewing gum
into his mouth, put on his coolest
expression, took a deep breath, and
walked over to the girl.

“Hi,” he said.
She looked up momentarily,
smiled with a polite “hello,” then
went back to inspecting her pot.
“I, uh … notice you’re looking at
pots,” he said.
“Yeah, I am,” she said, once
again giving him the polite smile.
“Store’s pretty great, huh?” He
smiled back. “There’s gotta be like
twelve di erent items in here. I
mean, how do you pick, right? It’s
like
sensory
overload.”
His
humorous, sarcastic observation
would surely get a giggle out of
her.
“Yeah,” she answered, o ering

up a less enthusiastic variant of her
smile.
“Ran that eight-item store outta
business. Right? That was pretty
sad.”
Now the girl did not respond at
all. Her full attention was on the
cookware.
Albert shifted his approach. “You
ever tried gum?” he asked,
deliberately increasing the volume
of his chewing.
“No,” she said, her eyes now
fixed on a set of plates.
“It’s this new thing, pretty cool.”
Albert smiled with faux con dence.
“Just came out, been makin’ its

way around the country. It’s like
candy, but you don’t have to
swallow.”
The girl put the plates back
down on the shelf and granted
Albert a last perfunctory look of
acknowledgment. “Well, have a
good rest of your day,” she said,
turning to the selection of fabrics
farther down the shelf. Albert
pretended to be very interested in
a sack of henhouse feed for a
moment, then moved to follow. He
had one arrow left in his quiver.
“Hey, listen,” he said. “I don’t
know if you’re doing anything next
Sunday after church, but they’re

gonna be delivering a big block of
ice into town and … should be
pretty cool to watch. You don’t
usually get a chance to see that
much ice all together in one place.”
“That doesn’t interest me,” she
said.
“Yeah, no, me either; it’s gonna
be stupid,” he responded, jumping
ship on the idea.
Then all of a sudden she turned
and looked directly at him, giving
him her full attention. His courage
swelled momentarily, until: “I just
gured out where I’ve seen you,”
she said. “Aren’t you the guy that
backed out of that gunfight?”

“Uh, yeah … You were there?”
“Pretty much the whole town
was there.”
“Whole town, yeah. Guess I’m a
pretty popular guy.”
“No, not after that.”
Knowing
he’d
blown
this
encounter and feeling defensive,
Albert reverted to grade-school
mode.
“Oh,
yeah,
like you’re so
popular,” he said.
“Actually, I was voted prom
queen,” she responded.
“Well, okay, but … how many
people were in your class? Like
three?”

“Six.”
“Oh, actually, that’s a lot,” he
admitted.
Albert spun on his heel and
walked out, feeling like shit all
over again.
And so it was for the next several
days. No one could have accused
Albert of not trying to get back on
his feet in the dating department,
but between the scant o erings
available in Old Stump and Albert’s
own romantic ineptitude, he found
himself doomed to letdown after
letdown.
There was young Betty Alden,

the saloonkeeper’s daughter, who
could outdrink any man and who
ended up vomiting in Albert’s lap
as they sat on the front porch of
her home, looking at the stars.
There was Georgia Behan, an
attractive-enough young seamstress
who, however, had a super uous
incisor growing from her left
nostril, which made kissing her a
painful and sometimes injurious
experience. And there was Yao
Ling, the lovely Chinese girl Albert
had met on the road on his way
back from Edward’s Shoe Repair,
whom he had subsequently asked
out to dinner. They met at Clara’s

Restaurant, Old Stump’s one and
only dining establishment, and it
didn’t take long for the evening to
go sour.
“So, tell me about your family,”
Albert asked her as they were
waiting to order. “What do your
parents do?”
“Are you … are you serious?” she
responded blankly.
“Well, yeah,” Albert said.
“My dad owns a business that
manufactures brass light xtures
for upscale hotels.”
Albert was impressed. “Wow,
really?”
Her expression instantly turned

contemptuous. “No, he’s a fucking
railroad builder, like every other
Chinaman out here.”
Albert laughed nervously. “Oh.
Ha. That other thing was so
speci c, I thought—well, I bet he’s
a … really neat guy, though,” he
offered lamely.
“Gosh, I wouldn’t know, I never
see him,” she shot back with
bitterness. “You know how many
hours he works?”
“Um … all the live-long day?”
Yao Ling was on her feet and
heading out the door within
seconds.
“Wait—come on!” Albert shouted

desperately. “Are you … even
allowed to be o ended by anything
I do?”
But of all his botched attempts at
moving on from Louise, perhaps
the most uncomfortable was the
blind date. One of the neighboring
dirt farmers just across the range
had said he had a daughter who
was still unmarried and o ered to
set her up with Albert. Grateful for
the thought, Albert accepted and
suggested a lunch meeting at
Clara’s. When he arrived, he found
himself seated across the table from
a twelve-year-old girl.
Marriage at a young age was, of

course, not uncommon, but Albert
wasn’t the type to go in for such an
arrangement. It would be di cult
to maintain a satisfying, mature
relationship with a woman if you
were constantly being asked to
help with her homework. He tried
to let her down easily.
“So, I uh … I know this sort of
thing is totally acceptable out here
on the frontier, but, uh … not
gonna lie, something about it feels
kinda weird.”
“My mother says I need to nd a
husband so I don’t become an old
maid,” the girl said, shifting in her
seat.

“Well, I … I think you got a few
years ahead of you before that.
How—how old are you?” asked
Albert.
“I’ll be twelve in this many
days,” she answered, proudly
holding up eight fingers.
The waiter approached with his
order pad. “Would you and your
girlfriend like some dessert?” he
asked.
“Oh, she’s not my girlfriend,”
Albert answered a little too loudly.
“Um, we’ll just take the check.” The
waiter smiled and walked away.
“Why were you such a dick about
that?” The girl scowled.

“What?”
“ ‘She’s not my girlfriend,’ ” she
mocked. “You were so aggressive
about it. What, do I embarrass you
or something?”
“No, no, but I …” Albert
searched. “I mean, this is a rst
date, so I think terms like girlfriend
are a little premature. I just want
to keep this open, y’know?”
“Oh, well, I’m sorry you’re
feeling smothered,” she said, xing
him with a cold stare.
Albert gnawed a chunk of bread.
“Y’know, I’m starting to see why
you don’t have a husband.”

The funeral was a modest a air,
though certainly average by the
standards of the community. It was
a perfect day for it too, with the
dull slate sky overhead and the
chilly breeze ghosting its way
across the plains. Albert and his
father stood around the open
grave, anked by Edward, Ruth,
and several other townsfolk. Pastor
Wilson led the ceremony, reading
solemnly
from
scripture.
“O
merciful God, take this good
woman
into
thine
heavenly
kingdom, that she may nd peace
and
freedom
from
earthly
su ering,” he intoned with as much

life as the corpse itself.
Albert always wondered how he
would feel when he lost a parent.
He had assumed that George would
be the rst one to go, but it had
turned out to be Elsie. And
although she’d been in her
seventies, it wasn’t old age that
took her. Elsie had gone outside to
fetch water from the well, when a
cougar attacked. The only silver
lining was that the cat’s initial
pounce had knocked her down with
such force that her skull cracked
open as it slammed into a rock.
Thus she was already dead when
the cougar began feasting on her

innards. George had rushed outside
when he heard the ruckus and
managed to scare the animal o
with a few rounds from his
Winchester, but it was too late.
And so he and Albert now stood
side by side, father and son, their
heads bowed low as they said their
silent goodbyes to Elsie Stark, wife
and mother. But although Albert
felt all the pain associated with
such a loss, what he felt the most
was shame and confusion. I’m more
broken up over Louise than I am over
the loss of my mother. How the hell
could that be? Was he so awash in
self-pity and so twisted in his

perspective that he’d become
utterly callous to the outside
world? Was he a terrible person?
Or was it merely that Elsie been
such a hardheaded pain-in-the-ass
bitch when she was alive?
His torturous self-analysis was
cut short by an empathetic hand on
his shoulder.
“I’m
really
sorry,
Albert,”
Edward whispered sadly.
Albert turned and o ered him a
polite smile of gratitude. He then
turned to his father. “You okay,
Dad?”
George’s face was a stony-eyed
mask. “She was a good solid

woman,” he grunted. “I liked her.”
“Easy, Dad, I’m uncomfortable
with all this emotion.”
Two cowboys approached, each
one carrying a dead body slung
over his shoulder. The corpses were
covered in fresh blood from
multiple bullet wounds. “Hey, we
got a couple more here,” said the
first cowboy.
“Yeah, can we get in on this
grave?” said the second.
Albert sighed. “Yeah, sure.”
Resources were scarce on the
frontier, so everyone shared what
they had with the community
whenever
possible.
The
two

cowboys tossed the bodies into the
grave on top of Elsie, tipped their
hats in appreciation, and ambled
off.
Albert and Edward took their
time as they strolled down the
thoroughfare. They were early for
church, and it was an unusually
cool 92 degrees. Edward pulled out
his handkerchief and dabbed at the
beads of sweat on his forehead. His
chunky physique didn’t serve him
particularly well in such a hot
climate, but Albert had never heard
him complain. How the hell does he
do it? He manages to nd happiness

in even the shittiest places.
A young boy raced past them,
deftly using a stick to guide a
rolling metal hoop down the street.
“I see kids everywhere with those
stick
hoops
lately,”
Albert
observed.
“It’s gotta be bad for their brains,
right?” said Edward.
“ I t has to be. Stunts their
attention spans. There was an
article in the paper.”
“I read that. It said it’s making
them unable to focus on more longterm, thought-intensive tasks.”
“Exactly, it’s the death of
innovation. I’m telling you, when

intellectual progress comes to a
screeching halt twenty years from
now, you can thank the stick
hoop.”
Suddenly Albert stopped dead in
his tracks.
Halfway up the street stood the
moustachery. It was a salon of
sorts where a gentleman could go
for a trim or a styling of his
moustache. Moustaches were a sign
of status and power, and the
bigger, the bushier, the curlier a
man’s moustache, the more he was
to be respected. But what
paralyzed Albert was the sight of
the two individuals emerging from

the building. One of them was Foy
Ellison, the well-groomed, welldressed owner of the establishment.
And the other was Louise. With
her arm in his.
“Ho. Ly. Shit,” Albert cursed in
shocked disbelief.
She had lied to him. Lied right to
his face. Whether it had been in the
interest of protecting his feelings or
simply to avoid confrontation, he
did
not
know.
But
the
unpasteurized reality chewed his
guts apart instantly. He hadn’t
thought anything could be worse
than Louise leaving him, but
obviously there was one thing:

Louise giving herself to another
man.
“Oh, God …” Edward shifted
uncomfortably as he regarded his
friend with obvious sympathy.
“She told me she didn’t want to
date anyone!” Albert sputtered.
“She said she had to work on herself!
Bull-fucking shit! And Foy! The
owner of the moustachery! What.
The. Fuck. If it were acceptable to
be openly gay, Foy would have ten
Englishmen living in his asshole.”
“Maybe you should grow a
moustache,” Edward suggested.
“I can’t a ord it,” Albert said
with dismay. “The upkeep alone:

the waxes, the oils, the creams. I
don’t have the cash. My God.
Fucking Foy.” Suddenly he had to
be anywhere but here. “Come on,
let’s go. Where’s Ruth? She coming
to church?”
“No, she has a ten o’clock
blumpkin,”
Edward
answered
matter-of-factly.
Albert stared at him, confused.
“What’s a blumpkin?”
“It’s when a man receives fellatio
while he’s making stool. They just
invented it in Italy, and it’s become
popular here.” Edward smiled with
pride in his awareness of world
affairs.

“ ‘Receives fellatio’? You make it
sound like a Communion service,”
Albert said.
“Well, it’s just the process.”
“So, a guy gets his dick sucked
while he’s taking a shit.”
“Albert, don’t use those words,”
Edward said with indignation. “It
diminishes Ruth’s work. She takes a
lot of pride in doing a good job.”
“I’m … I’m sorry, Edward. I
wasn’t thinking. It won’t happen
again.”
“It’s okay.” Edward’s moonfaced
smile reappeared, his nature easily
forgiving as always. He brightened
still further as he pointed past

Albert’s shoulder. “Hey, look! It’s
the ice!”
Albert turned. Sure enough,
seven men were laboring to
complete the arduous task of
unloading a massive block of ice
from the back of a wagon. The
block had endured a long journey
prior to its arrival on the frontier.
The Tudor Ice Company of Boston,
Massachusetts, would cut large
blocks of ice from frozen lakes and
ponds during winter in New
England and then ship them across
the country, where they could be
sold to communities whose climates
made it impossible to otherwise

acquire ice, particularly during the
summer months. It was an
impressive sight indeed to watch
these men struggle with a block
that was nearly the size of the
wagon that held it. Three of them
handled the rope-and-pulley system
that hoisted the ice o the cart,
while the other four guided it down
toward the open icehouse doors,
where it would be prepped for
further cutting. Albert watched
with fascination, allowing himself
a tiny satis ed smile as he recalled
the girl in the general store who
had rebu ed him. “See, this is fun.
She missed out.”

A rope snapped. The ice fell and
crushed the skull of one of the men.
Thick red brain pasta spilled out
into the street.
Albert and Edward screamed in
horror and hurried to church.
“And make no mistake, my
children,” Pastor Wilson droned on
in his customarily tranquilizing
tone, “there shall be swift and
righteous justice on all free-grazers.
No more shall they nibble
wantonly at the teat of our co ers.
And that’s just exactly like that
part in the Bible that applies to
that situation. Amen.”

“Amen,”
echoed
the
congregation.
For the fth time during that
morning’s service, Albert glanced
over
his
shoulder
as
inconspicuously as he could. Louise
sat on the other side of the aisle, a
few rows back. Foy sat beside her.
He was a classically handsome
dandy, with well-oiled hair and a
big cocky asshole moustache
stretching out so widely on either
side that it was almost like his face
had two hairy arms extended in a
ta-da
gesture. Ta-da! A colossal
prick!
As if hearing the thought, Foy

glanced in Albert’s direction. Albert
quickly averted his gaze to the
pulpit.
The pastor continued. “We would
like to o er a heartfelt prayer for
the family of James Addison, who
was killed this morning while
unloading the ice shipment. James,
we’ll think of you lovingly this July
as we sip the cold summer
beverages for which you gave your
life.”
Albert leaned over to Edward,
whispering in disbelief, “They’re
still gonna use the fuckin’ ice.”
“Before we end the service this
morning,” Pastor Wilson went on,

“we’d like to welcome two new
members of our community: Lewis
Barnes and his sister, Anna.
They’ve just moved here to Old
Stump, and they plan to build a
farm, so we wish them the best of
luck. That concludes today’s
service. God bless you for another
week, and there is a mountain lion
warning in effect.”
As the congregation began to
disperse, Albert curiously observed
the new arrivals. They were an odd
pair, these two siblings. The man,
Lewis, looked as if God had lost a
bet. His face was rough and
pockmarked, his skin appearing

less like esh and more like the
surface of a badly maintained dirt
road peppered with horseshit. He
was not a small man by any
means, but his weaselly, rodentlike face looked as if it belonged on
a skinnier, more frail body. Albert
hoped for the fellow’s sake that he
was either really smart or had a
winning sense of humor. From the
looks of him, neither was the case.
The woman was intriguing. How
she could possibly be related to this
guy was a mystery. She was
certainly
beautiful
by
any
standard, and her face radiated a
relaxed, tranquil quality that

seemed too august for the hard
world of the frontier. Yet as high
above her dusty surroundings as
she carried herself, she somehow
did not seem uncomfortable with
the disunion. Regardless, she would
surely be over this crap town and
on her way in a very short time.
The moustachery was perhaps
the
most
well-appointed
establishment in Old Stump. There
w e r e various photographs of
distinguished-looking
gentlemen
lining the walls, each one sporting
a more extravagant, amboyant
moustache than the last. There

were big bushy moustaches that
blocked out the lower half of the
face save for the tip of the chin,
thickly
waxed
and
oiled
moustaches ending in sharp spirals
at either end, and moustaches that
gracefully
melted
into
fat
muttonchop
sideburns.
This
Tuesday afternoon, there were a
few patrons scattered about the
place. One sat comfortably in the
grooming
chair,
getting
a
moustache trim; another examined
an array of waxes, oils, and
creams; a third was engaged in
conversation with Foy himself.
“I would say you could try oiling

it into a ne curl,” Foy suggested,
rubbing his thumb and fore nger
together for emphasis. “Your
moustache de nitely has the body
for it.”
“Yeah, I’ve thought about that,
but I sorta like it a little messy,
y’know? Sorta fun?” the customer
answered with a conflicted tone.
“Well, if that’s what you’re going
for, I’d use the cream, and I would
definitely let it grow.”
“See, I kinda wanna do that.”
“And, you know what, I see the
hesitation on your face, but, trust
me, you could do that.”
“Like shoulder length?”

“Do it. You’ll thank me.”
“See, I’ve always wanted to do
shoulder length, but I’m worried I
don’t have the chin for it.”
“You have the chin for it,” Foy
assured him.
“Okay, wow, you just gave me,
like, a whole bunch of confidence.”
“Try the cream for a few weeks,
and let me know how it goes.”
“I will, thank you. I’m excited
now! I want it to grow really fast!”
The man hurried out the door.
As it swung back, Louise
gracefully
sauntered
in,
all
bouncing
blond
curls
and
coquettish smiles for her wealthy

new boyfriend. “Hi!” She beamed,
throwing her arms around him.
“Hey, you.” Foy grinned. He
grabbed her by the waist and
kissed her long and hard. She
reciprocated momentarily, then
pulled away as she swung her hips
back and forth, ashing her most
seductively girlish smile.
“So, the fair’s coming up soon,
and I thought maybe we could go
dress shopping later,” she said,
batting her long lashes.
Foy took the cue. “You know, I
was thinking you could use a new
dress.”
“Something … expensive?” she

said, sliding a slender white nger
down the center of his chest.
“Stupidly expensive,” he said, his
tone theatrically devilish.
She laughed gaily and reached a
hand around the back of his neck,
pulling him in for another kiss.
Albert was just in time to get an
eyeful as he walked through the
door. Yes, he’d had time to process
the breakup. Sure, he’d tried to
move forward by seeing other
people. Yes, he’d known Louise
and Foy were together. But the
actual sight of her kissing him was
a knife in his side. And suddenly all
the agony came surging back in a

nauseating wave, and he hurt all
over again just as much as the day
he’d lost her. But he’d be damned if
he’d let it show.
Foy saw him rst, and quietly
pulled his lips away from his new
girlfriend’s.
Louise turned to look and
immediately lowered her gaze with
an embarrassed sigh. “Oh, Jesus,”
she muttered under her breath.
“Hi, Albert,” Foy greeted him
confidently.
“Hello,” Albert answered, warily
stepping inside. He pretended to be
disinterested as he surveyed the
various moustache-related products

lining the shelves.
“What’s up, kiddo?” said Foy.
“Never seen you in here before.”
“Just, um … browsing.” Albert
hoped his faux nonchalance was at
least somewhat convincing.
“Yeah … you don’t have a
moustache, though.”
“Well, I was … I was thinkin’
about growin’ one.”
Louise whispered to Foy, loud
enough for Albert to hear, “I’m
gonna use the powder room.” She
whirled with spinning skirts and
retreated through a door in the
back.
Albert felt another stab of

distress. He’d shared so much love
with this girl, so many good times,
so many memories … and now she
couldn’t even bear to be in the
same room with him. Again, he
managed to conceal his piercing
heartache and kept his attention on
Foy.
“What kinda moustache you
looking to grow?” Foy asked,
taking a couple of steps toward
Albert.
“Um … a big one.” Albert
suddenly had no clue at all why
he’d even set foot in this place or
what he’d hoped to accomplish.
“The kind that … goes down below

my mouth, and then along the edge
of my jaw … and then, um … goes
up and becomes my sideburns, and
then becomes my hair.”
“A Möbius moustache,” said Foy
without missing a beat.
“A Möbius moustache, yeah,”
Albert responded, acting as if it
had been on the tip of his tongue
the whole time.
As if sensing Albert was in over
his head, Foy doubled the
condescension in his tone. “You
know, that sort of moustache is a
costly facial accessory.”
“Yeah,” said Albert with false
assuredness.

“Well … you’re a sheep farmer.”
Foy grinned a grin that made
Albert wish cholera upon him.
Fuck it. “You feel good about
what you’re doing?” Albert said,
taking a step closer to the
moustachier.
Foy appeared unbothered. “What
am I doing?”
“Stealing a guy’s girlfriend?”
Albert could feel his face getting
red
with
both
fury
and
embarrassment. “You able to sleep
at night?”
“Hey, Louise dumped you, my
friend. It’s not my fault she wanted
someone with more to o er. I can

give her a lavish home. Warm
blankets. Wrapped candies. Can
you say the same, Albert? Can you
give Louise wrapped candies?”
Albert locked gazes with him for
a moment. “Fuck you, man,” he
blurted, knowing he’d lost this
round and feeling dumb as a mule.
“Yeah, that’s what she’s doing,”
Foy shot back, nishing the match.
Albert
stormed out
of
the
moustachery in defeat, resolving
never to return. Not to this
establishment, and not to Old
Stump. It was time to go.
That

evening

Edward

sat

patiently at a corner table in the
Old Stump saloon, nursing a beer.
He really wasn’t much of a drinker.
Drinking, he supposed, was for the
unhappy. For those who wished to
block out the misery of their lives.
Edward felt no such dissatisfaction.
He derived great pleasure from his
work as a cobbler, he adored his
little apartment just above the
workshop, and, most of all, he was
over the moon with happiness in
his blissful relationship with Ruth.
He smiled to himself, knowing that
in just a few minutes she’d be
nished having sex with the
pastor’s son upstairs in the brothel,

and then she’d come bounding
down those steps with a big kiss for
her devoted boyfriend. He wanted
to be sure he was church-sober for
that sweet confection.
As Edward took another baby sip
from his mug, he observed Old
Stump’s two newcomers entering
through the batwing doors and
making their way over to the bar.
Anna and Lewis Barnes, they were
called. New faces were always
welcome as far as Edward was
concerned, the continued growth of
the town being of great value and
importance to everyone.
At last, Ruth came hurrying

down the stairs and made her way
over to Edward’s table. She looked
disheveled and unkempt, but
Edward saw none of it. He saw
only what he always saw: the most
beautiful woman in the world, and
the purest, most magni cent
representation of true love that
any man could ever hope for. He
kissed her eagerly as she sat down.
“Hi, honey!” he said with a warm
smile.
“Oh, gosh, that was a long day.”
She sighed, sinking into the chair
and helping herself to a generous
draught of his beer.
“Aw, what happened?”

“This guy wanted me to smoke a
cigar and ash on his balls while I
jerked him off.”
“Really? Wow, see, your job is
interesting ’cause no two days are
alike,” he said with envy. “I go to
work
and
I’m,
like,
grrr!
Monotony!”
“Yeah, I guess it’d be worse if I
was at a desk all day,” she agreed.
“That’s why I love you, sweetie.
You can always nd the silver
lining in everything.”
“I love you too,” he said, taking
her hand. He gazed into her eyes
for a long moment. “Ruth, honey,
I’ve been thinking.”

“About what?”
“Well … you know how much we
love each other.”
“With all our hearts,” she said
sweetly, kissing his fingers.
“And we’ve been together a long
time, and … well … what do you
think about … us spending the
night together?”
Ruth looked thunderstruck. “You
mean … sharing a bed?”
“Yes.”
“And … having sex?”
“Well, I mean, not right away.
We could just lie together the rst
few times, see how it feels, and
then go from there.”

“Eddie,” she said, her tone
suddenly quite serious, “we’re
Christians.”
“I know we are. And I want to
do the correct thing in the eyes of
the Lord, but if we really love each
other, then wouldn’t God be okay
with it?”
“Honey, I don’t know—you’re
talking about premarital relations,”
she said, glancing away as she
processed the enormity of what he
was proposing.
As she turned, he noticed a small
dollop of semen trickling down her
left cheek. “Oop, you got a little
somethin’ there,” he said, taking

out his handkerchief and dabbing
gently at the milky fluid.
“Thanks.” She smiled. “But,
Eddie, I … God, I’m not sure it’d be
right.”
“Okay. I understand. But maybe
think about it?”
Before she could answer, Albert
came barreling over to the table
and sat down with a defeated
expression.
“I’m out,” he declared.
“Huh?” said Edward.
“I’m out. I’m gone. I’m getting
outta here, and I’m going to San
Francisco.”
“What?” Ruth looked at him with

concern.
“Yeah, I just wanted to say
goodbye.”
“Whoa, whoa, Al … are you
serious?” Edward asked with a
furrowed brow. “Is this because of
Louise?”
“Yes, I’m fucking serious. There’s
nothing but shit for me here, and
I’m out. I hate the frontier, I hate
everything in it, I’m done.”
And then all hell broke loose.
It started over at the bar, where
rat-faced Lewis had ordered a shot
of whiskey. As he lifted the glass to
his lips, a young cowboy standing

directly behind him threw his head
back and let out a bellowing
gu aw, presumably over some joke
told by one of his cohorts. The back
of his head knocked against
Lewis’s. Not hard, but just enough
to send the drink spilling out of the
glass and all over Lewis’ shirt. The
young cowboy, obviously already
inebriated, whirled around with a
bellicose glare.
“Hey, watch it, pal!” he barked,
exhaling smoke from his cigarette
directly into Lewis’s face.
Lewis did not inch. “I think you
owe me a drink, fella.”
The cowboy laughed derisively.

“Like hell I do. You best watch
where you stand.”
Lewis moved an inch closer. He
was slightly smaller than the other
man but somehow appeared far
more threatening. “I don’t think
you heard me,” he said softly. “I’m
thirsty.”
“Well, then, go down to the river
and take a dunk.”
Lewis narrowed his eyes. “Last
chance, kid.”
The young cowboy regarded him
for a beat, appearing to register
the severity in Lewis’s gaze. He
picked up an empty shot glass,
poured a fresh shot of whiskey, and

handed it politely to Lewis. Lewis
accepted it
graciously,
even
hoisting the glass a bit in apparent
acknowledgment of the peace
o ering. Then, as Lewis lifted the
whiskey to his lips, the young
cowboy
grinned widely
and
dropped his lit cigarette into the
glass.
Lewis looked down at the gray
ash oating in the amber uid,
promptly drew his gun, and red.
The young cowboy was dead in
seconds.
His friends wasted no time. One
of the other men grabbed the
nearest bottle o
the bar and

smashed it across Lewis’s head.
Blood streamed from his face as he
tore furiously at the shards of glass
jutting out of his ruined flesh.
“That was my bottle, you son of
a bitch!” somebody shouted, and in
an instant, the entire saloon
erupted like a volcano. Dirty,
sweaty, drunk men began to
indiscriminately swing roundhouse
punches at one another, breaking
chairs,
glasses,
bottles,
and
anything else they could get their
hands on.
“Oh, shit!” Albert cried, bolting
to his feet. “Why the fuck does this
always have to happen?! Two guys

get in a ght and then suddenly we
all have to start fighting!”
“C’mon, hurry, get in position!”
Edward exclaimed as he grabbed
Albert and pulled him into the
corner. They fell into it, as they
had countless times before: an
animated urry of pretend punches
thrown furiously at each other,
while being very careful never to
make contact. The idea was that,
as long as they appeared to be
brawling along with everyone else,
neither one of them would make an
easy target for any genuine
violence.
“Ooh! Ow! We got our own thing

going on over here!” shouted
Edward.
“Yeah, and it’s really bad! Ouch,
stop ghting me!” Albert hollered
back.
“Ow, this is so intense over
here!”
“Yeah, nobody needs to get in on
this! We’re both getting hurt pretty
bad!”
One
of
Edward’s
punches
accidentally connected.
“OW!” Albert yelped, with a
sizable flinch.
“Oh, my God, I’m so sorry!” cried
Edward.
“You actually hit me!”

“Albert, I’m really sorry, I didn’t
mean to.”
“Do I have a mark?”
“Yeah, there’s a little redness
there.”
“Yeah, it feels like it.”
“You want a moist rag?”
Before Albert could respond,
something caught his eye across the
room. On the upper level near the
brothel,
two
cowboys
were
pummeling each other
ercely.
One clearly had the advantage as
he delivered blow after blow,
sending his opponent crashing
against the wooden railing. It
began to crack. Albert could not

have
cared less
about
the
destruction of saloon property, but
what did concern him was Anna
Barnes, the newcomer. She stood
just below the upper level,
surveying the fray with an oddly
detached look in her eye, almost
like
a
disapproving
mother
watching her children scu ing in
the mud, ruining their Sunday
clothes. The slugfest continued
directly above her, and Albert
watched with alarm as the railing
began
to
collapse.
Without
thinking, he broke free of his makebelieve st ght with Edward and
sprinted straight through the center

of the mêlée toward the opposite
end of the room.
Miraculously, all he got was a
stray elbow in the ribs and a splash
of beer in the eye before he
reached Anna Barnes. He grabbed
her arm and yanked her out of the
way as hard as he could, just as the
battered cowboy above came
crashing down from the upper
level, bringing a hailstorm of
heavy wooden debris along with
him.
Anna turned and looked at
Albert with surprise. She opened
her mouth to speak, but before she
could say a word, a whiskey bottle

ew past her face, shattering
against the wall inches from her
head.
“Come on!” Albert yelled, pulling
her along with him by the wrist as
he scurried out through the batwing
doors. The two of them half-ran,
half-stumbled out into the evening
air and the relative safety of the
dusty thoroughfare.
Anna turned to Albert. “Thank
you,” she said.
It was the rst time he’d heard
her speak, he noted, and she had a
pleasant alto quality to her voice.
Even from two words, he was
aware of her markedly undisturbed

reaction to what had been a
potentially traumatizing close call.
She didn’t appear shaken or out of
breath in any way whatsoever.
Albert, for his part, was heaving
with the aftershocks of panic as he
bent over to brush the dust o his
trousers.
BANG! BANG!
He jolted upright, just in time to
see Sheri Arness and his deputy
racing into the saloon, guns
blazing into the air.
“Let’s get the fuck outta here,” he
said with a resurgence of agitation.
The two of them made their way
up the street, away from the chaos.

Neither said anything for a
while. Albert was painfully aware
that this woman was giving him
time to collect himself before she
struck up any kind of a
conversation. He felt silly. She’d
been the one in danger, and yet
she seemed utterly at ease.
Meanwhile, his hands were still
shaking.
“Nice work back there,” she
remarked at last. “I guess you’re a
real hero, huh?”
“Oh, no, I’m not the hero,” he
answered with a ushed face. “I’m
the guy in the crowd making fun of
the hero’s shirt.”

She gave a small chuckle, which
was promptly interrupted by a loud
bark. Plugger came bounding out
of the darkness and happily fell
into step beside Anna, giving her
hand a friendly lick.
“Hey, look who’s here.” She
smiled. “This is Plugger.”
“Oh, hey, Plugger,” Albert said,
gamely scratching the mangy dog’s
head. He turned and regarded
Anna with a look of curiosity.
“So … that was your brother, huh?”
“Lewis, yeah.” She rolled her
eyes.
“Uh-huh. Does he generally
commit murder over beverage-

related disputes?”
“He’s always been a little
rambunctious.”
“Yeah,
he
seems
like
a
character,” Albert deadpanned.
“You’re okay, though?”
“Oh, I’ve seen him do it a
hundred times. I don’t have to
worry about Lewis, he’ll pull
himself out no problem.”
“Well, that’s … that’s good, I
guess. I’m, uh … I’m Albert, by the
way,” he said, offering a hand.
She shook it rmly. “I’m Anna.
Nice to meet you, Albert.”
“So, you guys just got into town,
huh? Welcome to our awesome

town,” he said, grandly extending
an
arm to show o
the
unremarkable shithole that was Old
Stump.
“Thanks.” She smiled. “Lewis and
I moved here from Kansas City.”
“Kansas, huh?”
“No, it’s in Missouri.”
“Oh, right. That’s annoying and
weird.”
“Yeah, we were wanting a
change, so we came out to the
frontier looking to build a farm.”
Plugger jabbed at her leg with his
nose, a dry stick hanging out of his
mouth. She plucked it from his jaws
and tossed it farther up the

thoroughfare. The dog scurried
after it with clumsy urgency.
“Really? I’m a farmer myself,” he
said without pride or enthusiasm.
“I have a farm about two miles
from here.”
“Oh. Cattle?”
“Sheep.”
“Ah.”
“Yeah.”
“Well, that’s gotta be ful lling
work, right?” she asked, plainly
hearing the dolefulness in his voice.
“It’s great,” he answered atly.
“It’s like being a dog walker for a
hundred and
fty really stupid
dogs.”

She laughed openly for the rst
time. “It can’t be that bad. Sheep
are cute.”
“That’s the problem. I mean, if I
was a cattle farmer, that’d be one
thing, y’know? That’s a manly job.
You use cows to make beef.
Leather. Tough things. With sheep
you make sweaters. I’m basically a
sweater farmer.”
“That’s good; we’re all hoping
for a bountiful sweater harvest this
year.”
Their stroll came to a halt as
they reached the fat, ugly tree
stump that jutted up from the
ground smack in the center of the

thoroughfare. “I’m assuming this is
why the town is called Old Stump,”
Anna said.
“Yeah, this is it.” He sighed with
boredom. “When they built the
town, they had to cut down this big
tree, but they couldn’t move the
stump. They didn’t have any
dynamite and they ran out of black
guys, so they had to leave it here,
right in the middle of the street.”
“Well, why couldn’t they just
build the town fty feet that way?”
she asked, pointing off to her left.
Albert stared at the stump. No
one had ever asked that question
before. It was a very good

question. He thought it best to
move on. “So, why would you
leave Kansas City for the Western
frontier?” he asked. “I mean, it
sucks out here.”
“I don’t know—it’s exciting,” she
said, with a bright, attentive gaze,
as if seeing a completely di erent
town than he was. “Everything’s so
new and unpredictable.”
“Well, that is true, nothing is
what it seems. Like, look—see that
building right there? We have no
idea what’s inside. I mean, it could
b e anything. This whole place has
such an air of mystery about it.” He
gave her his best wide-eyed

impression of awestruck curiosity
as he pointed to a shabby structure
with the single word BANK painted
on the front.
Anna laughed again. “I’m getting
the sense that you’re kind of a
negative guy.”
“Well, Jesus, look where I live,”
he grumbled. “Oh, hey, here’s a fun
fact about the American West in
1882. You receive the same
punishment whether you’re a horse
thief or a retarded newborn.”
“They hang retarded newborns?”
“Yep, as a warning to others. I
shit you not.” He sighed. “But none
of it is my problem anymore. I’m

leaving tomorrow.”
“Really? Where are you going?”
“San Francisco. You know,
civilization. A place where you’re
not taking your life in your hands
in eight di erent ways just by
walking to the outhouse to shit.”
“Well, you gotta do what makes
you happy, I guess.” She shrugged.
“Happy is a tall order,” he said,
staring o
toward the moonlit
mesas in the distance, “but at least
this’ll make me not dead.”
She studied his face for a
moment, and he became acutely
aware of being sized up by an
expert. “Could it be,” she asked

with raised eyebrows, “that you are
also a man with a broken heart?”
A man who’s been through a
recent breakup will seize on any
and every opportunity to relive his
misery by telling his story to
anyone who will listen, and Albert
was no di erent. Perhaps it was
because he secretly hoped that
eventually, if he spread the word
far and wide enough, someone
would emerge with a magic bullet
of sorts: that one piece of sage
counsel, that one solution he hadn’t
thought of, that one thing that
could x his life and get Louise
back.

He grabbed ahold of the
moment. “Since you brought it up,
can I unload all my shit on you?”
She smiled. “Well, I do owe you
one.”
From high up on the ridge, the
lonely, ramshackle town of Old
Stump appeared almost idyllic. It
lay nestled below them, just a few
soft orange lights glowing amidst
the vast darkness of the cold desert
night. Albert and Anna sat on a
wide rocky outcropping, a spot
that Albert had been coming to
since he was a little boy. He called
it the “swearing place.” When he

was a child, his mother and father
had been strict Puritans who would
not tolerate any foul language
inside the house. So Albert would
save up his cuss words till the end
of each week, write them all down
on a sheet of paper, then climb to
the top of the ridge and shout them
across the plains as loud as he
could. It was perfectly cathartic,
and he always felt better after
screaming
a
mouthful
of
obscenities out at the hot,
depressing frontier he loathed so
very much.
“I did everything in the world for
her,” he said, picking absently at a

handful of dead grass. “If she was
happy, I was happy. That’s all I
cared about. I was generally broke,
but I’d save every scrap of extra
income just to buy her gifts as
often as I could: a bouquet of roses,
a new bonnet, a bottle of perfume,
anything to remind her as often as
possible how important she was to
me and how much I loved her. She
was the one thing that made the
shootings and the wild animals and
the Indians and the disease and the
general depressing awfulness of the
West somehow bearable.”
“How did you and Louise meet?”
asked Anna.

“We both had dysentery in the
same hospital.”
“Oh.”
Albert allowed himself a sad
smile at the tender recollection. “I
was over in Sherman Creek for a
f e w days buying sheep stu , and
that’s when the outbreak hit.
Leveled me for a week straight. I
checked in to the hospital, and
when they assigned me to a bed, I
found that I’d been placed next to
the most beautiful woman I’d ever
seen in my life. God, even in a
sweaty, feverish diarrhetic state,
Louise was an absolute vision.
She’d lived in Sherman Creek her

entire life, and somehow we’d
never crossed paths. Well, we
talked and talked for a week—
there was nothing else to do—and
after only a few days it seemed like
we’d known each other our whole
lives. And I’ll tell you, what’s really
special about the whole thing is
that … you know how when you’ve
been in a relationship with
someone for a while and you’re so
comfortable that it doesn’t even
matter if the other person sees you
going to the bathroom? Well, this
was the reverse, because our
relationship started with us shitting
blood in front of each other. And

that bonds people. So she came
back to Old Stump with me, I
helped her get set up with a job as
a schoolmarm, and she’s been here
with me ever since.”
“She a good marm?”
“She can marm. She can
de nitely marm. And the whole
time we were together, I thought,
I’m so happy. How can I possibly be
this happy? One of these days she’s
gonna gure out she’s too good for
me. And then … one day she did.”
Albert let the dead grass fall from
his hands. “I nally tricked one girl
into falling in love with me, and I
lost her.”

Anna regarded him as she
digested the tale. The pain in his
voice was unmistakable, and yet
there was something missing from
the equation.
“Look, obviously I don’t know all
the details,” she said, “but from
what you’ve told me … I think you
got this whole thing upside down. I
mean, it sounds like you’ve had this
girl on a pedestal and treated her
like a queen. You’ve clearly bent
over backward for her, but what’s
she given you back?”
Albert seemed ba ed by the
question. “I told you, she made me
happy in an otherwise rotten

world. I mean, if someone can do
that … well, they deserve to be on
a pedestal.”
“Do you really want to go to San
Francisco?”
“Yes, I—no. I don’t know,” he
said. “I guess I don’t. I want … I
just want Louise.” His voice broke
ever so slightly on the last word.
“Uh-huh.”
Anna
nodded,
accepting the shape of his
predicament at face value for the
moment. “Well, if this Foy guy is
that much of a douche, she’ll gure
it out if she’s smart. Sometimes a
girl has to get a few assholes out of
her system before she realizes what

a good guy looks like.” She patted
him gently on the arm.
And then they heard the rattle.
Albert froze. The sound had come
from his left. He slowly looked
down and saw it slithering between
his foot and Anna’s. It was
practically touching his shoe. “Oh,
fuck,” he said softly.
“That’s a diamondback, isn’t it?”
she said in an equally hushed tone,
but with a surprising degree of
calmness.
“Yeah, it is.”
“Well, fuck.”
“If we hold still, we’ll be fine.”
The snake slid across the tip of

Albert’s foot. He held his breath.
Deadly poisonous snakes were
naturally to be feared out here on
the frontier, but there was also
something about them that Albert
found infuriatingly arrogant. The
way they showed up out of
nowhere and put everyone’s whole
goddamn life on hold for minutes
at a time, striking mortal terror
into the hearts of people who were
just minding their own business. A
man would stand, immobile as a
statue, in fear for his life while the
snake writhed around aimlessly,
taking its sweet time, and not
giving a fuck about anybody but

itself.
“Asshole,” Albert muttered.
“Huh?” said Anna.
“Nothing.”
At
last,
the
diamondback wound its way past
their
little
outcropping
and
slithered o
into the darkness.
Albert and Anna exhaled with
relief.
“So,
you’re
really
leaving
tomorrow,
huh?” she
asked,
casually picking up where they’d
left off.
“Yeah. Tomorrow.”
“Why don’t you at least stay
through the weekend? Isn’t the fair
on Saturday?”

“Oh, fuck that,” Albert snorted.
“Louise is gonna be there, and she’s
gonna be with Foy. No way. I’m
not putting myself through that.”
“Well, then, I’ll go with you,” she
o ered. “I haven’t really made any
other friends since I’ve been in
town, and I could sure use some
fun. Besides, there’s no better way
to make your ex-girlfriend want
you back than to have her see you
with another girl.”
Albert silently acknowledged the
truth of that statement. He sighed.
“Maybe.”
“Especially a smokin’-hot girl.”
She grinned. “She sees me, she’ll be

intimidated as fuck.”
“Oh, you’re very modest, I see,”
said Albert, warming up a bit.
“Yes, I’m a little cocky, but with
these tits I can afford to be.”
For the
rst time in weeks,
Albert Stark laughed.
BAR BRAWLER ARRESTED FOR
MURDER, the headline read. Not
that the toothless old man was
interested in the story. The
newspaper lay draped across his
upper body and face, shielding him
from the vicious morning sun as he
snored peacefully in front of the
sheri ’s o ce. He didn’t notice the

slender shadow that glided over
him as Anna passed through the
doorway.
Sheri Arness sat at his desk,
whittling
some
sort
of
unidenti able animal out of a
small block of wood. Whether it
was a horse or a duck, Anna
couldn’t tell. The sheriff stopped his
whittling and looked up as she
approached.
“Can I help you, ma’am?”
“Yes, I’m here to see my
brother,” she said, her words
heavily weighted with a tone of
disgust.
“Oh, yeah, the Barnes boy,” the

sheri said, putting aside his feeble
attempt at sculpture and rising
from his seat. “You know, he’s in a
lotta trouble.”
“I know.” She rolled her eyes.
“He’s an idiot who can’t control his
temper, and I apologize for that.
Seems like every town we visit, he
winds up behind bars over some
brawl or other.”
“Well, he picked the wrong town
and the wrong brawl,” the sheri
said gravely. “The man he killed is
Pastor
Wilson’s
son.
Pastor
Wilson’s a popular man around
these parts, but that ain’t the half
of it. His cousin is married to one

of them congressmen back east. If I
had to bet on it, I’d say there’s
gonna be a hangin’.”
Anna took a moment to process
this. I’m not certain I could feel sorry
for him even if he were actually my
brother, she thought. “Can I speak
with him?” she asked. Sheri
Arness nodded and got up from his
chair. He led her over to a row of
three cells lined with brown, rusty
bars. In the middle one, Lewis lay
sleeping on a small yellowed cot.
The sheri rattled the creaky bars.
“Barnes! Wake up; you got a
visitor.”
Lewis’s eyes
uttered open.

When he saw Anna, he slowly rose
to his feet with a scowl. His face
was still a mess from the broken
bottle. Clearly the doctor had paid
him a visit, but the wound
dressings
looked
somewhat
inadequate.
Anna turned back to the sheri .
“Do you mind if I have a moment
alone with him?” she asked.
“Go right ahead,” he replied,
seemingly eager to return to his
whittling.
Anna stared at Lewis. “You dumb
asshole,” she said softly.
“Shut up,” he barked. “I didn’t
know who he was. And besides, he

was all up in my face, you saw—”
“You shot the pastor’s son. You
realize they’re probably gonna
hang you.”
Lewis moved closer to the bars
and lowered his own voice. “Oh, is
that what they’re sayin’? Well, who
gives a fuck? When Clinch gets in
to town, it’s not gonna matter what
they do. He’ll bust me out, and
anyone who tries to stop him is
gonna be a dead man.”
“You know something?” she said,
starring him down with conviction.
“One of these days there’s gonna
be a man who’s faster than Clinch.
And stronger. And smarter. And

then Clinch is gonna be the dead
man. And I’m gonna smoke a big,
fat fucking cigar to celebrate.”
Lewis took another step closer to
the bars. Anna did not step back. “I
don’t think Clinch would like you
talkin’ about him that way,” he
said, his eyes narrowing. “Not a
nice thing for a man’s wife to say
about her husband.”
“Well, we’ll see if he gets here in
time, huh?” she said, a hint of a
smile creeping into her expression.
“Tick tock.”
His hand lashed out at her, but
she moved swiftly out of its reach
with a ballerina’s grace. She

whirled around and was gone.
The fairgrounds bustled and
buzzed with the once-a-year
gathering of visitors from three
di erent towns: Sherman Creek,
Bullhead, and Old Stump. The
result of the aggregation was a
crowd of a size rarely seen in these
sparsely populated regions of the
frontier. Merchants cried their
wares, bakers and cooks displayed
all
manner
of
elaborate
confections, and barkers hollered
and gesticulated as they attempted
to lure passersby toward the
games, contests, magicians, and

exotic animals that peppered the
normally barren desert landscape.
It was an uncomfortably hot day as
usual, and Albert wiped his
soaking-wet forehead with his
sleeve as he rode up to the
entrance. As he reined in and
dismounted, he heard a familiar
shuffling sound behind him.
Baaa! Baaaa!
He turned around just in time to
see two of his sheep hurrying to
catch up.
“Oh, Jesus,” he muttered. “Did
you guys follow me all the way
from home? No! Get outta here! Go
home! Jonathan! Andrew! Go!” The

sheep stared at him with puzzled
looks on their u y faces, before
reluctantly turning and awkwardly
shu ing back in the other
direction. Albert sighed as he
tethered Curtis to a wooden
hitching post.
“Hey, sheepboy!” a familiar
voice called out.
Albert turned to see Anna
trotting up on a brown horse that
almost matched the color of her
hair. She wore a light-green dress
with a white ower pattern, and
her hair was down, the curly locks
spilling over her shoulders in a
carefree yet elegant fashion. She’d

worn it up the night of the saloon
brawl, and Albert observed that she
looked decidedly more feminine
today. She greeted him with a
broad smile.
“Hey.” He waved to her,
wondering how anyone with a
sibling who had recently been
arrested for murder could be in
such apparent high spirits. “Jesus, I
heard about your brother,” he said.
“Are you okay?”
“I’m
ne,”
she
answered,
dismounting from her horse. “And,
Albert, do not worry about Lewis.
Anything that happens to him right
now is his own fault. Got it?” The

lightness
in
her
tone
was
undeniable. She really didn’t seem
to be bothered at all.
Albert shrugged, deciding not to
press the matter. “Yeah, sure,” he
said.
“Good!” She playfully tipped his
hat forward over his eyes. “ ’Cause
you know what I wanna do?”
“Um … eat hot food in hundreddegree weather?”
“No.” She laughed. “Get my
picture taken. I’ve never done it
before.”
“That’s horseshit.”
“It’s the truth.”
“No, I mean, that’s horseshit. Be

careful.”
They sidestepped the mound of
equine leavings.
“Come on, let’s go!” Anna
grabbed his hand, and he almost
face-planted in the dirt as she
broke into a run, pulling him
toward the busy fairground.
They made their way through the
excited, perspiring throng toward a
painted wooden sign reading
PHOTOGRAPHS!
MADE
BY
LIGHTNING AND GOD HIMSELF!
Albert had had his photograph
taken only a few times in his life,
but
the
technology
always
intrigued him. He watched as a

family of six clustered together in
front of the large wooden camera.
The photographer huddled under
the
black
covering.
“Okay,
everybody hold still!” he instructed.
The family stood expressionless as
the photographer held up the
ashlamp. After a beat, there was
a loud pop as the fuse ignited the
explosive
magnesium
powder,
momentarily illuminating the rigid,
stone-faced
subjects.
Albert
watched the wisps of residual
smoke dissipate in the air.
Anna turned to him. “Y’know,
supposedly there’s some guy in
Texas who smiled one time while

he was getting his picture taken.”
“Shut the fuck up,” Albert blurted
with excitement. “I was talking
about that just the other day! Are
you serious?”
“I think. I mean, I heard it
somewhere. I dunno if it’s true.”
“Yeah, that sounds like the kinda
bullshit somebody would make up.”
They took their place in line as a
dirt farmer and his wife stepped in
front of the photographer’s camera.
A vendor walked past, selling some
sort of snack that looked like
barbecued meat on a stick.
Realizing he was hungry, Albert
shed a penny out of his pocket

and bought one.
“So.” Anna smiled. “We know
what kind of girl you like. What
kind of girl do you not like?”
“Huh?”
“Like, what’s the worst quality for
you in another person?”
“Oh,
that’s
an
interesting
question.” Albert smiled as he bit
into the meat. He chewed twice,
immediately registered that it
tasted like fermented dog shit, and
spat it onto the ground.
Anna continued. “That dealbreaker thing that you absolutely
cannot tolerate. For me it’s
tobacco-chewing. I don’t care how

much a guy smokes, but if he
chews, forget it. There’s no way I’m
kissing that. And he’s de nitely not
going down on me.”
“Wow, that’s beautiful,” said
Albert. “You should stitch that into
a pillow.”
“Oh, I have. It’s embroidered all
fancy and it says, Don’t go snackin’
if you been tobaccin’.”
Albert couldn’t help but laugh.
Anna smiled and continued to
press him. “What about you?”
He debated whether to be honest
about this one, but there was
something about Anna that made
him feel like he could let his guard

down a bit. “Um … well, you’re
gonna think this is fucked up,
because it is, but … I really can’t
handle it when a girl looks like her
dad.”
“Okay, that’s bizarre. Why?”
“Well … I mean, if I’m dating a
girl, and then I meet her mom and
dad, and it turns out she looks like
him, and I see all the matching
facial features and the bone
structure and whatnot, from then
on every time I kiss her, I’m very
aware that I’m kissing the dad’s
facial geography.”
“I see.”
“Yeah,” he continued. “I was

dating this girl about ten years
ago, and she and her family and I
all went down to the creek for a
swim one day, and her dad took his
shirt o , and he had the exact same
nipples as she did. I had to move to
a different town for a while.”
She took a beat. “I’m surprised
your girlfriend left you.”
Albert took the jab with a laugh.
By now they were next in line
for a photograph, following a
young couple in their early
twenties. “Okay, hold still,” the
photographer called out. He pushed
the
electric
fuse,
and
the
magnesium ash powder exploded.

The young couple and the
photographer were all killed
instantly, their bodies blown to
pieces
and
charred
beyond
recognition.
Albert and Anna quickly scurried
backward
and away from the
calamity as clusters of fairgoers
scrambled to retrieve buckets of
water. “Jesus Christ!” Albert
exclaimed. “This fucking fair!
Every year something happens
and, boom! People die.”
“Really?” Anna said, sounding
almost as shaken as Albert.
“Last year there were two
gun ghts, a stage collapsed, there

were two knife ghts, a drowning,
and the Indians attacked.”
“God, why are the Indians
always so mad?” she wondered.
“I don’t know.”
“I mean, we’re basically splitting
this country fifty-fifty with them.”
“They’re just selfish.”

They made their way deeper into
the fairgrounds, where more
barkers could be heard shouting
over one another, each doing his
best to compete for the attentions
of the passersby.
“Sir! Sir and madam! May I
divert your attention over here for
a moment!” The weathered-looking
peddler at the small kiosk
appeared to be selling all manner
of tonics, elixirs, powders, and
salves. His eyes widened with
eager delight as he registered
Albert and Anna’s approach. He
instantly set about arranging a
display of his nest samples on the

ta ble in front of him. “Welcome,
welcome! Can I interest you in a
miracle cure? Only the
nest
healing tonics and elixirs procured
from the farthest corners of the
globe!” He presented Albert with a
small green bottle.
Albert read the label. “Ogden’s
Celebrated Stomach Bitters.” He
looked up at the peddler. “Can
I … can I just ask—celebrated by
whom? Who’s celebrating stomach
bitters?”
Anna took the bottle and turned
it around to read the back. “God,
look at the ingredients,” she said,
wrinkling her nose. “Alcohol,

cocaine, morphine, mercury with
chalk—what the hell is mercury with
chalk?”
“Science!” The peddler grinned
with a theatrical flourish.
Albert continued reading the
ingredients. “And red annel. Red
flannel? There’s shirt in here?”
“Pieces of shirt,” the peddler said
with enthusiasm.
“Okay, thank you.” Albert
handed the bottle back to him,
o ering a polite smile as he and
Anna stepped away.
The peddler desperately grabbed
another bottle, holding it up as he
called after them. “Would you care

to try some Parker’s Liquid Beef
Tonic?”
Albert sighed. “You’d think these
guys would know everybody’s
caught on to the fact that it’s all
just booze with fancier labels and
—” He stopped in his tracks. “Oh,
God.”
“What?” asked Anna.
“That’s them.”
Just ahead, strolling arm in arm
and looking like bliss incarnate,
were Louise and Foy. She sipped a
glass of lemonade with a look of
utter contentment on her face, as
Foy whispered something in her
ear. She turned and graced the

moustachier with a smile so
adoring that Albert’s heart plunged
suicidally from his chest into the pit
of his stomach. To make matters
worse, there was no way to pass
the two of them without being
noticed.
Albert frantically grabbed Anna’s
elbow. “Shit, here they come!
Quick, let’s pretend you just said
something funny.” Albert had
already burst into loud, uproarious
laughter before he realized he’d
fucked up. “Wait, no—shit! You
p r e t e n d I just said something
funny!”
Anna grinned at him. “Come on,

introduce me,” she said, taking his
arm and pulling him forward.
“No!” he whispered frantically.
“No, no, no, no—”
But by then it was too late. Anna
waved enthusiastically at the two
young lovers. “Hi, there,” she said.
“Foy and Louise, right?”
“That’s right,” Foy said, his usual
cocky con dence mixed with an air
of amused curiosity.
There was an awkward pause as
Anna turned her smile back to
Albert. He knew he had no choice
but to play along. “Uh, this is
Anna,” he said nervously. “She’s,
uh …”

“I’m
his
girlfriend,”
Anna
finished for him.
“She’s my girlfriend,” Albert said,
reluctantly taking the cue. “The
new GF. Big-time.”
“Lot of sexual activity with us,”
Anna offered.
“Y-yeah,”
Albert
stuttered,
shooting her a what-the-fuck
glance. He turned his focus back to
Foy and Louise, trying to roll with
the cards Anna had dealt him.
“Nonstop. I … I practically live
inside her. So … y’know, if you
ever want to write me a letter, you
have to address it c/o Anna’s
Vagina.”

Louise’s
expression
clearly
indicated
she’d
already
had
enough. She clutched Foy’s arm
tighter. “Sweetie, why don’t we go
see the freak tent,” she said.
“Hey, we were just about to try
the shooting gallery,” Anna piped
in. “Wanna join?”
“Wait, what?” Albert turned to
her with an expression of mild
panic. The last thing he needed
was for Louise to be reminded of
how useless he was with a gun.
Anna smiled at Albert. “Come
on, it’ll be fun,” she said with
enthusiasm.
Louise’s gaze moved up and

down Anna’s body. “Y’know, I
actually have that same dress,” she
remarked coolly.
In contrast, the tone of Anna’s
response was warm and genuine.
“Oh, you do?”
“Yeah, I wore it to the fair two
years ago. Good for you for trying
to bring it back.”
“Well, it just seems to me that
only a complete moron would
throw away a perfectly good
thing.” She shot Albert a sly wink
that made him feel suddenly,
strangely protected and looked
after. She turned her attention back
to Foy. “Now. how ’bout that

shooting gallery, huh?”
“I’m game,” said Foy. “And I say
we make things interesting. A
nickel a target.”
“That’s, uh—that’s a little rich for
my blood,” Albert objected. “How
’bout a penny?”
“What’s the matter, Albert?” Foy
sneered. “Is business ba-a-a-a-a-aad?” He laughed at his own joke.
“Very well, then, a penny it is.
Good Lord, Albert, you’re such a
sheepskate.”
This time, Louise laughed with
him.
“Louise, get ready to shear me
on!” A big, mustachioed guffaw.

“I really love your humor,”
Louise whispered sweetly to Foy.
Before Albert could drop to the
ground and shrivel up like a dying
insect, Anna took his arm again.
“Then let’s get to it, huh?” She
smiled, pulling Albert toward the
booth.
He whispered furiously into her
ear. “What the hell are you doing?
I suck balls at the shooting
gallery!”
“Relax, it’ll be ne,” she said,
giving his hand a little squeeze.
They stepped up to the booth,
where Foy paid the vendor. True to
character, he tossed Albert a smirk

that seemed to say, I’ll take care of
this. I know money’s tight for you.
The vendor handed Foy a gun. Foy
reached into his pocket, took out a
small tin of wax, and smoothed the
tips of his moustache with
preening, peacockian
air. The
vendor pulled a lever, and the
targets popped up. There were
twelve of them, each one depicting
the same caricature of a bug-eyed
black slave in tattered overalls,
posed as if on the run. Jesus Christ,
Albert thought, what the hell’s wrong
with rabbits or ducks? The targets
appeared and disappeared at
random
intervals
and
with

aggressive speed. Foy aimed his
weapon and
red six times,
emptying the chamber. Six targets
went down.
“Six hits!” the vendor called out.
“Quite a marksman!”
The crackle of applause lled the
air from the small group of
spectators who had gathered close
by. Foy smugly handed Albert the
gun. “This should be amusing,” the
moustachier chuckled.
Albert took the pistol and raised
it with obvious reluctance. Why the
fuck would Anna do this to me?
He red six times. Not a single
target went down. The crowd

laughed derisively as he lowered
his head, trying to avoid eye
contact with anybody. In his
peripheral vision, standing among
a cluster of townsfolk, was the
twelve-year-old girl with whom
he’d had the awkward dinner date.
Another girl about the same age
turned and whispered to her,
loudly enough for Albert to hear,
“Didn’t you date that guy?”
“Yeah, but it didn’t go so well.”
“What was the problem?”
“Eh, he was kind of a loser. Plus
it just sorta felt like I was dating
my dad.”
“Wait, aren’t you dating your

dad now?”
“Yeah.”
“How’s that going?”
“It’s going good.”
Foy folded his arms and stared at
Albert with triumphant arrogance.
“Looks like that’s six cents you owe
me, sheepherder.”
Albert glumly fished in his pocket
for the six cents that would be
meaningless to Foy but that Albert
would sorely miss. He counted the
pennies and held them out in his
palm.
But, to his surprise, Anna
intercepted the money with a quick
swipe. “Hang on a second,” she

said, giving Foy an odd smile. “You
wanna
make
this
more
interesting?”
Foy folded his arms with smug
curiosity and waited for her to
continue.
“If I can shoot all twelve targets
on Albert’s behalf, you owe him a
dollar,” she said. “If I can’t, he
owes you a dollar.”
Albert’s head whipped around to
face her with alarm. He most
certainly did not have a dollar to
squander on such an uncertain
endeavor.
“Whoa, hang on—” he began,
but the crowd was already catching

the fever. They began to holler
with excitement. “A dollar?!” “I’ve
never seen a dollar!” “Nobody has
a dollar!” “Let us see the dollar!”
Foy, however, never shifted his
gaze away from Anna. “Well, now,
t h a t is interesting.” He smirked.
“All right, then. It’s a bet. Do your
best … ma’am.” The last word was
heavily greased with derision. He
handed her the pistol, and she
turned back to the vendor.
“May I have a second gun,
please?” she asked. The vendor
hesitated brie y, then handed her a
second pistol. She held one in each
hand as she aimed up at the

targets. “Oh, one more thing,” she
said. “Can that machine go any
faster?”
“Well, yeah, you can play double
or triple speed, but that’s—”
“Fastest speed you got,” she said.
He nodded reluctantly and
turned a metal crank on the
underside of the gallery. For the
first time since the beginning of the
afternoon’s encounter, Foy did not
look entirely sure of himself. His
eyes narrowed with suspicion and
just a touch of what looked to
Albert like fear, though he could
not be sure.
During the initial two salvos, the

targets
had
appeared
and
disappeared at a rapid- re pace.
But it was downright leisurely
compared to what was happening
now. No sooner had the little
cartoon black guys popped up than
they were gone again. The whole
gallery looked to be one continuous
blur of motion, too fast for the
human eye to register.
Anna hit every target.
The vendor looked stunned. The
boisterous crowd had gone utterly
silent. Anna shot Albert a secret
little smile that came and went as
quickly as the gallery targets, then
casually set down her guns.

Albert became aware that his jaw
was hanging wide open. “Holy
shit,” he whispered to no one in
particular.
“That’ll be one dollar,” Anna
said. It was now her turn to ash a
smug grin at Foy, who looked
properly humiliated. He reached
into his coat pocket with a scowl
and removed a crisp one-dollar
note. The crowd went into an
uproar.
“There it is!” “Dear God, look at
it!” “It’s beautiful!” One father
scolded his young son, “Take your
hat off! That’s a dollar bill!”
Clearly looking to salvage at

least one nger of the upper hand,
Foy turned his attention back to
Albert.
“Well, well. A man who lets his
girlfriend do his shooting for him.
I s n ’ t that a ne how-do-you-do.”
The crowd tittered but without
enough gaiety for Foy to feel
redeemed. He repeated himself
with more volume. “I say, isn’t that
a ne how-do-you-do!” The crowd
dutifully upped their laughter in
response.
Albert glared, feeling a worm of
anger gnawing at his insides, but
he could not for the life of him
come up with a topper. “That’s not

funny,” was his accid response.
“You’re not funny.”
Foy put an arm around Louise’s
slender waist. “Your ex-boyfriend
doesn’t seem to have a sense of
humor,” he said. “I can see why
you dumped him.”
Albert had never been timid
about expressing
feelings of
displeasure, but he did have a
relatively long fuse. Foy had lit
that fuse the rst day Albert saw
him walk out of the moustachery
locked arm in arm with Louise. The
pompous bastard had stolen the
one true love of Albert’s life, and
the fuse had been growing shorter

day by day since then.
It had nally reached the powder
keg.
Albert lurched forward, putting
himself two inches from Foy’s face.
“You wanna back up that attitude,
asshole?”
Una ected by the burst of
hostility, Foy’s expression turned to
one of gleeful disbelief. “You’re
kidding.”
“Never been more serious in my
life. Pistols. You and me.”
“You wouldn’t have a prayer,
kiddo.”
“Tomorrow. 8 A.M. sharp.”
A crooked smile oozed across

Foy’s face. “All right. Challenge
accepted.”
Anna, who had been silently
observing the exchange between
the two men, suddenly spoke up.
“Ooh, gosh, y’know, tomorrow’s
bad for me, and I really wanna be
there. How about one week from
today? That work for you, Albert?”
There was a pointed weight to
the way she said his name that
sliced a tiny notch into his tenacity.
“Yeah, sure,” he said.
“One week,” Foy a rmed.
“Come on, Louise. I’ll buy you
some sugared butter shavings.” He
planted a kiss on her lips—that

was clearly more of a theatrical
aunt for Albert’s bene t than an
expression of a ection for Louise—
then took her hand and led her o
into the crowd.
Albert let out an exhale that
could have inflated a rubber boat.
“ O h , fuck,”
he
exclaimed,
throwing his head back and
covering his face with his palms.
“Wow,” Anna said with raised
eyebrows and a hint of a smile.
“What … the hell … did I just
do?!”
“You challenged Foy to a
gunfight.”
The old Albert had returned.

Whatever impassioned forces had
taken control of his body and mind
a few moments before were now
long gone.
“ O h , Jesus,” he said, panic
creeping into his voice. “I fuckin’
snapped! I didn’t even know what I
was saying!”
“It’s interesting,” said Anna. “Did
you see the look on Louise’s face?”
“No, what do you mean?”
“She was alert. Aroused. She was
impressed.”
“She was?” He sounded a shred
calmer.
“Yeah, she was. You had a re in
your belly for a second there, pal.

And I bet you never showed her
that side of you before.”
He grew ustered again. “I don’t
have that side! I honestly don’t
know
what
the
fuck
just
happened!”
“Well, you de nitely got her
attention. You beat that guy in a
gun ght, and I bet she thinks twice
about dumping you.”
“You … you think so?”
“Yup.”
“Wait a second, no! Anna, this is
insane! I can’t be in a gun ght!
What am I, Clinch Leatherwood
here? I’ll get killed—”
She whirled to face Albert with a

look of intensity that he had never
seen from her. “Why would you say
that?”
For a moment he was at a loss
for words. Her entire aura of
serene self-possession had blown
away in an instant, and he had no
idea why. For lack of an
explanation, he chose to simply
answer her question. “Because he’s
the most vicious gun ghter in the
territory. Which I am not!”
“No, you’re de nitely not Clinch
Leatherwood.” The ash of tension
vanished as quickly as it had
appeared, and she was all Anna
once more. “And don’t worry. That

week I bought you is enough time
for me to teach you how to shoot.”
Albert suddenly realized that the
biggest question of the day
remained unasked. “Yeah, and
that’s another thing—how the hell
can you shoot like that? Who the
hell are you?”
She xed him with a sincere
gaze. “My father was a gunmaker.
I’ve been ring guns since I could
walk.” It was a plausible enough
explanation. But before he could
inquire further, she took him by the
arm and led him back toward the
hitching
posts.
“Come
on,
sheepboy, we’ve got work to do.”

The sun beat down on them with
ruthless oppression as they rode
toward Albert’s farm.
Albert stared down at the pinkish
burned skin on his arms and
thought, What a terrible thing it is to
be outdoors. If you covered
yourself, you baked in the heat. If
you uncovered yourself, you fried
in the sun. It didn’t seem to bother
Anna, however.
Nothing ever seemed to bother
Anna.
Albert regarded his new friend
with a fresh curiosity. Who was this
un appable, nerveless woman who
possessed a wisdom far beyond her

years and could shoot like Wyatt
Earp? He had developed a quick,
comfortable bond with her over the
last few days—enough to share all
the private details of his fragile
emotional state—but, in reality, he
knew very little about her … and
he had the distinct sense that there
was more to tell than he had been
privy to.
As they approached the farm, the
sheep began to baa excitedly. As
usual, they were everywhere but
inside the corral. One was even
sitting on the front porch as if it
owned the place and was waiting
for somebody to serve it a mint

julep. Albert sighed and ignored
the problem for the moment. As
Anna had requested, he went inside
the barn and fetched an armload of
rusty tin cans.
She gave him a reassuring wink
and arranged them equidistant
from one another along the top of
the fence. She handed the pistol to
Albert. “Okay, go ahead.”
He grimaced. “I don’t know what
you’re expecting, but I’m—”
“I’m not expecting anything, I’m
just observing. Go ahead. Don’t be
nervous, there’s nobody watching
but me.”
Albert reluctantly raised the

pistol and closed one eye, aiming it
as best he knew how. He emptied
every bullet in the chamber but did
not hit a single can. Even the fence
itself was undamaged.
Ten reloads and ten more
attempts did not change a thing.
Finally he slumped to the ground in
despair. “This is never gonna
work,” he groaned.
“Yes, it is. Will you just trust me?
It’ll work, and Louise is gonna
come running back to you.”
Albert turned to her and stared.
Never in his life had he met such an
enigma. “Hey,” he said, “why are
you being so nice to me?”

She laughed. “What’s wrong with
being nice?”
“Nothing, nothing, but, I mean,
you show up outta nowhere, you’re
this complete anomaly in my world
of terribleness out here—Anna, you
must have a million better things to
do.”
“What, I can’t make a new
friend? When I met you, you
looked like you could use one.” Her
expression was almost coy. She
really is quite beautiful, Albert
observed. But he still wanted
answers.
“Look, I just—I really don’t know
anything about you,” he said.

“I promise I’m not a crazy
psycho chick.” She smiled.
“No, that’s not what I mean.”
“Can I ask you something about
you?”
“Sure.”
“Why do you love Louise?”
An interesting thing happened
then. Albert suddenly realized that
the past two minutes were the very
rst since the breakup that Louise
had not been in his thoughts. But,
of course, the mention of her name
brought her luminous image
rushing right back to the forefront
of his brain: her long, owing
blond locks, her velvety-soft skin,

the big blue pools on either side of
her petite nose … pools that a man
could drown in …
He had never been asked to
quantify his love for Louise, nor
had he ever thought to do so. It
was something that needed no
explanation. It was true love, pure
and simple, and he’d always
accepted it at face value with
eagerness and gratitude.
Thus, it took him a moment to
assemble his answer. “My God, I
couldn’t even count all the
reasons,” he said. “I feel great
when I’m with her. And I feel great
a bout myself. I’m proud when I’m

with her, y’know? I mean, she’s the
picture of class, but she’s also got
this fun, playful side, and of course
she’s insanely gorgeous.… ”
“Well, she’s quite stunning, yes,”
said Anna, “but honestly—and I’m
sorry to say this—I really don’t see
what else she’s got going for her.”
“Oh, you just don’t know her;
she’s got a lot more to her than
that,” Albert said with a trace of
defensiveness.
“Look, I could be dead wrong,
and it’s only a rst impression, but
my sense was that she’s kinda sour
and self-absorbed.”
“No, not at all. Trust me, I’ve—”

“Yes, I know, you’ve known her
a lot longer than I have, but keep
in mind you’re not exactly the most
objective analyst here. And also—
big news—I’m a woman. Women
can read other women a hell of a
lot better than men can. Like I
said, I could be way o base, but
it’s a pretty strong vibe. And for a
guy like you, with so much going
for him, I would think—”
“Well, let’s not get hysterical. I’m
not sure exactly what you think I
have going for me.”
“See, there you go, cutting
yourself down again. You act like
this girl was performing a

charitable act by dating you. It’s
really frustrating. Albert, you’re
sweet, you’re funny, you’re smart.
And you’ve made something of
yourself. You know, a lot of people
out here can’t say that. You’re a
good sheep farmer.”
“Oh, please, that’s a bunch of
bullshit. I suck at sheep. Look
around you. Louise is right, I can’t
keep track of them at all. There
was a sheep in the whorehouse last
week.”
“Really?”
“Yeah, it wandered in there, and
when I went to pick it up,
somehow it had made twenty

dollars.”
Anna laughed loudly. It was a
sweet, satisfying sound. In fact,
Albert was struck by just how
quenching it was to hear. Why is
that? he wondered. Had he ever felt
that way when Louise laughed at
one of his jokes? And then it
occurred to him: Louise had never
laughed at his jokes. She had
smiled, yes. But she’d never
actually laughed. Albert mulled this
realization. But doesn’t that make
those smiles that much more
meaningful?
Sure,
we
didn’t
necessarily share the same sense of
humor, but she never failed with that

smile after every joke. She made the
effort. Still, Anna’s laughter was
welcome.
“Thanks,” Albert said to her. “For
saying those things about me. I
guess I’m not used to much
positivity in my life.”
She put a hand on his arm.
“Look, the West sucks,” she said,
“but your problem isn’t just the
frontier. It’s you. You need a little
con dence boost.” She tightened
her grip and raised his arm,
helping him aim the pistol back
toward the cans. “Now try again,
sheepboy,” she said.
He gave her a cringing smile.

“Yeah, that sheepboy thing isn’t
helping the ol’ confidence.”
“I like sheepboy.”
“You’re basically calling me a
pussy.”
“Point your gun that way,
pussy.”
The rst ve bullets missed the
cans by as wide a margin as
before. But on the sixth shot, one of
the cans went down.
“Yes!” she shouted gleefully,
jumping like a schoolgirl. “There
ya go, pussy!”
Albert
stared,
legitimately
astonished despite himself. “Holy
shit,” he exclaimed, wide-eyed. “So,

all I gotta do is get Foy to let me
shoot seventy-one times before he
shoots, and I win!”
Anna laughed again. “You’ll get
there, I promise.”
During the following days she
drilled him. Hard and often.
Everything from tin cans on fences
to hand-drawn paper targets to
airborne ceramic plates. And soon,
armed with the ominous knowledge
that what hung in the balance was
not only the love of his life but his
very life itself, Albert began to
improve.
The lessons were not without

their bruises, of course. He grazed
his big toe on the rst day. On the
third day he cut his wrist on a tin
can. And on the fth day he got
smashed in the face by one of the
ceramic plates that Anna hurled
into the air for him to shoot.
Although Albert’s face was bleeding
profusely from the gash, a trip to
Doctor Harper proved less than
helpful. When the doctor tried to
place a blue jay near the wound so
it could peck out the blood and
prevent infection, Albert and Anna
politely declined treatment, opting
instead for a homemade dressing.
Each day he hit more and more

of the targets, until at last he was
hitting more than he missed. This
was a milestone, and Anna felt it
was time for a little reward. She
waited until the approach of
sunset, then took him up to the
ridge overlooking Old Stump—the
“swearing place” they had visited
that very rst night. They leaned
against a rock face and stared out
at the spectacular vista of the
southern Arizona landscape.
“You did great today.” She
smiled. “You’re so much better than
you were before.”
“I guess,” he said softly. The
impending reality of the gun ght

was now truly beginning to sink in.
I could be dead in a couple of days,
he thought.
Anna sensed his anxiety. “Hey, I
have a surprise for you,” she said,
reaching into the pocket of her
dress. “You’ve earned one of Anna
Barnes’s very special super secret
cookies.” She pulled the cookie
from her pocket, took a bite, and
offered it to Albert.
He stared at it as if it were a live
tarantula. “Wait, is this … is this a
weed cookie?”
“Yes, it’s a weed cookie.” She
laughed.
“Oh, no, I … I don’t do well with

that stuff.”
“That’s ’cause you’re too uptight.
This’ll help. Just have a little.” She
moved it toward his mouth, and he
backed away.
“No. No way.” He squirmed. “It’s
like my worst fear to OD on a
recreational drug.”
“Albert, it’s just pot. Have a
small bite. C’mon, do it for me.”
She had him beat. Anna had been
such a pal to him since she arrived
in Old Stump that he would’ve felt
like a loser had he declined a
request from her that was phrased
in such a way. But his past
experiences with pot—eaten or

smoked—had been less than
mellow. Once, after sharing a few
too many pu s with a group of
peer-pressuring schoolmates, he
had been certain that Jim
Wegman, the blacksmith, was
somehow controlling the rhythm of
Albert’s breathing with the clang of
his hammer. Another time Albert
had own into a panic when the
room began to spin, so he’d lain
down on the ground, only to
become terri ed that remaining
motionless for over ten seconds
was how people became paralyzed.
After a good twenty minutes of
lying on his back while waving his

arms and legs like an upended
beetle in the hopes of staving off
paralysis, he had nally started to
regain his senses.
Albert took a crumb-sized nibble
of the cookie.
“Oh, come on, more than that!”
Anna snorted, grinning at him.
He took a deep breath and bit
the cookie in earnest, noisily
masticating with a sustained wince.
Anna gave his hand a squeeze.
“And now we get to wait for the
sunset.”
An indeterminate amount of time
later, Albert was leaning sti y

against the rock face, doing
everything in his power to keep
Anna from discovering that he was
in a state of unfocused mortal
terror.
“Wow, this—this is so weird. Is it
supposed to be like this?” he said,
trying to sound nonchalant but
feeling like something had gone
horribly wrong with his swallowing
re ex. Can throat muscles just shut
down? Is that a thing? Like, some sort
of instant throat atrophy? I won’t ever
be able to eat solid foods again. I’ll
have to pour lique ed food and water
down my throat. But wait—how do I
make sure it goes into my esophagus

and not into my trachea? I could
drown. Oh, my God, I’m gonna die by
drowning! Wait, no, I could build a
special funnel. Like a throat funnel.
To guide the liquid food down the
right tube. Edward would help me
with that. I’ll ask Edward. We’ll make
a funnel, Edward and I. With a
funnel, I can live.
Anna was too perceptive to be
fooled by his casual tone. She knew
he was having a private freak-out
and couldn’t help but laugh. “Oh,
my God, Albert, will you relax and
enjoy the buzz?”
“I—you gave me the right
amount, right? You don’t think I

took too much?”
“Jesus, I’m sorry I even
suggested it! I thought it’d help you
mellow out.”
“You don’t think something went
wrong, right? Like … I’m not
gonna stay this way, am I?”
“You’re fine, just ride it out.”
“But, like, you know other
people who’ve tried that cookie,
right? I mean, not that cookie, but
one like it? Like, a sister cookie?
And they’re ne, right? They’re still
alive?”
A prairie dog popped its head up
out of the ground nearby, and
Albert’s panic level quadrupled.

“ O h , shit! Anna, he knows! He
knows all about this!” Albert
sprinted away, leaving Anna
doubled over with teary-eyed
laughter.
CRACK!
The Wells Fargo stagecoach came
to a skull-rattling halt.
“Oh, shit,” the driver cursed. He
handed the reins to the shotgun
guard and stepped down o the
seat. When he surveyed the
damage, he knew they were going
to be here awhile.
The Sherman Creek Trail was

known for being relatively mild:
smooth,
at ground, no steep
inclines, and a more or less straight
as-the-crow- ies shot from point A
to point B. Thus, it was a logical
route for the Wells Fargo Bank to
use in transporting its gold
shipments, particularly because the
terrain was relatively open almost
the entire length of the trail. That
meant very few places for outlaws
to
conveniently
ambush the
shipments. The only exception was
the Copper Corridor, a half-milelong stretch of the trail that wound
through and around a series of
large natural rock formations,

e ectively
blocking
visibility
beyond thirty feet at every point
along the way.
The stagecoach had broken down
at the center of the corridor.
The driver furrowed his brow as
he looked down at the deep rut
that had caused the wheel to snap
o . “John, this hole’s been freshly
dug,” he said with deep concern on
his face.
The shotgun guard knew as well
as he did what that meant. “Bad
news,” he said softly, tightening his
grip on his Winchester ri e. “Look
sharp.”
Although the primary purpose of

the Wells Fargo stagecoach was to
deliver gold to its various branches
throughout the territory, it was
common for the company to
piggyback passenger transport
during such journeys as well. Thus,
a well-dressed family of three—
father, mother, and seven-year-old
son—waited patiently inside the
coach while the two men assessed
the seriousness of the breakage.
After a few moments, the driver
opened the carriage door and
addressed the man inside. “I’m very
sorry about this, sir, but we need
another body.”
The man sighed with mild

annoyance. “It’s all right.” He
climbed outside to assist them.
Realizing that he had a bit of
time to spare, the young boy
scrambled to follow his father.
“Don’t you go far, Michael,” his
mother said.
“I won’t, Mama. I’m gonna look
for lizards.”
The woman shuddered. “Don’t
you dare bring any of those awful
things in here.”
“I won’t, Mama, I promise.” He
scurried out the door and ran
across to the edge of the trail. It
felt good to run. They’d been
cooped up inside the carriage for

two days straight, and a young boy
couldn’t burn o all his excess
energy by
dgeting alone. He
scanned the area with sharp eyes,
eagerly anticipating the perennial
boyhood thrill of capturing a live
reptile. As luck would have it, he
didn’t have to look far. A tiny
lizard darted out from beneath a
rock and skittered up the trail. The
boy took o in pursuit. As he raced
after his quarry, the boy marveled
that the lizard’s tiny legs could
move with enough speed and
agility to make the chase an evenly
matched one.
The lizard darted out of sight

around one of the large monolithic
rock formations that lined the
edges of this part of the trail. The
boy raced around the corner after
it—
—and got the wind knocked out
of him. He lay on his back for a
moment, allowing his head to
clear. When he sat up, he found
himself staring at a group of four
rough-faced riders, led by the
coldest-looking man he had ever
seen.
The boy knew something of the
famous outlaws of the West from
reading stories and playing games
with his schoolmates, and, like any

boy his age, he was fascinated by
the glamorous, adventure- lled
lives they seemed to lead. In the
eyes of a seven-year-old, these
were heroes of a sort, possessing
colorful,
ribald,
charismatic
personalities that honey-coated
their dastardly acts, making them
entirely forgivable.
He could tell instantly that he
was looking at a real-life outlaw.
However, this man was nothing
like the rustlers, train robbers, and
gun ghters he’d read about. There
was no swashbuckling magnetism
here, only a frosty darkness that
emanated from eyes as reptilian as

the little lizard that had surely by
now made its escape. There was
something about this man that
struck a deep terror into the boy’s
heart.
The man knelt down to face the
boy. “Hello there, young fella,” he
said with a smile bereft of
kindness.
The boy sat frozen as the man
leaned closer and lightly patted his
knee, a sinister caricature of
paternal warmth.
“What are you doing out here?”
“I’m—I was … I was chasing a
lizard,”
he
said,
his
voice
quavering.

“Ah, I used to chase lizards when
I was your age. You catch him?”
“N-no, he—he got away.”
“Oh, that’s too bad. Are you out
here all alone?”
“My mom—my mommy and
daddy are here.”
“They are? Well, that’s a
comfort, isn’t it? The trail’s a
dangerous place for a little boy to
be roaming about all by himself.”
The man rose to his full height, his
sharply hooked brows lifting
slightly. “You know, I think I’d like
to meet your mommy and daddy.”
The

three

men

were

still

struggling to pull the ruined
carriage out of the rut when the
shot rang out. The driver, the
shotgun guard, and the welldressed man froze and looked up at
the sound. The woman, who rested
uncomfortably on a nearby rock,
ceased fanning herself and stared
with dread at the newcomers. A
group of four, all dangerouslooking, all armed. And their
weapons were aimed at the three
men. Her young son sat atop the
lead rider’s horse, stiff with fright.
Clinch aimed his gun at the head
of the shotgun guard. “Drop it,” he
instructed calmly. With reluctance,

the man slowly lowered his
Winchester to the ground.
The boy’s mother bolted to her
feet. “Michael!” she cried out.
“Oh, you needn’t worry about
your boy, ma’am,” Clinch said with
a tip of his hat. “He’s gonna be just
ne … provided you all do as
you’re told.” He nodded back to the
burly man who anked him on his
right. “Do the honors, Ben.”
Ben dismounted, strode over to
the wagon, and lifted up the top of
the driver’s seat, where the Wells
Fargo lockboxes were customarily
hidden. Sure enough, he pulled out
a medium-sized wooden box coated

in peeling green paint. “Got it,
Clinch!” he shouted excitedly. The
box was sealed with a large
padlock. Ben set the box down on
the ground and, with just a couple
of shots red, managed to break
open the lock. He lifted the lid.
“Sweet Jesus, will you look at
that,” he uttered with a wide-eyed
grin. He turned and presented it to
Clinch, displaying its glittering
contents.
Clinch’s reptilian eyes lit up like
a summer storm. “Ten thousand in
pure gold bullion,” he whispered
with quiet intensity.
All the outlaws were trans xed

by the rows of gold bars, which
screamed the promise of a future
gilded with creature comforts. Even
young Michael, despite his terror,
could not help but let a small gasp
escape his lips.
There will never be another
chance, the shotgun guard realized.
He very slowly lowered his hand
toward his boot, where he had
hidden a spare derringer for just
such an eventuality.
“Ten thousand, hell,” said Ben.
“There’s gotta be at least fteen
here!”
Clinch ran a dusty nger over
the bars. “We’ll kindly relieve the

Wells Fargo company of this heavy
burden.”
The guard quietly pulled the
pistol from his boot. The outlaws
were still focused greedily on the
contents of the lockbox. The lead
rider’s head was bent low over the
gold, which meant as clear a head
shot as there would ever be without
risk of killing the boy.
The guard pulled the trigger.
CRACK!
And suddenly his gun was on the
ground, as one of his ngers sailed
away behind him. The barrel of the
lead rider’s pistol was smoking.
The guard screamed in pain as he

clutched his crippled hand.
“That,” said Clinch, “was a
mistake.”
Clinch dismounted, leaving the
boy sitting alone atop the
disproportionately large horse. He
approached the stricken guard and
shoved him roughly against the
side of the carriage. “Listen to me
closely,” said Clinch with a deadly
soft tone as he pressed the cold
steel of his pistol against the other
man’s throat. “You’re very lucky.
Do you know that? Because I’ve
recently come into possession of
fteen thousand dollars in gold
bullion. Which means I’m in a good

mood today. Now, are you gonna
try that again?”
“N-no. No, sir,” squeaked the
petrified guard.
“You know that’d be stupid. Yes,
you know that, don’t you?”
“Y-yes.”
“Good, good. Because I’m gonna
give you just one warning: You
reach for that ri e again, and this
will happen.”
Clinch
red, destroying the
man’s throat. The guard slumped to
the ground, leaving a trail of blood
smeared down the side of the
carriage.
“Like I said—one warning.”

The members of Clinch’s gang
were still busy ogling the shiny
gold bars, so no one noticed until
Michael was already o the horse
and sprinting toward his mother’s
open arms. One of the outlaws
turned, spotted the boy halfway,
and raised his gun to shoot.
“Jordy, put your gun down!”
Clinch snapped. “He’s just a little
boy.” Clinch causally strode back
over to the gang, where he
promptly backhanded Jordy across
the mouth. The man collapsed into
the dirt, wiping his bleeding face.
“Now, let’s get one thing good and
clear before you all start feeling

too much of the gold fever,” Clinch
continued with a commanding
tone. “Nobody’s doing a goddamn
thing with this haul until it cools
down. We’ll head back to Old
Stump, pick up Lewis and Anna,
and then lay low for at least a
month. Understood?”
The boys grunted a chorus of
affirmatives.
And so Clinch’s gang rode away,
leaving behind a wrecked carriage,
its helpless driver, a traumatized
family, and a bloody corpse.
The barn was far and away the
largest in Old Stump—too large, in

fact, for the farm it belonged to.
Chester Cooksey had once owned
vast amounts of adjacent farmland,
until a particularly bad harvest
season had forced him to sell o a
large chunk of it in order to make
ends meet. As a result, he was left
with a lot of unused barn space. So,
partly to help out a local citizen
but mostly because it was the
perfect location, the town of Old
Stump tossed Chester a modest
amount of compensation each year
to allow the use of the barn for the
annual dance. It was, Albert had
noted many times, a great
opportunity to once a year put on

uncomfortable clothes and cram
yourself into an enclosed space
with all the people you see every
single day.
And he
and Anna
were
uncomfortably dressed indeed on
that hot-as-hell, dry-as-fuck Friday
evening as they strode through the
entryway
into
the
festively
decorated barn. Colorful streamers
hung from the rafters, lanterns
were strewn here and there along
the ceiling framework, and … well,
that was about it. Great job,
decorating committee. Way to reach
for the stars, he thought as he
shifted awkwardly in his itchy wool

three-piece Sunday best. But, as
miserable as he was, Anna
appeared even more so. The dress
she wore was the fashion of the
day and looked as if it had been
created by an apparel designer
with an advanced brain tumor. It
was hard to tell which layer was
which, there were more bows than
a rich kid’s wrapped Christmas gift,
and the bustle on the rear stuck out
almost four and a half feet.
“Well, this’ll be fun,” she
deadpanned. “It’s nice to put on
some loose, comfortable clothes
and just relax, y’know?”
“Yeah, I love formal frontier

dress,”
muttered
Albert. “How
many foot undergarments are you
wearing?”
“Let’s see, I’ve got two pairs of
wool calf pantaloons, three pairs of
Dutch socks, a set of bear-hide foot
mittens, and a brace of woodbutton overshoes. You?”
“Uh, I’ve got four pairs of Dutch
socks, one set of sealskin ankle
moccasins, two layers of Klondike
heel o cers, and a blanket-lined
oilcloth foot coat.”
“I’m really comfortable,” she
said, adjusting layer number 47.
“Me too. I’m glad I remembered
the six items I somehow require to

hold up my pants.”
He turned his attention to her
rear end. “I like your bustle, by the
way.”
“Thanks,” Anna said. “Yeah, I
love that the most alluring fashion
statement a woman can make
today is to simulate a fat ass.”
“If I was a black guy, that’s the
meanest trick you could play on
me.”
“Especially ’cause, when you lift
it up, it’s just a big metal cage.”
She raised the back of her dress to
reveal the bustle’s support system:
a complex curved iron framework
that resembled a warship under

construction.
“Look at that,” said Albert. “You
are ready to relieve the stress of
the day.”
“Completely.”
Albert sighed and surveyed the
crowded room. Despite the heat,
everyone was dancing gaily, and
looking as though they had no
cares or concerns in the world.
Albert himself
was not so
fortunate.
His
dreaded
confrontation with Foy loomed
roughly twelve hours away, and
although he had made signi cant
strides in his marksmanship under
Anna’s adept tutelage, the outcome

was still far from a lock. Over the
past few days, he had even begun
to wonder whether the potentially
mortal price of the risk o set the
gain. A week ago, such a thought
would not even have occurred to
him. He loved Louise with all his
heart, but he was noticing tiny
cracks in his resolve, and he did
not understand why. His stomach
still corkscrewed whenever he laid
eyes on her, but it was now almost
like a re ex: a whack on the funny
bone. It was also a bit more
eeting in duration. There were
even points during the day when
his mind was elsewhere. There was

no question that the thought of
being without her was still
abhorrent, but that feeling now
presented itself in a slightly
more … habitual way.
He shook o his thoughts. They
were irrelevant. The gun ght was
tomorrow, and there was no
backing out now, lest he be
branded even more of a coward.
And why should he want to back
out anyway? Louise was worth
risking his life. She was his soul
mate.
Wasn’t she?
“Well, this’ll be a fun way to
spend my last night alive,” he said

wryly.
“Hey,” she said, “you’re gonna
be okay tomorrow. You’ve come a
long way since the fair.”
He wiped a sheen of sweat o
his brow. “Why the hell does
everything in the West always have
to be settled with violence
anyway? This is the ’80s, for
Christ’s sake. Let’s be civilized.”
Anna turned to face him and
took both his hands in hers. They
were surprisingly cool against the
extreme heat of the room, and they
felt good. “Do you trust me?” she
said.
Again he had the nagging

awareness that he knew very little
about this woman, but when he
stared into those con dent hazel
eyes, he felt that somehow it didn’t
matter. He could trust her. “Yeah. I
do.”
Anna pushed away a strand of
hair that was hanging over her left
eye.
One of her eyes is a lighter hazel
than the other, he observed. He had
been with her every day for the
past week. How had he not noticed
that until now?
“Good.” She smiled warmly,
squeezing his hands. “If I thought
you were gonna lose this gun ght,

I’d make you call it o .
Understand?”
He believed her. “Yeah. Okay.”
She really is very—
His thoughts were interrupted by
Edward’s shouting. “Hey! Albert!
Anna! Hi!” He and Ruth came
bounding over to where they were
standing.
Anna gently let go of Albert’s
hands.
“They’re
gonna
start
the
sweethearts’ dance pretty soon,”
Edward
announced
with
excitement. “You guys wanna join?
Oh, and how great is this band,
huh?”

“Yeah, they’re fantastic,” Albert
said drily. He cupped a hand to his
mouth and shouted at the stage, “I
just wanna point out that all your
instruments were made for another
purpose!”
The jolly group of musicians
playing the washtub bass, the jug,
the spoons, the comb, the saw, the
dirt-shovel guitar, and the pie-plate
banjo either did not hear him or
chose to ignore the comment.
“Okay, let’s all line up for the
sweethearts’ dance!” shouted the
burly,
red-faced
master
of
ceremonies.
Anna did not waste any time as

she grabbed Albert’s arm and
yanked him toward the dance
floor. “Come on!” she said eagerly.
“Oh, Jesus, no, I suck at
dancing.”
“No one’ll notice; you suck at
everything.” She gave him a
playful wink and dragged him onto
the dance oor with surprising
strength.
Her enthusiasm was infectious
and managed to partially cut
through
Albert’s
layers
of
n ega tivity. He felt helpless to
prevent the trace of a smile that
crept across his face.
The smile evaporated as he saw

Foy and Louise also step onto the
dance oor, dressed to the nines
and holding hands.
Foy spotted Albert immediately.
“Well, hello there, sheepie.”
Albert sti ened. “Hello, Foy.
Louise.”
“Hi, Albert,” Louise said flatly.
She looked beautiful in a lightblue evening dress with creamcolored lace trim. But something
was missing. No matter what she
wore, from frilly formal attire to
everyday outdoor clothing, she
always had a glow about her. That
glow was absent tonight. Albert
realized with a jolt that this was

the rst time since he’d met her
that it was not present. Was
something wrong with her?
“Tomorrow’s a big day, isn’t it?”
Foy smirked cockily. “Care for a
last dance?”
Albert was confused. “With you?”
“No.”
“Oh, you mean—yeah, no, we’re
gonna dance. Anna and me.”
The burly master of ceremonies
spoke again. “And now to serenade
us for the sweethearts’ dance, our
very own Marcus Thornton!”
The owner of Old Stump’s livery
stables stepped into the glow of the
kerosene footlights, his bushy

moustache and wild hair making
him instantly recognizable from
afar. Marcus was well known
throughout the town as a goldenvoiced lothario, and the ladies in
the room perked up as the band
played him on with a jaunty intro.
“Ready for terrible, weird, sti ,
traditional
frontier
dancing?”
Albert said as he and Anna took
their place among the other
couples.
“Thank you, friends!” Marcus
Thornton called out cheerily from
the stage. “And now I’d like to
serenade you with a lively tune by
the great Stephen Foster! This is a

request tonight from my friend and
yours, Mr. Foy Ellison!”
Foy ashed Albert a grin that
looked as though he’d rented a
couple dozen extra teeth just for
the occasion, as Marcus Thornton
began bellowing the song in his
deep, operatic baritone:
You men who are looking for love
Don’t ever give up in despair
For I’ll tell you a secret I know
To capture the hearts of the fair
Now, maybe you haven’t the looks
Or maybe you haven’t the dash
But you’ll win any girl anywhere
If you’ve only got a moustache!

A moustache! A moustache!
If you’ve only got a moustache!
You may be the lowest of low
With nary a glimmer of pride
But you needn’t be born of a king
To make any maiden a bride
No matter you haven’t the name
No matter you haven’t the cash
You can make any woman your
own
If you’ve only got a moustache!
A moustache! A moustache!
If you’ve only got a moustache!
You may be as fat as a bull
You may be as ugly as sin

The ladies are shutting you out
You’re wondering how to get in
Well, here is a piece of advice
For making a hell of a splash
You can turn every head at the
ball
If you’ve only got a moustache!
A moustache! A moustache!
If you’ve only got a moustache!
A moustache! A moustache!
Big moustache! Thick moustache!
My moustache! Your moustache!
How I love the word moustache!
A moustache! A moustache!
If you’ve only got a moustache!

“God,” said Albert. “I hate it
here.”
Anna
whispered
to
him
conspiratorially, “Hey, what do
you say I steal a bottle of whiskey
and we hit the road?”
Albert’s shoulders slumped with
relief. “I love that idea.”
She smiled and strode briskly
across the room to the bar. “Your
dick’s out,” she said to the
bartender. He glanced down with
alarm, at which point she grabbed
a bottle from the countertop, along
with two glasses. When he looked
up, both woman and bottle were
gone. Anna had never even broken

stride.
But rather than heading back to
Albert, she stopped at an empty
table in the corner of the barn. She
set both glasses on the table and
quickly glanced over each shoulder.
When she was satis ed no one was
watching, she subtly removed a
paper pouch from her sleeve. She
emptied its contents—a small
quantity of white powder—into
one of the glasses. She tossed away
the paper and scanned the room.
Foy and Louise were seated ve
tables over. Anna made her move.
“Hi,” she said as she approached
them.
Foy looked up, bristling

visibly when he saw who it was.
“Listen, Albert and I are gonna
split,” she continued, “but I just
wanted to wish you good luck for
tomorrow.”
“Thank you.” He smiled coldly.
“You’re welcome,” she countered
with warmth. “So … I guess it’s
weird knowing that a woman can
outshoot you, huh?”
Foy leaned back, folding his
arms. “If you don’t mind, my
girlfriend and I are enjoying each
other’s company.”
She plowed ahead. “But you
know what the real kicker is? I can
outdrink you too.”

Foy relaxed a bit, and she saw
his con dence bubble up again.
“That, I can assure you, is
impossible.”
Anna ashed a mischievous smile
as she held up the bottle and
glasses, carefully obscuring the
white powder with her hand.
Without another word, she lled
both glasses two thirds of the way
and handed the tainted one to Foy.
She raised her glass to him. “Ten
cents to the winner.”
He raised his glass in response.
“Agreed.”
“One … two … three.” They
pounded the whiskey like a pair of

pros. But Foy
nished
rst,
slamming his glass down onto the
table, victorious. Anna swallowed
her last gulp and coughed as she
set her empty down next to his. She
frowned at it with a perfectly
simulated air of abashment. “Shit,”
she muttered softly, but with
enough volume to reach Foy’s ears.
“Don’t feel bad,” he said with an
ugly little smirk. “Alcohol doesn’t
harmonize well with a woman’s
frail constitution.”
“Guess not,” she responded
matter-of-factly, tossing the coins
onto the table in front of him.
“Here you go. You can buy your

girlfriend a brain.”
“Excuse me?” Louise straightened
defensively.
For the rst time during the
exchange, Anna dropped her
controlled façade. “You’re an idiot.
You have the nicest guy in the
world throwing himself at your
feet, and you’re here with this
complete asshole.”
“Who I go out with is my own
business,” Louise said curtly. “So
why don’t you mind your own,
bitch?”
Anna shook her head in
wonderment. “You know,” she
said, “you have very lovely, very

big blue eyes. No one would ever
know you were blind.” Anna
whirled around and strode away,
her bustle swaying back and forth
as it vanished into the crowd.
Although nearly every member
of the population of Old Stump had
gathered to participate in the
dance
that
night,
the
one
individual who was forced to
abstain, thanks to the very nature
of his profession, was Sheri
Arness. He stood sullenly at the
potbelly stove across from his desk,
slowly stirring a watery stew of
beef and vegetables for his dinner.

His wife had been trampled by
cattle three years ago, and since
then Millie the brothel madam had
gotten into the habit of bringing
him his meals as a sort of uno cial
courtesy. Whether it was out of
pity for his loss, or whether she had
romantic designs of her own, no
one knew—not even the sheri —
but he was nonetheless grateful for
the kindness.
Tonight, however, Millie was
whooping it up at the barn dance
along with the rest of the town, so
it fell to Sheri Arness to cook his
own dinner. To make the task even
more disagreeable, he had to

prepare enough for his prisoner.
Seems downright stupid to waste good
beef on a dead man, he thought
bitterly. Lewis Barnes was being
held for shooting the pastor’s son
until a U.S. marshal could be
dispatched to Old Stump to take
him into custody. Lewis would get
a trial, of course, but because of
Pastor Wilson’s blood connection to
a congressman, that trial would be
primarily for show. Lewis Barnes
would be executed before the
month was out.
The sheri ladled three spoonfuls
of stew onto his own plate and
then a single spoonful on a plate

for Lewis. He spat a mucus- lled
glob of saliva on top for good
measure, then retrieved the cell key
from his desk. Lewis was fast
asleep on his cot against the far
wall. Plate in hand, the sheri
cautiously unlocked the cell door.
As soon as it was open, he pulled
his gun out of its holster and aimed
it at the slumbering prisoner.
“Suppertime, you lazy prick,” he
growled.
Lewis remained unconscious, his
soft, rhythmic snores echoing o
the walls of the sparse cell.
The sheri slowly set the plate
down on the oor. He straightened

up again and stared at the sleeping
man with distaste. “Goddamn
waste of lungs.” He turned back
toward the cell door—
—and was out cold before he
even felt the blow.
It was as mild a night as the
desert ever deigned to o er its
human tenants, and the stars were
out in theatrical plenitude. Albert
and Anna sat on the uneven fence
next to Albert’s farmhouse and
swapped jolting pulls from the
whiskey bottle.
Albert took a swallow and
winced as the burning amber liquid

blazed a trail from his throat down
to his stomach. He shook o the
intensity of the taste with a highfrequency shiver and turned to
Anna.
“I have that goddamn
moustache song stuck in my head,”
he complained.
“Just think of another song,” she
suggested.
“I can’t; there’s only like three
songs.”
“That’s true, and they’re all by
Stephen Foster.”
“Ugh, yeah.” Albert grimaced.
“You don’t like his music?”
“I dunno, I’m … on the fence
about it.”

Anna rolled her eyes at his pun.
“Wow, now I hope you get shot
tomorrow.”
Albert laughed and looked at her
fondly. “Listen,” he said with
sincerity,
“whatever
happens
tomorrow … I just wanna say
thank you. And y’know, this may
be the booze, or your pep talk
earlier, or both, but … I think I can
do it. I can beat him.”
Anna gave his arm a squeeze as
she took another swig of whiskey.
“Like I said, you’ll be ne. And in
case you haven’t noticed, you
sound a lot more con dent than
that guy who pulled me out of the

saloon not too long ago.”
Albert thought back to that night.
It seemed like a year ago. In
reality, it had been … what, two
weeks? Not even. He felt as though
he’d known Anna Barnes so much
longer. He could trust her. And yet,
paradoxically …
“Anna, I have to ask you
something. I feel as close to you as
any friend I’ve ever had. Which is
fucked up, because the glaring fact
is, I still don’t really know anything
about you. And every time I ask,
you change the subject.”
Anna sighed and lowered her
head. Usually, her acute mind

would quickly arm her with a
sharp, con dent response to any
question, but this time she did not
speak.
Albert got the distinct sense that
he was about to get the real story.
In a way, he did.
“I know it seems like I’ve been
secretive with you,” she said,
“and … look, to be honest, here’s
how it is: I don’t much like where I
come from. I don’t like it at all. It’s
a rotten place, and as far as I’m
concerned, I’d just as soon erase it
from my life. And it’s not who I am
today. I know it’s asking a lot,
but … don’t ask me about it.

Okay?”
Albert’s curiosity was now twice
as piqued; he desperately wanted
to pry deeper. Instead, he o ered
his best sympathetic smile. “Okay.”
“Thanks,” she said with visible
relief. The playfulness immediately
returned to her tone. “Now, how
’bout a toast to something we both
have in common: our hatred of this
terrible part of the country.” She
raised the whiskey bottle. “Fuck the
West!” She took a sizable pull and
passed it to Albert.
“Fuck the West!” he echoed, and
tossed back a swig of his own.
There were only a couple more

shots left in the bottle. “If you want
to kill it, go ahead,” she offered.
“No, I can’t,” he said. “I’ve had
enough already, and when I drink
too much, it doesn’t shit well.”
“Doesn’t sit well.” She laughed,
raising the bottle to her lips.
“No, shit. It causes horrible shits.
The morning after I drink too
much, when I sit down to go to the
bathroom, it feels like a madman
trying to punch his way out of my
asshole.”
Anna laughed so hard, the
whiskey came squirting out of her
nostrils.
“See, that’s what happens, right

there,” Albert said, laughing along
with her. “I need at least half the
Old Testament in the john with me,
that’s how long it takes. Ironically,
it usually settles down by the time I
get to the part in Leviticus where it
says, No butt stuff.”
“Okay, stop! You’re gonna make
me drown!” She coughed, shoving
him coltishly.
Albert straightened. “Ooh, I
almost forgot,” he said with
excitement. He called toward the
corral. “Bridget! Come here,
Bridget! Baaaa! Baaaa!”
Bridget emerged from the ock
of sheep and hurried over toward

the fence, bleating back at Albert.
She had something strapped to her
back, Anna noticed. As Bridget
came to a stop next to the fence,
Anna saw that it was a wooden
tray with a small wrapped gift
sitting on top.
“What’s this?” she asked with
amusement.
“Ah, it’s not much. Just a little
something to say thanks.”
She looked at Albert with
suspicious but a ectionate eyes
and carefully unwrapped the
paper. Inside, she found a picture
frame with a photograph in it. It
was a young, scru y-looking

cowboy leaning against a barn—
—with a big grin on his face.
Her eyes snapped wide open.
“Holy shit!!”
“I know, right?!” Albert said
giddily.
“He’s smiling! In the picture!”
“I know! I bought it o a peddler
who was coming through town a
few days ago.”
“This is the guy I heard about! I
can’t even believe this exists!”
“Yeah, and apparently he’s not
insane.”
“Bullshit.”
“That’s what the guy told me.”
“It takes thirty seconds to take a

photograph. He would’ve had to
smile for thirty sustained seconds.”
“I know. I’ve never been happy
for thirty seconds in a row in my
life.”
“It’s the West—no one has. He’s
gotta be insane.”
“Yeah, probably.”
She turned to him with a look of
enormous gratitude. “Albert, this
was really kind of you.”
“Oh, please, I owe you. A lot
more than this, actually.”
She kissed him on the cheek. Her
touch was warm, and her scent was
a fragrant sweetness that stood in
glaring incongruity with the

malodorous
stink
of
the
surrounding frontier.
Albert kissed her.
She did not pull away. For
several
moments,
they
both
allowed the world around them to
melt into nonexistence.
When the kiss ended, Albert was
acutely aware that his cheeks were
bright red. He felt stimulated,
alive, and supremely confused. He
opened his mouth to speak, with no
clue as to what was going to come
out. “Oh,” he said.
She
looked at
him
with
seemingly new eyes. “What?” she
said softly.

“I’m … I’m sorry. I shouldn’t
have done that.”
“It’s okay.”
“I—you’ve just … you’ve been a
good friend to me, that’s all.”
“It’s really okay,” she said,
putting a gentle hand on his.
“Plus, I’ve had a shitload of
whiskey.”
She laughed. “Me too. I know,
it’s
ne. I should probably go
anyway.”
Albert
looked
down
selfconsciously at his shoes. “I’ll take
you home.”
The desert night had chilled

somewhat as they walked side by
side up to the door of the Old
Stump Hotel. They paused in the
entryway.
“Good luck tomorrow,” she said
with warm reassurance. “I’ll be
there.”
“Thanks,” he said. They stood
there under the lamplight for what
seemed like an eternity, and then
she kissed him back.
Where their rst encounter had
been sweet, gentle, and delicate,
this one was passionate. He
returned it in kind. What the hell am
I doing? he thought. I’m about to risk
my life to win back the woman I love.

I love Louise.
But he stayed.
For several minutes they allowed
the moment to take its own shape
as they held each other, relishing
the shared body heat that warmed
them in the brisk air.
Then at last Albert stepped back
and released his hands from hers.
He could feel his smile touching his
eyes, something he had not felt in a
conspicuously long time. “Good
night,” he said, and turned to walk
away. He strode o toward the
hitching post as Anna closed the
hotel door behind her.
Neither of them noticed the

murky gure of Lewis watching
from the shadows of the alley
across the street.
“You can’t call it o ?” Louise
asked Foy, making a swirling
motion against his bare chest with
her pale, petite finger.
“Of course not!” he said sharply.
“I’d be branded a coward.”
“But, baby, if you ght him
tomorrow, you’re gonna kill him.”
“Yes, that’s what happens in a
gun ght,”
he
said
with
condescension.
They lay side by side in Foy’s
generously proportioned brass bed.

His home was easily the most well
appointed in Old Stump and the
only house that contained any
polished wood.
“Look, he’s not a bad guy, Foy. I
mean, yeah, he’s kind of a loser
and he always smells like sheep,
but he doesn’t deserve to be shot.”
“Louise, my decision is
nal.
Now do it.”
She pouted. “But I’m tired.”
“Louise,” he said sternly. She
sighed, leaned in toward his face,
and began to dutifully suck on one
tip of his moustache.
He closed his eyes as he shifted
his body in arousal. “Mmm …” he

moaned, his brow moist and his
lips parted. “My social stature is
signi cant. I’m an important man.
I have my own business. People
envy me.” Then suddenly his eyes
snapped open. He sat up rigidly,
leapt out of bed, and dashed out of
the room.
“Foy?” Louise called after him.
“What’s wrong? Foy?”
She heard him race out the front
door. She opened the window and
looked out. It was dark, but she
could make out his bare-assed
naked form sprinting across the
yard to the outhouse. He slammed
the wooden door with the crescent

moon carved in its surface and
swore loudly as explosive diarrhea
claimed him for the next half hour.
The morning of the gun ght was
bright and clear, the air mild. Anna
brushed her hair in preparation as
she stared at herself in the hotel
room’s full-length mirror. She had
more on her mind than she cared to
contend with, as she had not
expected events to play out the
way they had. Albert had been a
project: a fun sort of diversion
while she bided her time in the
sleepy town of Old Stump, pending
the inevitable return of Clinch.

Albert had been a toy, one she’d
become extremely fond of. But now
things
had
changed. She had
changed.
Anna wasn’t worried about the
gun ght. Albert would be ne. He
would never be a crack shot, of
course, but he wouldn’t need to be.
Foy would be too sick to hold a
gun, let alone shoot straight,
assuming he showed up at all. But
s h e was worried about herself.
What had happened could not be
undone. And yet how could it be
faced, given what her life was?
Her thoughts were interrupted by
a knock at the door. She set her

hairbrush down on the side table
and went to answer it. It was
probably Albert, wanting a lastminute pep talk before he went out
to confront his opponent. But when
she opened the door, the eyes that
greeted her were cold and
reptilian.
“Hi, sweetheart,” said Clinch.
Albert stood at one end of the
thoroughfare, overcome by déjà vu.
This was precisely where he’d stood
not so long ago as he prepared to
face o against Charlie Blanche.
The crowd lined both edges of the
thoroughfare, just as they had for

every gun ght since Old Stump’s
birth. Edward and Ruth gave Albert
supportive looks as they watched
from one side of the street,
squeezing each other’s hands. And
there, looking on from the rows of
assembled townsfolk, in almost the
exact same spot she’d occupied on
the day of the Charlie Blanche
encounter, was Louise. On that day
she’d been part of his life—an
extension of himself that he’d
considered as constant as the
seasons, as vital as a limb.
And now? She was somebody
else’s constant. But as much as that
hurt, it was a very di erent strain

of hurt than it had been before. It
cut deep, to be sure, but the pain
was dull, the wound scabbing.
With Charlie Blanche, Albert had
faced an opponent who was sharp,
tough, and ready for action.
However, the man who stumbled
into position at the other end of the
street today looked ready for
nothing short of the grave. The
crowd murmured with uncertainty
as Foy shu ed out into the street,
looking sweaty and sunken-eyed.
Nonetheless, he managed to muster
up a passably cocky grin. “Well,
now. I didn’t think you’d show,
sheepie.”

Albert sized him up as he tried to
determine exactly what was
happening with the man. It didn’t
matter, he supposed. “Um, yeah,”
he said. “Listen, Foy, you—”
Albert was cut short by a sharp
hand gesture with clear meaning:
Dear God, hold on a second. Foy
clutched his stomach in obvious
pain and staggered over to the
edge of the street, grasping the top
of a hitching post to steady himself.
Suddenly his eyes widened as a
look of panic crossed his face. One
arm reached out feebly for a black
bowler hat sitting atop the head of
a very surprised-looking bearded

man observing from the street’s
periphery. Foy snatched the hat o
the man’s head, threw it on the
ground with the inside facing
upward, yanked down his trousers,
and squatted on top of it. A blast of
diarrhea issued forth with the
pressure of a burst steam engine,
completely
lling the hat. Foy
straightened and started to pull up
his trousers in a pitiful attempt to
salvage some measure of dignity.
But before he could get the trousers
to his waistline, a second wave
overtook him. He turned to the
opposite side of the thoroughfare
and reached accidly for another

man’s hat. The second man
inched and backed away, having
no desire to submit his hat to the
fate that would surely befall it
should he relinquish possession.
Foy persisted, matching the man’s
retreat with weak, stumbling
advances. With a nal burst of
energy, Foy’s arm struck out and
seized the hat, throwing it to the
ground as before. He unloaded a
second shipment of watery shit.
Albert watched uncomfortably as
Foy stood up, winded and
wheezing. Foy refastened his
trousers (Albert did not want to
think about the conspicuous

absence of post-evacuant hygiene)
and took his position once again.
“All … all done?” asked Albert.
“I’m ready,” Foy
croaked,
looking far from done.
Albert nodded, put both hands on
his gun belt …
… and unclasped it, letting his
gun fall to the ground.
Foy stared at him, utterly ba ed
despite his condition. The crowd
murmured with confusion.
“Foy,” said Albert, a tone of
uncharacteristic con dence in his
voice, “she’s all yours.”
The crowd’s murmuring rose as
they struggled to assimilate this

unusual development. They didn’t
have to wait long for an
explanation, as Albert turned to
face the woman who had driven
him to this place on this day.
“Louise,”
he
said,
“you
are … God, you are so beautiful.
And I really do care about you.
But … I don’t know—I think
somewhere along the line I forgot
that a relationship is a two-way
street. And I’ve been reminded
recently of what it’s like to have
someone care about me. And you
know what? I like it. So if you
wanna spend the rest of your life
with a pussy full of hair, I say go

with God and best of luck to you.”
Albert gave her a gentlemanly
tip of the hat and strode away from
the thoroughfare with a lightness
and an optimism that he had not
felt in a very long time. After a
moment, however, he turned
around to face the crowd again.
“I just realized, that joke may
not have been clear. I didn’t mean
that she has a hairy pussy; I meant
that Foy has a moustache, so … she
gets hair in her … when he … goes
down there. Yeah.” He smiled
gamely and walked away once
more.
One cowboy in the crowd spoke

up. “I got it.”
Albert practically sprinted up the
steps of the hotel. Maybe Anna was
watching from her room, he thought,
knowing full well that was absurd.
She should have been there to
support him. Regardless, whatever
her reason for being absent, he
knew he would forgive her. He felt
too good today. Too intoxicated
with liberation.
In fact, he realized that he had
become accustomed to waking up
every morning feeling like shit.
There was a normalcy to it that
had taken up residence in his body

and soul. As he took the stairs two
at a time, he thought, I feel great. Is
this what I’ve been missing out on?
How could I have spent so much of
my life being denied this feeling?
He reached Anna’s room at the
top of the stairs and banged
excitedly on the door.
“Anna!”
There was no answer.
Albert knocked again and then
tried the knob. It was unlocked,
and he poked his head inside and
looked around. The bed was
unmade. A full washbasin sat on
the side table. A hairbrush lay on
the floor. But the room was empty.

“Hey, guys, have you seen
Anna?” Albert asked as he pu ed
up the street toward Ruth and
Edward. The rest of the crowd had
more or less dispersed, grumbling
to themselves with dissatisfaction
over the lack of bloodshed.
“No,” said Ruth. “Not since last
night at the dance.”
“Huh,” he said, at a complete
loss.
“Albert … it’s her, isn’t it?”
Albert smiled. “Yeah. It’s her.”
“You love her.”
“Yeah. I do. And what’s even
better is, I think she might love me
back.”

Edward grinned. “Oh, that is so
great. I think she’s so neat.”
“So nobody’s seen her, huh?”
Albert was now beginning to
worry. “I don’t understand. She
said she’d be there this morning.
She wouldn’t just not show up.”
Ruth patted his arm. “I’m sure
she’s fine, Albert. And she’ll turn up
soon. Especially if what you said is
true.”
“Yeah, I guess so.… ”
“Hey, in the meantime, why
don’t we all get outta this heat and
go have a beer, huh?” Edward
suggested.
They made their way into the

saloon, ordered three glasses of
beer, and sat down at their usual
corner table.
“Hey, um, Albert?” said Edward
with an awkward expression on his
face.
“Yeah?”
“Do you think you and Anna will
have sex?”
Albert was caught o
guard.
“I … I dunno. I mean … maybe at
some point.”
“Well, when you do, how about
let’s make it like an all-us-friends
thing. Like, we all get, like, in
sync. Sexually.”
“Eddie, we’re not having sex,”

Ruth said flatly.
Edward hung his head in shame.
“I’m sorry, I know, it was a stupid
idea.”
“Ruth! Let’s fuck!” shouted the
dirty cowboy from the stairwell.
“Coming!” She hurried o to do
her job.
“She keeps my head on straight,”
said Edward gratefully.
Albert was about to question
that, when they heard the sound of
approaching hooves outside. The
saloon was fairly packed with
townsfolk who had dragged their
asses all the way from home to
watch a gun ght that hadn’t

occurred, and they’d now turned
their attention to drinking and
gambling, for lack of anything
better to do. They all looked up as
two perspiring local farmers
hurried into the saloon, wearing
expressions of abject terror.
The hoofbeats came to a halt just
outside. Albert and Edward heard
the sound of spur-heeled boots
ascending the wooden steps. The
batwing doors opened …
… and in stepped the biggest,
most sinister-looking man Albert
had ever seen. He was cold-eyed,
dead-faced,
and
all
too
recognizable from the posters in

the sheriff’s office.
“Clinch Leatherwood,” Edward
said with horror, almost too softly
to be heard.
Albert rolled his eyes in dismay.
“Great. Another thing that can kill
us. We should all just wear co ns
as clothes.”
Clinch Leatherwood brought with
him a dark, bloody history, even
prior to his emergence as a
notoriously deadly threat to peace,
law, and order on the frontier. He
was born in South Carolina in
1836, the son of a poorly
compensated
overseer
on
a
struggling rice plantation. His

mother had died the day she gave
birth to him—not as a result of the
birth itself, but because a heavy
summer rain had caused the roof to
collapse immediately following the
delivery, crushing her beyond
recognition. Miraculously (or not,
depending on one’s point of view),
Clinch
had
survived.
His
relationship with his father had, by
adolescence, decayed to the ugly
degree that outbreaks of physical
violence between father and son
were not uncommon. Inevitably, it
escalated to such intensity that one
night, after a particularly heated
argument about which of them

disliked Mexicans more, Clinch
broke a whiskey bottle in half and
stabbed his father in the throat
with the sharp end. Having no
intention of being tried for murder,
the younger Leatherwood ed the
scene and roamed aimlessly
throughout the South for several
years, successfully avoiding blame
for the patricide.
Then, as luck would have it, the
outbreak of the Civil War provided
him with an appropriate conductor
for his electric temper. Clinch
enlisted in the Confederate Army,
where he wound up as part of a
regiment stationed in northern

Virginia, not far from Union lines.
However, long stretches of inaction
coupled with a shortage of supplies
soon brought his barely controlled
rage bubbling back to the surface.
A quarrel erupted one night
between Clinch and a fellow
noncommissioned o cer over a
chunk of ham. The ham had been
sent to the noncom as part of a
care package from his family.
Clinch wanted the ham for himself,
but rather than ask the noncom if
he would be willing to share it,
Clinch attacked the man in his tent
and beat him to death, using the
ham as a blunt instrument. This

time, however, there was no
escaping awareness of his crime. It
was a small camp, and there were
witnesses who would testify to
seeing Clinch emerging from the
tent holding the bloody ham. Once
again, Clinch ed. He made his
way west, west, and farther west,
until he reached the southern
Arizona territory. Here, there was
barely any law at all. Here, the
toughest men forged the moral
compass with their whims. This
was where he belonged. And he
had ourished, cutting a swath of
terror and death through the
region, creating a name for himself

that struck fear into the hearts of
everyone who heard it.
Clinch scanned the saloon. He
took a few steps into the room.
Three other rough-looking men
followed, anking him on either
side. All were armed to the teeth,
with two pistols apiece and fully
loaded gun belts.
Everyone held their breath. Then
nally, after several seconds of
silent scrutiny, Clinch spoke in a
low, deadly tone.
“Someone in this little shit-box
town is gonna die. One of my boys
saw a man kissing my wife last
night. I want to know who it was.”

Edward whistled softly. “Jesus.”
Albert nodded. “Yeah, no shit.
Someone’s gonna get fuuuucked
uuuuup.”
Clinch o ered the room a
hideous, wraithlike approximation
of a human smile. “You seem like
good people,” he said. “And good
people know better than to take
what isn’t theirs. And this—this is
mine.”
He reached out through the
batwing doors and, with a hard
yank, pulled a woman roughly
inside by the elbow. Her head was
down as she tried to avoid eye
contact, but even before Clinch

gripped her chin and thrust her
face upward, Albert knew who the
woman was. His heart stopped. It
was Anna.
“Oh, my God …”
Edward and Ruth both turned to
him in shock. Albert felt as though
he were watching events play out
from afar. He had known all along
that Anna was protecting a secret
of some kind, but he’d never
fathomed it could possibly be
something this dark. She’s married.
To
Clinch
Leatherwood.
The
deadliest,
most
ruthless,
most
murderous outlaw in all the West.
“Now, I’m gonna ask again,”

Clinch said quietly. His smile had
vanished. “Who is it?”
No one answered. The move
happened with blinding speed, and
Clinch’s gun was suddenly in his
hand. He pointed it at the head of
one of the gamblers.
“Who?” he said.
The sound of pressurized liquid
impacting fabric could be heard as
the card-playing cowboy pissed
himself in fear. “I … I dunno,” he
managed to croak.
Clinch shot him in the head. The
man slumped to the oor, blood
slowly pooling outward from his
ruined skull.

Clinch looked around at the
terri ed saloon patrons. “I’d very
much like to be introduced to the
man I’m looking for. So you all
make sure he gets this message:
Either he meets me in the
thoroughfare at noon tomorrow—
or I start killing more people.”
He turned to depart, pulling
Anna forcefully along with him.
With great shame in her eyes, she
stole a furtive glance at Albert that
lasted all of a half second before
she was dragged away.
The room breathed a sigh of
relief. Edward and Ruth stared at
their friend.

“Albert, you gotta get outta
here!” urged Edward with alarm.
How eeting Albert’s dalliance
with blissful clarity had been. He
was devastated all over again.
The horses came to a halt in the
middle of the prairie just north of
Old Stump. Clinch dismounted and
gave Anna a brutish yank, pulling
her down from the saddle with him.
Plugger moved anxiously nearby,
whimpering as if he knew there
was trouble afoot. Clinch thrust
Anna against the side of a rock
formation jutting up from the
ground and made it clear with one

sharp, deadly glance that any
attempt to escape would be met
with unchecked violence. He turned
to Lewis. “There’s an abandoned
sod house over around that bend.
We’ll stash the gold there. Take the
boys and set up camp. I need some
alone time with my wife.”
Lewis ashed Anna a rat-faced
smile of vindictive satisfaction.
“Will do, Clinch. C’mon, boys!”
The rest of the gang galloped
away with him as Clinch turned his
full attention toward his immediate
concern. He approached Anna,
who looked at him with the
revulsion most people would have

reserved for a decaying corpse. He
gently caressed her cheek with one
hand, then swiftly backhanded her
across the face, knocking her to the
ground.
“Who is it, you whore?” he
growled.
She pulled herself to her feet,
never taking her eyes o him.
“Mark Twain,” she said.
Clinch stared at her for a long
moment before he nally spoke. “It
is?”
“No! Jesus, how fucking stupid
are you?”
His face twisted into a snarl, his
eyes narrowing to razor-thin black

slits. He drew his gun and pressed
it into the center of her forehead.
She pulled back slightly from the
pressure but did not flinch.
“Who?” he said in his deadly soft
tone.
Anna waited just long enough to
make the theatrics of the moment
seem convincing, then averted her
gaze to the ground with an
expression of shamed resignation.
“It’s Sheri Arness,” she said at
last, turning to Clinch with
moistened eyes. “Please don’t hurt
him, I’m begging you!” Part of her
felt a pang of guilt for passing such
a mortal buck to the sheri , but he

was the sheri , after all. It was his
job to deal with assholes like this.
Clinch made it a moot point,
however. “After all these beautiful
years together, you don’t think I
know when you’re lying?” He
cocked his pistol. Anna shut her
eyes and prepared for the
inevitable. Then, suddenly, the
piercing sound of Plugger’s barking
split the air as the nappy mutt
bounded up, growling and baring
his teeth at Clinch. The outlaw
looked down, and that bloodless
gash of a smile split his face open.
Anna felt the barrel of the gun
pull away from her forehead, and

she exhaled as she opened her eyes.
Her relief quickly evaporated,
however, as she saw that Clinch
had aimed the gun at Plugger.
“Either you tell me his name,” he
said, “or ol’ Plugger here gets a
plug in his head.”
She knew her options were
exhausted. This time when she
averted her gaze to the ground,
there were no theatrics at play.
“Albert,” she whispered. “Albert
Stark.”
Clinch lowered his gun. “There.
That’s much better.”
For one horrifying instant Anna
thought he was going to shoot

Plugger
anyway,
but
Clinch
holstered his pistol.
He turned and strode back to his
horse, removing his hat. “I’ve
missed you, darling,” he said.
without warmth or a ection. “I’ve
missed you a lot.” He removed his
vest and his shirt and draped them
over the saddle. His back was to
her.
I’ll never get another chance, she
realized.
Clinch went on, while undoing
his trousers, “But now we got time.
We got time to be husband and
wife. The proper way.” His pants
were only halfway down when the

blow struck the back of his head.
He fell to the ground, unconscious,
as Anna stood over him holding the
bloodied rock. His bare ass stared
up at her in a most undigni ed
way.
Anna went to mount his horse,
then paused as she looked down at
him again. “Ah, shit,” she said. “I
can’t leave him like this.”
She approached the base of the
stone formation, picked a small
ower, and stuck it in Clinch’s ass
crack with the bloom facing
upward. “That’s better,” she said.
She mounted his horse and raced
back toward Old Stump.

Edward was one of many local
businessmen nailing signs to the
front doors of their establishments
reading CLOSED UNTIL FURTHER
NOTICE. No one was taking any
chances with the gang of outlaws
in town.
Ruth approached him as he was
pounding away at the nal nail.
“Eddie?” she said, her tone
indicating a subject of importance.
“Yeah, sweetheart?”
“Eddie, I’ve been thinking. With
Clinch Leatherwood in town, and
with everyone so scared, I … it’s
got me wondering.”
“What is it?” he said, giving her

his full attention.
“Well, any of us could die
tomorrow. I mean, we don’t know
what’s gonna happen. And … I
think we should have sex.”
His full attention doubled.
“What?”
“I think we should have sex
tonight.”
“Okay.”
“Yeah?”
“Yeah. Let’s.”
“I
mean,
under
the
circumstances, God will forgive us,”
she said, looking to him for
affirmation.
He gave it to her. “I think so.

We’ll make sure there’s a Bible in
the room so God can watch. Then
He can be a part of it. Ahhh, I’m
getting excited now!”
Albert was hastily packing his
bag when he heard the hoofbeats.
His breath stopped as he hurried to
the window, expecting to see
Clinch and his gang descending on
the farm. But when he peered out
through the uneven ripples in the
glass, he saw Anna galloping
toward the cabin. He couldn’t
decide whether that was better or
worse. He did not want to see her,
now or ever again.

Albert went back to packing. He
heard her knock on the door, but
he did not respond.
“Albert!”
she
called
out,
uncharacteristic alarm in her
normally
rock-steady
voice.
“Albert, are you in there?” When
he still didn’t answer, she let
herself in. “Albert! You’ve gotta get
out of here!” she exclaimed.
He did not look up to make eye
contact with her. “Yeah, that’s
exactly what I’m doing.”
“No I mean, you have to leave
now! Clinch is gonna be looking
for you!”
Albert
continued
stu ng

clothing, books, and cans of food
into the bag. “Yeah, I’m leaving.
I’m going to San Francisco. Which
is what I should have done weeks
ago.”
She looked at him mournfully.
“I’m sorry.”
“Yeah, well, so am I.”
Anna oundered a bit as she
searched for something to say next.
“What about your dad?”
“I asked him if he wanted to
come, and he said no. He’s up on
the hill burying himself next to
Mom.”
She waited a beat, then spoke
again. “Look … I never meant to

mislead y—”
“Oh, Anna, don’t even waste my
time with that,” he shot back,
whirling to face her directly. “You
had a million opportunities to tell
me. And you fucking lied.”
“I didn’t lie,” she insisted with a
pleading tone. “I just made the
choice to keep certain things to
myself. I honestly, truly thought it
was for the best. I would never lie
to you.”
Albert was privately insulted by
her attempt to sell such a Jesuitical
interpretation of the word. A lie of
omission
remained
a
lie.
Nonetheless, he chose not to

engage. “I don’t care,” he said
atly, and went back to his
packing.
“Look, I couldn’t tell you. It was
for your own safety.”
“Oh, bullshit.”
“That, and … I liked you. A lot,”
she said with undeniable sincerity.
“I didn’t want to scare you away.
I … never thought I’d meet
someone like you.”
“Oh, what, someone who hasn’t
killed people? Yeah, I guess that’s
pretty hard to nd. That’s why
women are always saying, ‘Ugh,
why are all the non-murderers
taken?’ ”

“It’s not my fault, okay? We
were married when I was nine!”
Albert lowered his wall just
enough to release a momentary
burst of genuine astonishment.
“What? Nine? Jesus Christ, how
does that even happen? Was there a
ceremony?”
“Yeah, my parents were there, a
couple of neighbors. I didn’t wanna
wind up one of those fteen-yearold spinsters.”
“Well, you know … I shouldn’t
be surprised,” he said, more to
himself than to her. “Every girl I
fall in love with ends up
disappointing me.” He nished his

packing and closed the bag.
“You … you love me?”
“Don’t worry, I’m over it. You
can go now.”
For the first time since Albert had
met her, Anna lost her shit. “All
right! Yes, I lied! Fine! What should I
have said? Oh hi, I’m Anna—I’ve
been fucking a killer since I was ten!”
“Oh, he waited a year. What a
gentleman.”
“Well, late nine, I rounded up.
Look, I’m done with him! I knocked
him out and stuck a daisy in his
asshole.”
“What?”
“That’s how much you mean to

me.”
Albert slung his bag over his
shoulder. He was tired. Tired of the
conversation, and tired of inviting
pain into his life. “You know what?
I loved a girl who doesn’t even
exist. I loved Anna Barnes, not
Anna Leatherwood. Hell, is your
name even Anna? Or is it
something
terrible
like
Gwendolyn?”
“No. It’s Anna. I’m the girl you
loved. That was the real me—
possibly for the rst time in my
life. I suppose, when I really think
about it, you’re the rst person I
haven’t lied to. Look, I never

thought I deserved a good guy. But
I do. I love you. Just give me one
more chance. Please. We can get
out of here—we’ll go to San
Francisco together. Start a life. All I
want is to be with you.”
Albert said nothing as he looked
into her eyes, searching for some
clue to whether she could be
trusted. She was as beautiful as
ever, and he wanted very much to
say yes, to run o with her that
very instant. But he remembered
the pain of losing Louise. He’d
trusted a woman with his heart,
and she had betrayed that trust
when he was at his most exposed.

He never wanted to feel that kind
of raw, numbing misery again. And
if that meant never again opening
his heart to love, well, then, that
was a price he was willing to pay.
He de ected her hazel-eyed gaze
back at her with a hardened look of
his own. “Sorry,” he said. “I’m not
gonna get fucked over again.”
Before
she
could respond,
however, the sheep began to bleat
loudly from the corral. Albert went
to the window and looked out. He
couldn’t see anything at rst, but
when he squinted he could make
out a dust cloud in the distance,
indicating the approach of a group

of horses. “Someone’s coming,” he
said.
“It’s Clinch.” Anna knew.
They both knew. And this time
there would surely be no talk. He
would kill them on sight.
Albert grabbed her by the arm
and pulled her toward the door.
“Go on, get out of here. There’s a
trail out back that leads to the
ridge. Go.”
“What are you gonna do? Albert,
he’ll kill you!”
“Don’t worry about me, just go!
Now!” He pushed her roughly but
not unkindly through the doorway
and out into the yard. She quickly

mounted her horse, then hesitated,
staring back at him. They shared a
momentary glance, both realizing
that this could be the last time they
would ever see each other. Anna
kicked her horse, spurring him into
an immediate hard gallop. And
then she was gone.
Clinch and his men roared like
thunder onto Albert’s farm. The
already disorganized sheep ock
scattered even more as they ed
the onslaught of outlaw hooves.
The men dismounted and burst into
the cabin, ransacking everything in
sight as they searched for their

quarry.
After several fruitless moments,
Lewis turned to his boss. “He’s not
here, Clinch.”
They were about to look
elsewhere when Clinch noticed
something. A bag resting in the
corner. He picked it up and opened
it. It was fully packed with clothing
and food. His bloodless smile made
its latest appearance as he slowly
drew his gun.
Albert crouched low on all fours,
hoping for all the world that he
wasn’t visible. In each hand, he
clutched a stful of white wool,

courtesy of the two sheep on either
side of him. He pulled hard,
making sure they didn’t drift. The
ock
was
made
up
of
approximately sixty sheep, and
Albert had concealed himself smack
in the center. He knew that as long
as the sheep remained grouped
together, he should be able to wait
out Clinch’s search without being
discovered.
They would turn the house
upside down, nd it empty, and
deduce that Albert had ed. After
that they would probably head
back to town and scour every nook
and cranny there too. By the time

they realized that he had escaped,
he would have such a lead that,
even if they guessed which
direction he’d gone, they’d never
catch up.
He listened intently until nally
he detected the outlaws emerging
from the cabin. He waited for the
sound of horses being mounted.
Surely Clinch would give up the
search now. But what Albert heard
next reined his heartbeat to a
screeching halt.
“I know you’re here, Stark.”
Albert noted the sinister pleasure
in Clinch’s voice. It chilled him to
the bone. He heard the men slowly,

methodically walking the premises
as they searched for him. How the
fuck did he know? And then he
realized the idiocy of his mistake.
The bag. Clinch had found the bag,
opened it up, and seen the
supplies. Since only a fool would
leave food, water, and supplies
behind when riding o into the
desert, Clinch would recognize that
Albert must still be here.
Albert began to panic. All that
stood between him and certain
death was a ock of sheep. And
Clinch Leatherwood was not the
type of man to leave a stone
unturned. Albert would be found.

And then he would be killed. There
would be no explaining the
situation, no pleas for mercy. He
would die.
He could hear the soft jingle of
multiple
spurs. They’re getting
closer. He realized if he had any
hope of saving his own life, he had
to act soon. And then a possibility
occurred to him. Curtis. Curtis is tied
to the corral fence. It couldn’t be
more than
fty feet from where
Albert was hidden. If he could
somehow reach Curtis, he might be
able to mount the horse quickly
enough to get a head start.
Outrunning the outlaws from that

point was another matter—Albert
was hardly the world’s greatest
equestrian—but
his
only
alternative was to wait here and be
shot.
From the recesses of his memory,
Albert recalled the story of
Odysseus’s escape from the cave of
Polyphemus. The blind Cyclops had
let his sheep out to graze, feeling
their backs one by one to ensure
that his prisoners were not
escaping. However, Odysseus and
his men had cleverly attached
themselves to the undersides of the
giant sheep, using them to slip
away to freedom, undetected. It

should have been an inspiring
image. But Albert was no Odysseus.
And Clinch was not blind.
Albert crawled on his stomach
through the packed ock, resisting
the urge to retch when he felt his
hands press into the soft, wet piles
of sheep shit and the puddles of
foul ovine urine. He slowly made
his way, inch by inch, toward
Curtis. How much farther did he
have to go now? Thirty feet?
Twenty? He would have to risk a
peek. He held his breath and
peered over the top of a sheep
back. Curtis was now only about
fteen feet away. Depending on

where the outlaws were, he might
be able to sprint for it. He turned
and looked in the other direction …
… and almost had a stroke.
Lewis was standing within spitting
distance, facing away from Albert.
Albert dropped to the ground and
lay motionless on his back. He
dared not make a sound. After a
few moments, he tried to focus
through the mini-forest of sheep
legs to see if Lewis was still there,
but it was di cult to make
anything out. He looked up, but all
he could see was the underside of
the nearest sheep. Its pink sheep
dick stared at him with its single

cyclopsian eye—making him think
again of Polyphemus—and pissed
in his face.
Albert remained frozen, fear now
mingled with horror. Once the
sheep was nished evacuating its
bladder, Albert wiped o
his
drenched face with his sleeve,
trying desperately not to throw up.
After he had more or less collected
himself, he decided to risk another
glance. He slowly peered over the
sheep’s back once again. Lewis was
gone. He had moved to the other
side of the ock. In fact, all the
members of the gang were on the
opposite side. They appeared to be

preparing to search the barn. He
would never have a better chance.
His heart in his throat, Albert
took a deep breath … and bolted to
his feet. He charged through the
remaining sheep, scattering them
on either side, as he made directly
for Curtis. Luck was on his side. He
had almost
nished untying
Curtis’s reins when one of the
outlaws spotted him.
“Clinch!”
Clinch and the other members of
the gang whirled in Albert’s
direction. They immediately drew
their guns and started for him, but
Albert swung into the saddle and

spurred Curtis into a gallop. The
outlaws raced to their mounts and
broke into pursuit.
Albert leaned in hard as he
pushed the horse faster than he
ever had in his life. “I never make
you go fast, buddy,” he pleaded.
“Give it to me today!”
Comprehending, Curtis took his
speed up a half notch. Albert could
hear the pounding of outlaw
hooves behind him as Clinch and
his men gained ground. When the
surrounding vegetation diminished
and the chase reached the open
prairie, Albert knew he was in for
the long haul. There was nowhere

to hide out here. Nothing to do but
keep running until escape or death
won the day.
And then the gun re started. The
shots were deafening, and out of
the corner of his eye Albert could
see little geysers of dust erupting
from the sand as the bullets struck
the ground, several of them just
inches away from Curtis’s hooves.
“Curtis, you outrun these guys, and
I’m gonna take you to a horse
whorehouse. You’ll get so much
horse pussy. Just please, go faster.”
The gang was still gaining. One
of the bullets punctured a hole in
the canteen attached to Curtis’s

saddle. Water sprayed out behind
Albert as he kicked hard at Curtis’s
sides. Albert had never ridden so
fast and so hard, yet he knew it
was not enough. And then
something caught his eye o to the
left. He turned and saw a pu of
black smoke on the horizon.
It was his only hope. He veered
hard left just as a bullet whizzed by
his right ear. He exhorted Curtis
again and again, knowing it was
useless—the horse’s legs were
already pumping at top speed.
Finally, Albert crested a small rise
and saw the train tracks below.
The freight train was traveling on

a perpendicular course to his own.
He would get only one shot at this,
but if it worked …
He headed straight for it. A few
more bullets whistled by him, and
then one grazed him on the ankle.
He realized it was almost the exact
same spot that Charlie Blanche had
shot him not so long ago.
The train raced onward, and he
raced toward the train. At the nal
instant, Curtis uncorked a last
reserve of speed, evidently bottled
for just such an occasion. Horse
and rider dashed at the tracks a
mere half second before the train
barreled past.

For the moment, Albert was safe.
Clinch and his gang were forced
to wait for the train to pass
completely before they could
resume their pursuit. The outlaw
horses idled aggressively back and
forth, fueled by the fury of their
masters. At last, when the caboose
whizzed by and shrank into the
distance … Albert was gone.
Clinch stared darkly at the
receding train as Ben galloped up
beside him. “What the hell do we
do now, Clinch?”
“Now,” Clinch said, “we nd my
wife.”

By the time dusk fell, Albert had
managed to nd a suitable spot to
make camp. Not that he had any
supplies—the well-stocked bag he’d
prepared was still sitting on the
oor back in his abandoned cabin.
A small amount of water had
remained inside the punctured
canteen, but Albert had drained it
hours ago. He would have to nd
water soon, or he’d be in real
trouble. He might be a little
hungry, but he could at least rest
for the night and figure out his next
move in the morning. And there
was even a bit of green vegetation
in the area, so Curtis wouldn’t have

to go to sleep on an empty
stomach. God knew the horse
deserved a good meal after the way
he’d come through for both of
them.
Albert hadn’t realized he’d had it
in him, but when he’d seen an open
boxcar coming along the track,
he’d known it was the di erence
between life and death. He’d gone
at a hard gallop straight toward
the side of the speeding train.
Curtis had leapt into the open
boxcar, and he and Albert had been
carried o to safety. Albert had
never loved the animal more than
he did right now.

“Curtis, you saved both our lives
today. As soon as we’re out of this,
I’m gonna nd you some horse
whores, just like I promised.”
Curtis snorted his enthusiasm for
the concept.
Albert ru ed the horse’s mane
a ectionately. “Now,” he said,
turning his attention to matters of
immediate concern, “how the fuck
do you make a fire?”
THWACK!!
He was unconscious before he
realized he was not alone.
Edward sat on the bed in his
room above the shoe-repair shop,

dressed only in his drawers. Ruth
stood before him with a giddy smile
on her face. She wore nothing but a
simple chemise. It was a big night
for both of them, and the special
moment was now at hand.
“Okay, here we go.” Edward
grinned, his bare feet tapping the
floor with nervous energy.
“Are you excited?” said Ruth.
“I am. I’m really pumped.”
“Me too.”
“This is gonna be my
rst
vagina,” he admitted with a blush.
“You’ve never seen one?”
“No. I feel like I should have a
piece of cake or something.

Y’know, to celebrate.”
“Yeah, I’m actually a little
nervous myself.”
Edward
giggled.
“You’re
nervous? Wow, and you’re a
prostitute!”
“I know, right?” she said, joining
in the laughter. “Okay. Ready?”
“Yup!”
Ruth pulled up her hem,
exposing her womanhood.
Edward’s bright, eager smile
became
accid,
then
nally
disappeared. He stared in silence
for a long while.
“What?” she nally asked with a
furrowed brow.

“Um …”
“What’s wrong?”
He pointed. “It’s … that right
there, right?”
“Yeah.” She indicated. “It’s from
here to here.”
“Huh.” He put his chin in his
hand ponderously and leaned back
a bit with the air of a math
professor piecing together a
difficult equation. “It’s … I … wow,
I don’t … I don’t get it.”
“You don’t like it?”
“No, I—it’s just—weird. It’s a
weird thing. It’s like … someone
wrapped a
recracker in roast
beef.”

“Well, yeah, but there’s a lot
more to it.” She opened it up,
showing him the rest.
His eyes snapped open in shock.
“Oh! Oh, dear! Oh, my Jesus,
Mary, and Joseph! Were you
injured? Are you in pain right
now?”
“No, Eddie, it’s supposed to be
like this.”
“It is?” he asked in disbelief.
“Yeah. Well, I mean, maybe not
exactly like this, but listen—it’ll feel
good. For both of us.”
Edward calmed a bit. “Gosh, I’m
sorta glad I didn’t have that piece
of cake.”

She
smiled
comfortingly.
“Eddie … just trust me.”
Ruth extinguished the light,
discarded the chemise, and climbed
into bed with him. She eased his
head gently back down onto the
pillow and climbed on top of him,
guiding his twitching penis inside
her.
“Oh, boy,” he said with alarm.
“Okay, easy, now, I’m—okay. Oh.
Okay. Okay, I see. Yeah, now I get
it. ’Cause of the warm and the soft
and—yeah. Yes, okay, yeah, God
would want this.”
The
rst moment of carnal
pleasure Edward Phelps had ever

experienced
was
almost
immediately cut short when his
amateur pounding was interrupted
by an even harder pounding on the
door.
Ruth
sighed
loudly
with
annoyance and climbed o him.
She hastily threw on her chemise
and padded across the room. When
she opened the door, she found the
last person she’d expected to see.
“Anna?”
“Ruth, can I come in?” Anna
said, in a clear state of distress.
“Um, yes. Yes, of course.”
Anna hurried into the room as
Ruth shut the door behind her.

Edward sat up, scrambling to
cover his nakedness with the
sheets. “Don’t come over here! I
don’t want you to see my penis.”
Edward’s penis appeared to be
the last thing on Anna’s mind. She
had ridden straight out to the ridge
from Albert’s cabin, then realized
she could not go any farther. Since
she had been old enough to
understand what her life really
was, she had been running away
from herself. She had denied the
woman she wanted to be for too
long, and it was time for that
denial to end, at any cost—even
death.

She knew her redemption lay
with Albert. Unfortunately they’d
been separated, and she did not
know where he’d gone. She didn’t
even know if he’d escaped. So she’d
backtracked to the cabin, which she
found deserted. For lack of an
immediate plan, she sought out
Edward and Ruth back in town, but
when she’d arrived at the saloon at
dusk, the word was that Clinch and
his men were out to hunt her down.
And now here she was.
Anna ran to the window and
looked out. From the upper level
that housed Edward’s apartment,
she had a clear view of most of the

thoroughfare. Almost immediately,
she spotted them. Five
gures,
moving up the street, methodically
entering each building. As they
moved a little closer, she could
make out their faces. It was Clinch,
all right. As she watched them,
trying to get a sense of their search
pattern so she could strategize her
escape route, he looked directly up
at the window. Anna quickly closed
the curtains. “Shit!” Had he seen
her? She thought he’d made eye
contact, but she couldn’t be sure.
“Ruth, I need a place to hide!” she
said breathlessly. There wasn’t
much furniture in the room and no

closet to speak of. Under the bed?
Behind the dresser? Neither were
promising
choices.
As
they
frantically looked for an option,
they heard the sound.
Thump. Thump. Thump.
Ruth ran to the side window and
looked out. “Oh, my God,” she
whispered. “The side stairs. He’s
coming up the side stairs!” The
glass was warped and caked with
dust, but there was no mistaking
the shadowy
gure making his
ascent toward the apartment.
Anna ran to the window that
faced the thoroughfare and pushed
it open. She climbed out onto the

roof, made her way carefully down
the wooden planking, and jumped.
When she landed, she was faceto-face with Clinch.
At that same moment, the
shadowy gure reached the top of
the stairs and kicked open the
apartment door. Ruth and Edward
found themselves staring down the
barrel of Lewis’s pistol, his rat like
face scowling at them with
accusation.
Edward extended his hands in an
appeal for mercy. “Please don’t
shoot us on sex night!”
Lewis grunted angrily but left

them in one piece.
“I’m not suggesting we run with
this,” said Edward when he and
Ruth were alone, “but when he
pointed that gun at us, my erection
came back.”
Albert blinked groggily as he
regained consciousness. The world
was dark and blurry. Everything
was swimming in marsh water. He
tried to lift his hand to rub his eyes
but found that he was unable to do
so. In addition, there was an
intense pain in the back of his
head. He was lying on his back on
some sort of hard, narrow surface.

It was terribly uncomfortable.
When he looked up, he could make
out a series of unde ned shapes
surrounding him from above.
Faces?
He tried to get up, but his hands
were bound tightly behind him.
And then he realized he wasn’t
lying on his back at all. He was
standing … tied to a post of some
sort. He blinked hard a few more
times, and the world coalesced into
clarity. The shapes he had seen
were indeed faces. Thirty of them,
to be exact. Old faces, young faces,
pu y faces, gaunt faces—and all
wore expressions of hostility.

Apaches.
Albert looked down at his feet,
knowing all too well what he
would nd there. Kindling. They’re
going to burn me. Out of the frying
pan and into the re. Literally. Albert
had escaped Clinch and his gang by
a hairsbreadth, only to wind up
cooked like a turkey by a tribe of
renegade Apaches. For about the
millionth time in his life, Albert
had the thought that had become as
familiar as a pair of old shoes: God,
I fucking hate the West.
Three of the Apache warriors
approached him,
holding
lit
torches. Astonishingly, one of them

looked
familiar.
He’d
seen
drawings of this man, and one time
even a photograph. It was the
infamous Apache chief Cochise,
who had earned a reputation as a
force to be reckoned with for his
resistance to the expansion of
white civilization throughout the
territory. Jesus, I’m the last guy you
should be killing, thought Albert. I
hate white civilization as much as you
do.
Cochise raised his torch and
spoke in the Apache language,
“White man, because your people
are such huge assholes, I am going
to light you on fire.”

The three Apaches moved toward
the pyre and prepared to light the
kindling.
Albert spoke suddenly. “Stop!”
The warriors moved back,
startled. Not because of the word
he’d said but rather because he’d
said it in perfect Apache.
Cochise ordered his men to stand
down for the moment. They
complied but kept their torches at
the ready. He then addressed
Albert, once again in his native
tongue. “How is it that you, an
asshole, have the power to speak
our language?”
Albert answered with perfect

diction. “I am a nerd asshole. Since
the other white assholes do not like
me, even though I am one of their
own, I have always kept to myself.
Therefore, I have read many books,
know many languages, and am
good at math.”
Another Apache spoke up from
the group. “Quick, what is 27 times
89?”
“2,403,” said Albert.
Several
of
the
warriors
murmured
among
themselves,
aware that the white man had
answered correctly.
“Why are you out here?” asked
Cochise.

“Please untie me, and I will tell
you.”
Cochise turned to the two torchbearing warriors. “Well, he speaks
our language, which means there’s
no reason not to trust him.”
Albert breathed a sigh of relief as
they lowered their torches and cut
him loose.
Some time later, Albert found
himself sitting around a camp re
with Cochise and about nine or ten
of the other Apache warriors. It
was a scenario he never would
have imagined in a billion years.
Nonetheless, they were anxious to

hear his story and to know how
and why he had wound up all the
way out here by himself. He told
them everything.
“… And after I escaped on the
train, I rode like the wind,” he
concluded, “and the next thing I
remember is waking up in your
camp. And now I have no idea
what to do.”
Cochise regarded Albert for what
seemed like a very long time, then
turned and whispered something to
the leathery-skinned Apache elder
seated at his right. The elder slowly
nodded. Cochise turned back to
Albert. “I will show you the way,”

he said.
He gave a wordless hand signal
to one of the younger warriors. The
man rose from the circle and
stepped away into the darkness. He
returned a few moments later with
a cactus bowl containing some sort
of viscous liquid. The warrior
handed the bowl to Cochise, who
took a sip and then passed it over
to Albert.
“What is it?” Albert asked
uneasily.
Cochise gave him a meaningful
stare. “Your path.”
Albert didn’t recognize the uid
in the bowl, but he had a pretty

good sense of what it was, having
just been through this with Anna
and her goddamn cookie. “I’ll freak
out, I know it,” he said, giving
Cochise
a
look
of
severe
apprehension.
“You won’t freak out, I swear.”
“You don’t know me. I’m serious,
I’m very sensitive to drugs.”
“Nerd.”
The other tribesmen joined in the
taunting. “Nerd! Dork! Tool!”
Albert reluctantly submitted to
the peer pressure. “Okay, ne!” He
downed the rest of the liquid.
Almost instantly, the Apaches’
taunting expressions shifted to

shock and alarm. “He drank the
whole bowl!”
Albert froze in panic. “What?”
“You drank the whole bowl!”
“Oh, shit! Oh, shit, is that bad?”
“That was for the entire tribe!”
said Cochise. “You’re totally gonna
freak out and probably die. Good
luck.”
Albert’s jaw hung open in terror
as the world around him dissolved
into a distorted hellscape.…
He tried to move his arms, but they
remained locked at his side.
Something was holding him in place.
He looked down to see that his entire

body was sandwiched between two
brown, rough-looking sides of the
same giant vise. Wait, not a vise … a
walnut? Yes, a walnut. He was
trapped in the center of an oversized
walnut. But where the hell was he?
When he looked up, he saw stars.
Countless stars. Never had he seen so
many. But what terri ed him was
what he saw when he looked down:
More stars. Thousands. He was
floating above the sky, in the heavens,
and there was no up or down. He
could see, on all sides of him, other
walnuts of various sizes circling the
sun.
Somewhere o to his left, another

light source ared up. Albert turned
and was astounded to see a massive
cloud of gas and dust expanding from
a single point too far away to
ascertain. Every color in the known
spectrum was engaged in a sort of
misty water ballet; there were even a
few new colors Albert had never seen
before. New colors? How was that
possible? But before he could
contemplate it further, the gas cloud
contracted as quickly as it had
expanded. The gorgeous multihued
formation was drawn into a rapidly
widening vacuum. A gaping hole
opened up, like some horri c maw
leading back to a dark time before

creation that no living man should
ever see.
And then everything was sucked
inside. The walnuts, the stars, the gas
and dust, and Albert. The intensity of
the pull ung him free of the nut in
which he’d been con ned, and he
found himself being hurled at blinding
speed through a vast tunnel, which
that seemed to twist and turn at
random like an agitated earthworm
being poked with a twig by a sadistic
child.
And then all at once he was on
solid ground. He hadn’t felt the
impact, but nonetheless he was here,
lying prostrate on an uneven surface.

He lifted his head and spat out a
mouthful of sand. He was back in the
desert.
But as he struggled to stand, he
saw that it was not his desert. Not the
Southwest. There was no vegetation
here, no rocks, no dirt—just sand.
Miles and miles of sand, with dunes
stretching all the way to the horizon.
It looked more like the North African
deserts he’d read about in books.
He was not alone. Something was
here
with
him. A dark shape
momentarily blocked out the sun, and
Albert heard a piercing SHRIEEEEK.
He looked up just in time to see a
massive black condor descending

toward him from the sky. It was
moving as fast as a locomotive and
appeared to be nearly half the size of
one as well. But that wasn’t the only
thing wrong with it. Its eyes glowed
bright green, and it had fangs. No
bird that Albert had ever seen or
heard of had fangs. This was a hellish
demon-bird that looked as though it
had burst into reality from a mythical
tale created by some long-dead and
best-forgotten savage civilization.
Albert tried to scream, but nothing
came out. So he ran. He ran as fast
as he could, which in this nightmare
world still felt like moving through
molasses. Just as the condor was

upon him, he lunged over the crest of
one of the dunes, tumbled violently
down a steep embankment—
—and crashed through a layer of
solid ice.
Albert plunged deep into the frigid
water beneath. He immediately swam
for the surface but could nd no
opening. Beneath the solid ice, he
was trapped. He began to panic again
as he pounded on the frozen ceiling
with both sts, his lungs aching with
pressure as their nal reserves of
oxygen were depleted.
Then at last, just as the grip of
unconsciousness tightened around his
body, he found the opening through

which he had fallen. With all his
remaining strength, he pulled himself
up out of the water, nding purchase
on the snowy shoreline that rimmed
the freezing pool. He stood up,
dripping and shivering, and surveyed
his surroundings. He was in an Arctic
wilderness, and there was a blizzard
in full force. Stinging snow akes bit
and snapped at his face at the same
time that he became aware this was
no ordinary tundra. There were tall
palm trees peppering the landscape,
so curiously equidistant from one
another that they looked almost
arti cially placed. Each frond was a
di erent color, which gave them a

striking rainbow e ect. But what drew
Albert’s attention more than anything
else was the cabin. It was his cabin.
Just plopped out here in the middle of
this insane, otherworldly panorama.
He ran toward it, partly out of
curiosity and partly out of fear of
death
from
pneumonia
or
hypothermia. He reached the cabin
door and hurried inside.
It was his house, but empty. No—
not completely empty. There was a
lone rocking chair next to the cold,
unlit
replace. Because he had
nowhere else to go, Albert walked to
the chair and sat down.
Almost instantly the walls around

him began to ripple. At rst, he
braced
himself
for
another
transition—Jesus, what’s next, the
moon?—but it was merely the room
itself that was changing. The rippling
intensi ed, turning the walls and oor
into lique ed, ocean-like waves of
wood and sod. And then, abruptly, it
stopped.
The room was no longer empty.
There were chairs, tables, paintings,
and photographs on the walls. It was
still Albert’s cabin, but its personality
had been entirely altered. It had been
transformed into a cozy, beautifully
decorated home. He almost didn’t
recognize it.

And there was Anna.
She was seated in a second rocking
chair on the other side of the
replace, which now roared and
crackled and gave o
a warm,
comforting
glow.
Anna smiled
wordlessly at Albert as she stitched
some ornately embroidered words
into a pillow: Don’t go snackin’ if
you been tobaccin’. After a moment,
she set down her stitchery and
pointed off to his right.
When he turned, he noticed a
small table that hadn’t been there a
second ago. On it sat a steaming cup
of co ee. Albert felt himself smile.
Although his clothes and skin were

now somehow dry, he still felt an
inner chill from the ice and snow. He
could certainly use a cup of co ee.
He picked it up and prepared to take
a sip, but stopped as he looked into
the cup. The co ee was spinning like
a whirlpool. It was almost hypnotic,
and soon he found that he could not
take his eyes o it. He could still feel
h i s body placed rmly in the chair,
but at the same time he had the
distinct sensation that he was being
pulled down, down, down into the
eye of the whirlpool.
And then he was no longer inside
the cabin but rather was sitting on a
hard, ribbed surface. He looked

down. Wicker. Wicker on the oor,
wicker on the walls … no, not walls.
I’m in a basket. He scrambled to his
feet, and his breath caught in his
throat as he took in his latest
surroundings.
He was oating in a hot-air balloon
surrounded by trees. But these trees
were impossibly, fantastically tall.
Whether Albert looked up or down,
he could not see where they began or
ended. The trunks simply receded to
in nitesimally small points in the
distance.
He felt the balloon quiver slightly.
When he gazed up, he saw that the
fabric above him now bore a gigantic

face. A face he knew all too well.
Foy’s face. “Balloon moustache,
balloon
moustache,” it sang in
echoey,
dissonant,
reverberating
tones. Albert grimaced in repulsed
confusion, but before he could react
further, a dark shadow passed
overhead. The black condor swooped
down from above, ripping Foy’s face
to shreds with its massive talons.
Unfortunately, the balloon itself was
also in tatters, and Albert began to
plummet fast. He let out a scream as
he looked down and saw the trunks
racing past him at blurring speed.
Still, the ground had yet to make an
appearance. His fall accelerated, and

Albert could feel his face rippling from
the force of the descent. His insides
pushed angrily at the back of his
throat like an invading army with a
battering ram at the gate. Then,
suddenly, with a hard, skull-rattling
jolt, it stopped.
He glanced up and found that the
balloon had caught on a branch. He
was swaying back and forth
pendulously, and the branch looked
ill-equipped to hold his weight for
long. He looked down again and saw
the forest floor at last.
It was a sea of raging fire.
The branch snapped.
Albert braced himself for death as

the basket plummeted again and the
flames rushed up to meet him—
THUD!
He landed on a patch of soft green
grass. The impact had been harder
than the others, and he thought for a
moment that his nose was broken, or
at least bleeding. But when he poked
at it gingerly with his index nger, it
felt intact. He struggled to his feet
and looked around. He was standing
in a wide-open eld, surrounded at
its perimeter by a thick layer of pine
trees. It was an oddly silent place,
bereft even of birdsong. And then he
began to hear the clip-clop of hooves.
He turned toward the sound.

Approaching from the distance was
the most ornate horse-drawn carriage
he had ever seen. It was a bright
shade of purple, and was pulled by
two milk-white mares bedecked
entirely in gold-colored tack. The
carriage came to a stop directly in
front of Albert. The horses did not
stir, but Albert got the distinct sense
that they were waiting for him to act.
He cautiously moved toward the side
door and grasped the handle. When
he opened it, his head spun.
Beyond the door was the interior of
a Gothic church. It was dazzling in
design, lusciously opulent in décor—
and full. There had to be
ve

hundred people in attendance, all
lavishly dressed and all staring
expectantly at Albert. Most were
strangers,
but some
folk he
recognized from Old Stump: Edward,
Ruth, Millie, Doc Harper, Sheri
Arness—and Anna.
She was dressed in a owing white
wedding gown and stood at the altar,
attended by Pastor Wilson. Her gaze
was warm and welcoming as she
beckoned him to approach. The
magnetism of the vision was
irresistible. Albert stepped through the
doorway …
… and tumbled out the other side
of the carriage. He felt the wind

knocked out of him as his rib cage
absorbed the impact. He pulled
himself up, clutched his side in pain,
and turned back toward the open
door. The church was gone. All that
remained was the inside of the
carriage, which looked just like any
other. Even the bright purple
e e rve sce nce of the surface had
become dulled. He reached an arm
inside, searching, grasping for any
trace of the vanished mirage, but
found
nothing.
Instead
of
disappointment, however, he felt
something else. Anger. Something had
tantalized him with this gateway to
the life he wanted and then

deliberately denied him access. It was
then that Albert realized, with a wave
of release, how tired he was of being
a perpetual punching bag for the
endless blows the western frontier
hurled at him.
He heard the unmistakable shriek
of the condor. He looked up as the
monstrous creature bore down on him
from the sky once again, its eyes
glowing an unearthly green, its white
fangs glinting bestially in the sunlight.
But this time, Albert did not run.
Something tugged at his waist, and
when he looked down he saw that he
was wearing his gun belt. Without a
moment’s pause, he drew the pistol

and red several rounds at his avian
attacker. To his frustration, the bullets
did not pierce the bird’s skin, instead
bouncing o harmlessly. However,
the bird did veer away from its
trajectory and circled back up into the
air. It swung around for another
assault, and Albert red at it again.
His gut wrenched as he heard the
click-click of an empty chamber. No
more bullets.
The condor dove directly for him.
He was about to run when he noticed
a bulbous feathered convexity
between the condor’s legs. A ball
s a c k , he
realized. Completely
exposed and unprotected. Could it be

that easy …? The bird came at him,
shrieking with open jaws. As it
overtook him, Albert kicked the ball
sack as hard as he could with the toe
of his boot. The condor let out an
earsplitting, hellish scream that
echoed all across the eld as it spun
away, head over tail, o into the sky,
until it vanished to a pinprick of
darkness against the sun.
Albert sat up with a violent start.
The light was suddenly gone. He
could feel a thick coat of
perspiration descending the surface
of his face. As he took in his
surroundings, he realized he was

still sitting around the camp re,
with the Apaches watching him
intently. The rst pink ribbons of
dawn were visible on the edge of
the horizon. Albert felt a gentle
hand on his shoulder. It was
Cochise.
“Did you shoot the black condor
and kick it in the balls?” asked the
wizened old warrior.
Albert was startled. “Yes. How
do you know that?”
Cochise’s eyes crinkled as he
gave Albert a warm, knowing
smile. “It means that true courage
does indeed lie within you. If you
can trust in its power, then you

may yet find happiness.”
——
Several hours later, Albert stood
facing the entire Apache tribe at
the edge of their camp. He
regarded Cochise with a look of
gratitude. Albert had begun his
odyssey as their prisoner, and now
he was closing it out as the
bene ciary of their wisdom and
kindness.
“Thank you for everything, Chief
Cochise. I don’t know what I
would’ve done without you.”
Cochise gave him a look that was

almost paternal. “There is an
ancient proverb among my people:
Sometimes the only way for a man
to discover his true path is to take
drugs in a group.”
Albert nodded. “Thank you for
letting me take drugs with you. I
know what I have to do now.”
He gave Cochise a long embrace,
mounted
Curtis,
and
waved
goodbye. The Apaches watched as
he galloped off toward his destiny.
The main thoroughfare of Old
Stump was overcast and deserted
as Clinch Leatherwood dragged his
wife out into the center of the

street, his pistol pressed against her
side. Lewis, Ben, and the rest of the
gang watched with amusement as
their leader began his deadly
theatrical display.
“All right, sweetheart,” he
whispered into her ear, his foul
breath assailing her nostrils, “now
we’re gonna nd out whether your
little boyfriend gives a fuck about
you.” Clinch took out the gold
pocket watch for which he’d shot a
man not three months before. “He’s
got six minutes till noon. If he
doesn’t show, he’s gonna be
picking up pieces of you all over
the street.” Clinch shouted at the

empty horizon. “STARK!!”
There was no answer. Anna
stood stone-faced, ever the picture
of courage. She knew she was
going to die today, but she also
knew she’d be goddamned if she’d
give her bastard of a husband the
pleasure of seeing her break. In
reality, the last thing she wanted
was for Albert to make an
appearance. There was no way he
stood a chance against Clinch. She
already felt the regretful sting of
her own betrayal, and she did not
want to be responsible, indirectly
or not, for his death.
For a moment, they all struck a

morbid tableau: a large and sinister
man with a reptilian gaze standing
rigidly in the center of the street, a
loaded pistol against his wife’s ribs,
his gang watching as if they were
witnessing a carnival show rather
than a prelude to murder, and
dozens of goatish frontier faces
with fearful eyes peering helplessly
from windows, doorways, alleys,
all too terri ed to emerge. Even
the sheri watched from the safety
of his o ce, displaying his usual
ineffectiveness.
And then, from the distance, the
sound of hooves. As they grew
closer, Anna’s heart sank even

deeper. No, Albert, no! Get out of
here or he’ll kill you too!
Albert appeared astride his horse
at the end of the thoroughfare.
When he came to a halt, his
clumsy, nerdish dismount only
ampli ed her distress. Was he
insane? He was a sheep farmer
with one week of shooting practice
under his belt, and he was going to
go up against the deadliest outlaw
in the West?
“Let her go, Clinch.” To his
credit, Albert’s voice was steady.
Clinch gave Anna a loveless
squeeze. “Well, now,” he said with
an evil grin, “true love conquers

all, doesn’t it, sweetheart?”
“Albert, don’t be stupid!” she
shouted desperately. “Get the hell
out of here!”
Clinch twisted her arm, hard.
“Too late for that,” said the outlaw.
“He’s already been real stupid,
haven’t you, Stark? You’ve been
with my wife.”
Albert seemed to carefully
measure his response. “Well, I
mean, we haven’t done it, if that
makes a difference.”
Clinch shoved Anna roughly
toward Lewis, who restrained her
rmly—and with far too much
pleasure—and leveled his gun at

the space between Albert’s eyes.
Albert sti ened, but held the other
man’s gaze. “Y’know, I hear you’re
a pretty tough guy, Clinch. Well,
why don’t you prove it? You and
me. Gun ght. Right here, right
now.”
Clinch brightened visibly. He
looked almost entertained, as if
someone told him he was about to
be treated to a puppet show. “You
really do have a death wish, don’t
you?” he said with a grisly little
cackle.
“But—” Albert raised a hand.
“But let’s make it interesting. One
bullet apiece. One for you, one for

me.”
For a moment, Clinch actually
looked caught off guard. “What?”
“Yeah. Empty all your bullets but
one. Unless you think you need
more than one to kill me.”
Clinch hesitated. He certainly
had no fear at all of this lowly,
pathetic sheep farmer, but he also
was clearly unable to calculate
what Albert’s angle was. He
eventually seemed to decide it
made no di erence. His dark smile
returned as he emptied the
chamber of his pistol save for one
round.
Albert did the same.

“Okay. On the count of three, we
shoot,” said Albert, a few beads of
perspiration popping out on his
forehead.
Clinch nodded.
Albert took a deep breath.
“One … two …”
Albert fired.
He hit Clinch in the left arm.
Clinch looked down at the
wound, then slowly lifted his gaze
back to Albert, that awful smile
spreading across his face in tandem
with the blood. He let out a big
gu aw that echoed eerily across
the expanse of the empty town. “I
been playing cards a long time,

and I’ve never seen such a bad
gamble, Stark. Where’d you learn
to shoot?”
“Your wife.”
“Aw, snap,” whispered Edward
from his doorway.
Clinch stopped laughing. He
raised his gun and cocked it.
Albert dropped his own gun and
raised both hands plaintively.
“Look,
before
you
shoot
me … grant me a few last words.
Please?”
Clinch sneered. “Why not? Yes,
let’s savor this moment.”
“Okay, good. Thank you. Look—
just promise me one thing. Let

Anna live. Please. She didn’t kiss
me, I kissed her. So it’s my fault.”
Albert paused in momentary
thought. “I mean, she didn’t tell me
she was married, so it’s kinda her
fault too, I guess, so … yeah,
actually, that’s true. So maybe just
shoot her in the leg? That seems
fair, right?”
Anna gave him a what-the-fuck
stare.
Albert went on. “And one more
thing: My grandparents were
Arabic, so if you’ll indulge my
religious
beliefs
here … Immediately before death,
I’m required by Muslim tradition to

recite the Islamic death chant.
This’ll only take a moment.” And
Albert began to warble a stream of
vocal dissonance that sounded like
a goat being castrated.
Has he lost his fucking mind? Anna
thought. It wasn’t until he’d been
at it for several seconds that she
became aware of a change in
Clinch. He was blinking rapidly.
And he’d broken out into a sweat.
He glanced around unsteadily,
appearing to falter a bit. His aim
drifted, until eventually his gun fell
from his quivering hand. He
seemed to be having enormous
difficulty maintaining his balance.

“What the … what the hell is
happening?” he grunted weakly.
Anna had the same question. Is
this witchcraft or something?
Albert ceased his warbling and
addressed Clinch again. “You
know, Clinch, there are a million
ways to die in the West. There’s
disease,
famine,
exposure,
gun ghts … and wild animals. You
know, like snakes. And the
interesting thing about snakes is,
you don’t even have to get bitten.
All you have to do is get the venom
into your system, and you’re pretty
much screwed. Let me tell you
about a little trick some Apache

friends of mine taught me recently:
You take a certain amount of
venom from a diamondback rattler
and drain it into a hollowed-out
bullet tip, and, you know what?
You really only need one shot.
Now, I knew my aim wasn’t good
enough to hit you anywhere
important, but if I caught you by
surprise … Well, Anna taught me
enough to get me in the ballpark.
And it didn’t matter where I hit
you, as long as the bullet broke the
esh. Because just a little bit of
venom in an open wound is
enough to kill a man if he’s—”
“Albert. He’s dead.”

“Huh?”
It was Ruth who had spoken. She
stood over Clinch’s collapsed body.
“He’s dead. You killed him.”
“Oh.” It was true. Clinch lay
unmoving on the ground.
“Did he hear all the smart stu
that I did?”
“No, I don’t think so.”
“Oh. Okay. It’s still good,
though.”
A wide grin broke out across
Anna’s face as she elbowed Lewis
in the gut. He doubled over in pain
and surprise, just as the sheri and
deputy emerged from their o ce,
guns trained on Clinch’s men.

Anna ran to Albert and threw her
arms around him, raining kisses
upon him with all the passion of a
parched castaway suddenly being
given water. His lips melted into
hers for a full minute before she
pulled away, gazing at him with
love, pride, and profound relief.
“Not bad, sheepboy,” she said.
“Not bad at all.”
“Sorry I killed your husband.” He
felt at least some obligation to say
it.
Anna took his hands in hers.
“Albert … it’s the sweetest thing
anyone’s ever done for me.”
“Which is kinda fucked up, huh?”

“Yeah, it is kinda fucked up, isn’t
it?”
They kissed again. When they
parted this time, Albert became
aware that he was being observed.
He turned to look behind him.
Standing there was Louise.
“Hey,
Albert,”
she
said
flirtatiously.
“Oh. Hey, Louise.”
“Listen,
um
…
if
you
wanna … talk about things, I’d like
that. I could come by your place
later on tonight.”
A very short time ago, Albert
would have shot himself in the
knee just to hear her speak those

words. And now he felt nothing. It
was not until that moment that he
knew he was truly free. Free from
her emotional grasp. Free to pursue
happiness with someone who was
ready to love him for the rest of his
life.
“I can’t, Louise.” He smiled. “I
really need to work on myself. But
thank you for your interest.”
He didn’t see her face fall, as he
was already walking away, hand
in hand with Anna.
Anna turned to him with
electri ed eyes as something new
occurred to her. “Y’know … you
s h o t Clinch Leatherwood. The

deadliest gunman on the frontier.
There’s probably gonna be reward
money.”
“Huh. I didn’t think about that.”
“So, what are you gonna do?”
And that was how, in the warm
Arizona summer of 1882, Albert
and Anna Stark, newly wed in the
little town of Old Stump, came to
embrace beside his small cabin, in
the center of a great ock of sheep
ve thousand strong. And through
the gift of a new, mint-bright
outlook fueled by a woman’s love,
Albert Stark found that he was
happy to live in the West.
