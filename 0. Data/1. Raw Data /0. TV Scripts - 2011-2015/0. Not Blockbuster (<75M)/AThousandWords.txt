DOUG
Mom! When are we getting out of
here. I'm getting bored.
Doug (10) sits back playing a hand held game. Two women,
DIANA (25) and SARAH (32) walk in carrying boxes. Obvious
sisters, they share a sad look to them.
DIANA
Dougie, you need to sit back and
play your game. We are going to be
here all day.
Doug, flustered sits back hard.
SARAH
He misses mom, doesn't he?
DIANA
Yeah, they got close before she
passed.

Sad.

Who is this?
