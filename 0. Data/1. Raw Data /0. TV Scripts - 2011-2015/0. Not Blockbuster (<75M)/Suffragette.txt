INT. WASHING ROOM. LAUNDRY. BETHNAL GREEN. LONDON. 1912. DAY.
The WHIRR of machinery. Glimpses of female hands toiling
among huge vats, dresses stained with sweat in the damp grey
air.
CAPTION: LONDON, 1912.
THICK WHITE FOG, AT FIRST NOTHING VISIBLE AND THEN THROUGH
THE STIFLING HEAT the FOG IS REVEALED AS BILLOWING CLOUDS of
STEAM hanging like a blanket over a vast laundry floor with
row upon row of WOMEN washing, pressing and folding endless
linen, in continual repeat from vat to hot press to basket.
POLITICIAN V/O
Women do not have the calmness of
temperament or the balance of mind
to exercise judgement in political
affairs.
Through the rising clouds of steam, WOMEN ironing, MRS VIOLET
MILLER [early 40s] amongst them.
POLITICIAN 2 V/O
If we allow women to vote, it will
mean the loss of social structure.
Women are well represented by their
fathers, brothers, husbands.
HOUSE CROWD V/O
(cheering)
Here here.
POLITICIAN 3 V/O
Once the vote was given, it would
be impossible to stop at this.
Women would then demand the right
of becoming MPs, cabinet ministers,
judges.
CAPTION:
FOR DECADES WOMEN HAD PEACEFULLY CAMPAIGNED FOR EQUALITY AND
THE RIGHT TO VOTE.
THEIR ARGUMENTS WERE IGNORED.
IN RESPONSE, EMMELINE PANKHURST, LEADER OF THE SUFFRAGETTE
MOVEMENT, CALLED FOR A NATIONAL CAMPAIGN OF CIVIL
DISOBEDIENCE.
THIS IS THE STORY OF ONE GROUP OF WORKING WOMEN WHO JOINED
THE FIGHT.
INT. WASHING ROOM. LAUNDRY. BETHNAL GREEN. LONDON. 1912. DAY.
THE LOUD BELLOW of a FACTORY BELL. Women begin to file out.

MAUD WATTS [20’S] scrubs a deep washing vat, as the last
LAUNDRY WORKERS drain from the floor.
TAYLOR (O/S)
Maud - take this up to the West
End.
MR TAYLOR [40’s] with irritation, throws a parcel at her, a
central London address clear on the front. It slams hard into
her chest, winding her a little.
TAYLOR (CONT’D)
It’s meant to be there by six.
MAUD nods, sweat and steam blotting her clothes.
MAUD
Delivery should have picked it up.
EXT. YARD/STREET. LAUNDRY. BETHNAL GREEN. 1912. DAY.
MAUD stepping out through the iron gates of the laundry,
clearly the last to leave. She hurries off towards a waiting
BUS gripping the parcel tighter.
EXT. STREET. CENTRAL LONDON. 1912. DAY.
The SWIRL and BUSTLE of the street on the edge of closing
timeMAUD gets off the bus, still gripping the parcel. She weaves
her way past the human ebb and flow.
Fleeting glimpses of SHOP WINDOWS, HOTEL DOORWAYS, a DOORMAN
lets out an ELEGANT LADY, her MAID close by. Several boxes
and shopping bags alluding to an expensive shopping trip.
A STIFF BACKED NANNY, MISS WITHERS, wheels a Silver Cross
pram, a few yards behind MAUD.
MAUD crosses the street.
The SQUEAK of the pram wheel underscores.
EXT. SHOP. STREET. CENTRAL LONDON. 1912. DAY.
A WINDOW display catches MAUD’S eye, showing the peak of
fashion in 1912. A perfect family scene, mother, father and
son by the beach, all dressed in bathing suits.
ON MAUD quietly marvelling- as her eyes scan over the
display, drinking it in.
A clock overhead creeps towards 6pm.

3.
A POST MISTRESS, MISS SAMSON stands seemingly reading a
magazine at a newspaper stall.
MISS WITHERS only inches behind MAUD now. She pulls back the
baby’s blanket to reveal... no baby, but stones. She whips a
stone out and hurls itMISS WITHERS
VOTES FOR WOMEN!
CRASH!
The SHATTER of a shop window right next to MAUD. MAUD turns,
shocked and bewildered by the sudden anarchy as she ducks for
cover, clasping the parcel to her breastHANDS whip out stones from deep inside fur muffs. FINGERS
unfasten handbag clasps pulling out hammers, mallets, rolling
pins.
SMASH!
The FURY and SURPRISE of a SHOP DOORMAN as pandemonium
reigns.
A HORSE rears pulling a nearby CARRIAGEMAUD shocked and shaken, desperate to get away, stumbling as
she runs. The WINDOW DISPLAY she was gazing at, shattered.
EXT. STREET. CENTRAL LONDON. 1912. DAY.

VOTES FOR WOMEN!
SUDDENLY MAUD TRIPS, THE PARCEL SPLITS and LINEN SPILLS AS
SHE FALLS.
Stones and toffee hammers fly all around her as shop window
after shop window shatter into a thousand pieces, sending
shards of glass clattering in paths.
WOMEN (CONT’D)
VICTORY WILL BE OURS.
On MAUD, desperately grappling amongst the shattered glass
and stones to gather up the laundry. HEAVY BOOTS STAMPING
OVER IT.

4.
On MAUD’s rising panic and shock, hesitating on seeingVIOLET caught in the fray.
VIOLET
VOTES FOR WOMEN!
Taking her chance, MAUD turns, fleeing through the
pandemonium, eyes spying a BUS, pulling away, amidst the
chaos. She runs making a leap for itINT. BUS. STREET. LONDON. 1912. DAY.
Heart racing, MAUD sinks down into a seat.
Around MAUD the curious PASSENGERS peer over heads and
shoulders, straining to see the ensuing chaos and violence
raging outside.
The bus travels along the street.
EXT. BACKSTREET/TENEMENT. BETHNAL GREEN. LONDON. 1912.
EVENING.
MAUD hurrying along past the peeling doorways of a London
slum, carrying the split parcel, hurrying to the door of a
rundown tenement blockShe unlocks the front door and hurries inside intoINT. FRONT ROOM. MAUD’S HOUSE. BETHNAL GREEN. 1912. EVENING.
...a neat if rundown room, sparsely furnished. In the corner
there is a hearth and several bits of laundry hanging on a
clothes horse close by. MR SONNY WATTS [late 20s] looks up
from his paper.
MAUD
(hushed)
Is George sleeping?
SONNY
(nods)
Yeah. Mrs Garston fed him bread and
jam.
MAUD reaches for a kettle, touching it, it’s hot. Pouring it
over the linen, she throws in a wash bar of soap resting
close by.
SONNY (CONT’D)
Are you all right? It’s late.
SONNY quizzical, reaches a hand out, touches the graze on her
hand.

5.
MAUD
Taylor sent me up to town.
SONNY
Let me have a look.
MAUD
It’s nothing... I got caught in a
scuffle. There were a load of those
women shouting...
He reaches for a cotton wool and a bottle of alcohol resting
on the mantelpiece.
MAUD (CONT’D)
..Broke all the windows along the
West End.
Reaching for cotton wool and a bottle of alcohol resting on
the mantelpiece, SONNY gestures for her to sit. A painting of
King George V hanging on the wall above.
SONNY
I’ll deliver that package for you
in the morning.
MAUD
Ta.
She winces as he cleans the cut, slowly coming down from the
panic and rush of the last hour.
SONNY
You coming to bed?
MAUD
I’m just going to get this done.
She goes over to the bucket of dirty laundry standing by a
window. Then wearily, she starts scrubbing the dirty clothes.
EXT. TENEMENT. NR MAUD’S HOUSE. BETHNAL GREEN. 1912. DAWN.
The still of the street, bar the lone figure of a WOMAN. Her
hands fish in her pocket for a dried pea, she takes aim,
blowing through a long pea shooter at a window above. The pea
taps at the window. The WOMAN moves onto the next home,
blowing the next pea, offering up another morning call.
INT. MAUD’S BEDROOM. MAUD’S HOUSE. BETHNAL GREEN. 1912. DAWN.
The TAP of the pea against the windowMAUD stirs, SONNY by her side.

to get dressed.
Arms up.

MAUD

Warm laughter as he gets tangled in the shirt.
EXT. TENEMENT. MAUD’S HOUSE. BETHNAL GREEN. 1912. DAY.
MAUD nods, ushering GEORGE towards MRS GARSTON’s front door.
MRS GARSTON
All right, dear?
MAUD reaches in her pocket, pulling out a couple of shillings
- handing them over to MRS GARSTON [late 40s] MAUD’s ruddy
faced neighbour
MAUD
Ta, Mrs Garston.
MAUD pulls GEORGE into an embrace, kissing his forehead.
MAUD (CONT’D)
Oh, come here. Be good.
MAUD crossing the street, passing a NEWSPAPER BOY cutting a
bundle of newspapers open, MAUD’s eyes rest on the newspaper
stand, the board reading- WANTON DAMAGE BY SUFFRAGETTES. MRS
PANKHURST GOES INTO HIDING.
INT. WASHING ROOM. LAUNDRY. BETHNAL GREEN. 1912. DAY.
The wide laundry floor. MAUD at the vats, transferring
steaming piles of sheets.
TAYLOR (O/S)
Oi Mrs Miller! Mrs Miller.
Don’t you ignore me.
MAUD’s distracted by TAYLOR reprimanding VIOLET, caught by
TAYLOR as she crosses the laundry floor.
VIOLET
Sorry Mr Taylor.
TAYLOR
Late again?
VIOLET
Oh I’m barely late it’s only just
gone the hour.

7.
TAYLOR
Shut your mouth. You listen to me.
That’s the second time you’ve been
late and you’ve only been here
three weeks, Mrs Miller.
VIOLET
I ain’t been late...
TAYLOR
Don’t answer me back Mrs Miller.
I’m telling you.
VIOLET
Sorry.
TAYLOR
Do you want me to dismiss you, is
that it?
VIOLET
No, no Mr Taylor. No, sir I don’t.
And I won’t be late tomorrow nor
the day after that, I swear.
TAYLOR
Well you pull your finger out.
MAUD tenses, caught between staying silent andMAUD
(calling over)
Drive belt’s loose again.
TAYLOR distracted, with obvious irritation.
TAYLOR
(moving off)
It was checked Friday.
TAYLOR peering at the machinery by the ironing work station.
MAUD
You can smell burning. I’d check
‘em all.
TAYLOR disgruntled, yells to a FOREMAN.
TAYLOR
Bert! Get your toolbox. Check the
drive belt on the machine.
BERT
Will do boss.
VIOLET’s eyes dart to MAUD, her relief palpable.

Here Maud. That package get to

MAUD
George had his chest again. Sonny
took it up for me this morning.
INT. CHANGING ROOMS. LAUNDRY. BETHNAL GREEN. 1912. DAY.
A half empty changing room, lined with hooks and benches, the
walls are peeling, the sinks chippedMAUD changing amongst the OTHER WOMEN. Their clothes are all
stuck to them, wet through from hours of standing in steam.
Most of the women have sores of some kind from wearing damp
clothes all day. VIOLET stands, somewhat removed, she catches
Maud’s eye and smiles, pulling on her skirt, shivering. MAUD
seeing thisVIOLET
(to MAGGIE)
You ready?
MAGGIE nods.
VIOLET (CONT’D)

control our economic existence.

ALICE (O/S) (CONT'D)
It is men who hold the deeds to our
property.
VIOLET
Who’s that?
MRS ALICE HAUGHTON [early/mid 30s] standing addressing a
growing crowd of FEMALE LAUNDRY WORKERS by the gates.
MAUD
MP’s wife, Mrs Haughton. She's here
at Christmas giving out tangerines
to the children.
Two CHARITABLE LADIES move amongst the departing LAUNDRY
WORKERS giving out flyers to the WOMEN that read - GIVE YOUR
TESTIMONY TO HELP GET WOMEN THE VOTE- smiling and filled with
well meaning. ALICE at the heart of the crowd, determinedly
ignoring the looks and laughter of the PASSING MALE LAUNDRY
WORKERS.
MAUD catching on this. A group of WOMEN start to gather as
ALICE talksALICE
- and the Prime Minister, Mr
Asquith, has agreed to a hearing of
testimonies of working women up and
down the country. We have an
opportunity to demonstrate that as
women are equal to men in their
labours, so they should be equal to
men in their right to vote.
MR CUMMINGS
You’ve never laboured in your life.
DERISIVE LAUGHTER. MORE HECKLES. TAYLOR amongst the men.
SONNY nearby watching.
MAUD drawn closer, now listening, standing by VIOLET’s side.
LOUDER HECKLES NOW.
VIOLET darts a look of growing irritationALICE perseveres, flanked by her CHARITABLE LADIES.
ALICE
This is your moment to come forward
and speak up. I will choose one
person from this laundry to deliver
their testimony at the House of
Commons. These will be heard by the
Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr
Lloyd George.

10.
MRS COLEMAN
(calling)
No one cares, love.
VIOLET
(calling back)
Some of us do, Mrs Coleman, so shut
your bleedin' cake hole.
LAUGHTER MRS COLEMAN SCOWLS, affronted.
MAUD smiles, VIOLET’s spirit infectious. The crowd disperses.
ALICE and the CHARITABLE LADIES give out flyers as they pass.
ALICE
(with a smile)
Thank you for your support. Votes
for women!
ALICE runs after MAUD and VIOLET, gently pushing one into
MAUD’s hand.
ALICE (CONT’D)
(close to)
Ladies, votes for women. The power
is in your hands.
MAUD and VIOLET moving on into the streetALICE (CONT’D)
Thank you ladies.
MRS COLEMAN
Oh go home.
EXT. STREET. LAUNDRY. BETHNAL GREEN. LONDON. 1912. DAY.
ALICE and the two CHARITABLE LADIES moving out of the gates,
chatting to a few WOMEN.
MAUD, still holding the flyer, passes VIOLET greeting a rag
bag of GRUBBY KIDS. MAGGIE takes one of them by the hand.
VIOLET
Hello kids. Give me half a mo.
VIOLET tails MAUD, the rag bag of GRUBBY KIDS close behind.
VIOLET (CONT’D)
Are you gonna give your testimony
then?
The SLICE of human traffic. Cars. Carriages.

11.
MAUD
(shakes head)
Mr Taylor’s a good employer.
VIOLET
To you he is.
MAUD stops, turning on VIOLET.
MAUD
(sharp)
Take that back.
VIOLET
I can’t take back what I see.
MAUD
You’ve been here less than a month.
VIOLET
And?
They sidestep passing BICYCLES.
VIOLET (CONT’D)
I’ve been doing laundry work ever
since I was thirteen. Maggie's only
twelve and she's in here already.
It’s as tough for us women as it’s
ever been. We’ve got to do whatever
we can. However we can.
MAUD
(hushed)
What like smashing windows? It’s
not respectable.
VIOLET
(hushed)
Strangle what’s respectable. You
want me to respect the law, then
make the law respectable.
INT. FRONT ROOM. MAUD’S HOUSE. BETHNAL GREEN. 1912. EVENING.
On MAUD, watching SONNY counting coins from his wage packet
on the table as she sews. GEORGE, nose pressed close to the
table, watches SONNY stacking the coins into a pile.
SONNY
So Georgie, Georgie! This is six.
You ready? You watching?
He balances a small stack of them on his bent elbow. Then at
once, he flicks his arm with a SLAP! Catching them flat in
his hands, entertaining GEORGE.

12.
SONNY (CONT’D)
You got yours?
MAUD hesitates, and nods reaching into her pocket, pulling
out a second wage packet and pushing it across the table. He
rips it open, counting out the wages, a small stack of coins,
half the size of SONNY’s pay.
MAUD
You see Mrs Haughton today? Wants
some of the women to go to
Parliament. She thinks we should be
paid more.
SONNY
On her high horse again.
MAUD wavers, shakes her head, GEORGE in her arms.
SONNY (CONT’D)
Say goodnight to the King, George.
GEORGE raises a hand in salute COUGHING as he does so.
GEORGE
Good night, Sir.
On MAUD, watching GEORGE and SONNY saluting to the painting
of King George V on the wall.

CLOSE on MAUD, her eyes grazing over the endless shelves of
medicines and mixtures, halting on a photograph of MRS
PANKHURST on the wall.

13.
EDITH (CONT’D)
And now another big one please. And
out. Good boy. Ah yes. Here comes
the eleven o’clock just passing
through the tunnel. Good - it’s on
time.
GEORGE giggles, enjoying the experience. EDITH rises.
EDITH (CONT’D)
(To Maud)
He’s alright.
MAUD
You a suffragette, Mrs Ellyn?
EDITH
Yes. But I consider myself more of
a soldier, Mrs Watts.
MAUD
These women’s testimonies make a
difference?
EDITH wavers, carefully putting away her stethoscope in its
box. She nods, following MAUD’s gaze over the many books.
EDITH
Maybe but as Mrs Pankhurst says,
it’s deeds, not words, that will
get us the vote.
MAUD nods, ushering GEORGE ahead of her, following EDITH intoINT. ELLYN PHARMACY. BETHNAL GREEN. 1912. DAY.
...the shop, where MR HUGH ELLYN [mid/late 40s] weighing some
powder on scales.

Now George, do you like barley
sugar?

MISS WITHERS, the nanny seen earlier, parking her pram insideMISS WITHERS
Afternoon. Are the others here yet?

14.
MISS WITHERS wavers on seeing MAUD with EDITH. EDITH
deflects, handing MAUD the bottle of medicine.
EDITH
No, not yet, but you can go
through.
(to Maud)
Plenty of steam with a couple of
drops in the water, twice daily.
Keep him warm.
MAUD nods and reaches for her purse.

No, no. No charge. Goodbye.

15.
BENEDICT
Superintendent Burrill.
BENEDICT shakes hands with BURRILL BURRILL
Mr Haughton. Thank you for coming
here. This isBENEDICT already in, reaching his hand out to shake STEED’s.
BENEDICT
Inspector Steed. Benedict Haughton,
Home Office. I am reliably informed
(looking to BURRILL)
...that you have considerable
experience of counter surveillance
within the Special BranchSTEED, the calm centre of the room.
STEED
(nods)
I’ve gathered intelligence on
various anarchists, sir, including
Fenian agitators in Liverpool and
Manchester. I can show you.
STEED moves to the table and nods to DETECTIVE MALCOLM WALSOP
[40s] who passes the camera to BENEDICT. He reaches for a
second, passing this to another OFFICIAL on his left.
STEED (CONT’D)
(to BENEDICT)
Employment of these cameras would
be the first of its kind in this
country. They’re considerably more
advanced than anything we’ve used
before.
BENEDICT picks up a camera, examines it.
STEED (CONT’D)
Compact enough to be used without a
tripod, it means we can operate
them covertly on the streets.
CLOSE on BENEDICT’S eye, peering through the viewfinder.
INT. DARKROOM. POLICE STATION. BETHNAL GREEN. 1912. DAY.
A CONSTABLE stands in front of a bench, developing a batch of

16.
STEED
Right. Let’s start with Mrs Edith
Ellyn. Chief commandant. She’s
clever. Been arrested nine times,
incarcerated four. She’s educated,
without scruples. Makes her
particularly dangerous. It’s worth
noting her husband, Mr Hugh Ellyn,
pharmacist. He’s been incarcerated
twice for abetting his wife’s
activities. Fully paid up member of
the Men’s League.
A PHOTOGRAPH OF VIOLET is pegged on the line, other
PHOTOGRAPHS of MISS WITHERS and MISS SAMSON visible.
STEED (CONT’D)
(tapping photograph)
This is an old hand. Mrs Violet
Miller. She moves around a lot.
Been arrested a number of times,
incarcerated twice. Spits out
children. Husband’s a violent
drunk. She agitates, gets her hands
dirty. They’ll be using her zeal to
recruitSTEED and WALSOP step back, admiring the row of PHOTOGRAPHS.
STEED (CONT’D)
... to justify the unjustifiable.
MAUD’s surveillance image catches his eye - MAUD leaving the
pharmacy with GEORGE.
STEED (CONT’D)
Now, who’s this here?

VIOLET, quietly defiant, ignoring TAYLOR’s smirk.
VIOLET

On MAUD, reluctantly taking VIOLET’s testimony, the words
swimming in front of her eyes. MAUD looks back at VIOLET,
clearly struggling.

seatedLLOYD GEORGE
Shall you begin Mrs MillerALICE and VIOLET seated near the back with a few other
OFFICIALS.
MAUD
...Watts. It’s Mrs Watts, Sir.
A PRIM FEMALE TYPIST TAPS away at a typewriter close by,
taking this down.
MAUD (CONT’D)
Mrs Miller isn’t able to. I have
her testimonyMAUD looks down at the paper, faltering, LLOYD GEORGE seeing
this. He smiles kindly LLOYD GEORGE
You work at the Glasshouse Laundry
in Bethnal Green too?
MAUD nods. She looks down at the paper and then over at ALICE
who silently urges her onMAUD
I was born there.

22.
LLOYD GEORGE
Then I should like to hear your
testimony.
LLOYD GEORGE smiles, waits.
MAUD
I don’t know what to say.
LLOYD GEORGE
Your mother worked at the laundry?
On MAUD, a quiet decision made as her arm drops, paper in
hand.
MAUD
From when she was fourteen. She’d
strap me on her back or under the
copper vats if I’d sleep. All the
women did it who had babies then.
LLOYD GEORGE
Your employer allowed that?
The TAP TAP of a typewriter as the FEMALE TYPIST transcribes,
MAUD growing in confidence. ALICE watching closely.
MAUD
He’d have you back as soon as you
could.
He?
Mr Taylor.

LLOYD GEORGE
MAUD

LLOYD GEORGE
And does your mother still work at
the laundry?
MAUD
(shaking head)
She died when I was four.
On ALICE catching on this.
LLOYD GEORGE
I see.
MAUD nods, hesitates, yet LLOYD GEORGE’s silence, quietly
provokes her on.
MAUD
Vat tipped, scalded her.
The TAP of the typewriter momentarily comes to a still. LLOYD
GEORGE and others visibly unsettled. ALICE looks on, moved.

23.
LLOYD GEORGE
What of your father?
MAUD
(shrugs)
Don’t know him.
LLOYD GEORGE
And you worked for Mr TaylorMAUD
..part time from when I was seven,
full time from when I was twelve.
Don’t need much schooling to
launder shirts. I was good at
collars, steaming the fine lacing.
Got the hands for it. I was made
head washer at seventeen. Forewoman
at twenty. Twenty four now soLLOYD GEORGE
You’re young to have such a
position.
MAUD
Laundry work’s a short life if
you’re a woman.
ON STEED seated at the back of the room, watching her,
assessing.
LLOYD GEORGE
And why is that?
MAUD
You get your aches and your chest
cough, crushed fingers. Leg ulcers,
burns, headaches from the gas. We
had one girl last year poisoned.
Can’t work again. Ruined her lungs.
LLOYD GEORGE
And your pay?
MAUD
We get thirteen shillings a week,
sir. For a man it’s nineteen and we
work a third more the hours.
They’re outside most days on
deliveries so at least they’re in
the fresh air.
LLOYD GEORGE
What would the vote mean to you,
Mrs Watts?

24.
MAUD
I never thought we’d get the vote
so I’ve never thought about what it
would mean.
LAUGHTERLLOYD GEORGE
So why are you here?
MAUD hesitates, then with realisationMAUD
The thought that we might...
MAUD wavers - suddenly moved, caught out by her own emotion.
MAUD (CONT’D)
That this life... that there is
another way of living this lifeMAUD unable to go on untilMAUD (CONT’D)
Sorry. My words... I’m not...
LLOYD GEORGE
No..No..
On LLOYD GEORGE visibly moved, MAUD looking beyond, sensing
the room listening to her, wavering with surprise.
LLOYD GEORGE (CONT’D)
The finest eloquence is that which
gets things done.
STEED quietly noting it all down.
LLOYD GEORGE (CONT’D)
Thank you, Mrs Watts. I believe we
have that all down. We will have a
response for you very soon. An
amendment to the bill might just
force the change towards the vote.
MAUD
Thank you, sir.
ON MAUD, considering, she nods.

SONNY
Mrs Haughton can afford it.
MAUD pulls off her clothes.
MAUD
(confidently, still high)
I spoke, Sonny.
SONNY
I thought you was just gonna
listen.
MAUD
Violet couldn’t so they asked me. I
was just going to say what she
would have said but then he asked
me if I worked in the laundry as
well and I just started talking. To
Mr Lloyd George.
She walks over to their bed.
MAUD (CONT’D)
If we got the voteSONNY
What would you do with it Maud?
MAUD
Do the same you do with yours,
Sonny. Exercise my rights.
SONNY
Exercise your rights? You a
suffragette now, one of those
Panks?
No-

you.

They laugh, a little giddy.
INT. BACK ROOM. ELLYN PHARMACY. BETHNAL GREEN. 1913. EVENING
MAUD alone, eyes falling on EDITH’s coat hanging on the back

of purple, green and white ribbon with several silver bars.
EDITH enters, carrying a small tray of food. She sets it down
on the side.
MAUD’s eyes graze over the various chemistry certificates on
the wall. She peers closer, each award in EDITH’s name.
MAUD
Where are Mr Ellyn’s certificates?
EDITH
Oh he hasn’t any. He has me. His
father passed the business to him.
But he never took to chemistry. I
actually wanted to become a doctor.
My father didn’t approve. I’m still
good at diagnosis.

27.
MAUD
So you married-?
EDITH
(nods)
23 years now. I had hoped that one
day it might have read Ellyn and
daughters.

EXT. TENEMENT. MAUD’S HOUSE. BETHNAL GREEN. 1913. DAY.
On VIOLET waiting outside MAUD’s house. A MALE LAUNDRY WORKER
comes out of his house, looking on at her with obvious
disapproval.
MALE LAUNDRY WORKER
Oi, Mrs Miller, bet you wish you
were a man.

On MAUD, catching on this as she ushers GEORGE out of the
house, SONNY close behind ignoring the MALE LAUNDRY WORKER.
VIOLET
(calling after)
Bet you wish you were too.
MALE LAUNDRY WORKER
Saucy cow!
The MALE LAUNDRY WORKER falls into line with OTHER WORKERS,
nodding to SONNY, smirking in passingMAUD
Wish us luck.
SONNY

On MAUD hurrying over VIOLET.
VIOLET
You ready?
Yeah.

MAUD

VIOLET hands her a small posy of flowers, white, purple and
green - the suffrage colours. MAUD takes it, smiles, pinning
it to her lapel as they head off up the street, spirits high.
VIOLET
Here you are Maud. You gotta look

EXT. COURTYARD. HOUSE OF COMMONS. LONDON. 1913. DAY.
ON MAUD, EDITH, ALICE AND VIOLET as they move through a
growing crowd of SUFFRAGETTES, gathering around the HOUSE OF
COMMONS steps, a sense of excitement, MAUD and OTHERS smiling
at its heart. A SINGING SUFFRAGETTE stands by a POLICEMAN
guarding the gates - ‘March Of The Women’ the Suffragette
anthem carrying across the crowd. The atmosphere is almost
festive. MAUD filled with excited anticipation, her arms
locked in VIOLET’s.

29.
ALICE
(craning to see)
Can you see anything?
MAUD
They haven’t opened the doors yet.
VIOLET turns on seeing MISS EMILY WILDING DAVISON [early
40s].
Suddenly a door opens, the sense of MINISTERS about to exit.
A PRESS PACK of JOURNALISTS SURGE FORWARDMAUD (CONT’D)

The crowd livelier now, MAUD jostles with the OTHERS, all
craning to see over the tops of heads towards the steps.
EXCITED CHATTER ALL AROUND.
SEVERAL PRESS PHOTOGRAPHERS stand, cameras held in waitingLLOYD GEORGE emerges mounting the steps, paper in hand,
BENEDICT close behind.
MAUD, ALICE, EDITH and VIOLET all move towards the steps. The
SNAP of PRESS CAMERAS and MURMUR OF JOURNALISTS LOOKING FOR
COMMENT.
LLOYD GEORGE
The Prime Minister duly reviewed
all the women’s testimonies. After
careful debate with a number of
MP’s very sympathetic to the
women’s cause, it was carried that
there was not the evidence to
support any change to the Suffrage
Bill.
What?

VIOLET

HECKLES FROM THE CROWD. LOUD JEERING.
MAUD stares dumbfounded. Her eyes meet VIOLET’s, similarly
shocked.
JOURNALIST
No votes for women then, Sir?
LLOYD GEORGE
No, no votes.
MAUD
But Mr Lloyd George listened. He
took it all down.

car.

Come on now, you’ve had your fun.
Get back.
INCREASING NOISE all around. The tension building as MORE AND
MORE WOMEN see the POLICE OFFICERS, arming themselves ready
to attack, pushing forward, seeping into the crowd. Behind,
STEED moves towards an OFFICER, caught amongst the fray.
The POLICE OFFICERS lunge at the WOMEN as peaceful protest
dissolves into violent attack. The WOMEN caught unawares by
this sudden, brutal onslaught. The SINGING SUFFRAGETTE is
brutally beaten with a truncheon.
MAUD
Hey! Leave her alone!
ON MAUD, panic and terror overwhelming her, cornered with the
crowd kettled against a wall.

MAUD is pulled down to the ground by a LARGE OFFICER.

a truncheon against her head as she refuses to concede.
STEED looks on, impassive.

The LARGE OFFICER arrests MAUD, dragging her by the hair
towards a waiting POLICE VAN. Blood falling across the
pavement as EDITH is manhandled into the van.
STEED looking on as MAUD is hurled violently into the back of

counter, hurriedly writing a cheque, about to hand it to the
POLICE OFFICER.
BENEDICT
How much is bail?
OFFICER
Two pounds, sir.
ALICE
No, Benedict, you must bail all the
women. I cannot be the only one to
go free. Benedict pleaseALICE snatches the cheque out of his hands, reaching for a
pencil.
BENEDICT
I will not.
ALICE
How much is the sum?
OFFICER
Two pounds, each.

ALICE
Twelve pounds to release all the
women. Please sign it.

It’s my money. My money.
BENEDICT turns on ALICE gripping her tightly by the arm.
BENEDICT

But you’re my wife. And you’ll act
like a wife. I have humoured you
Alice, thus far but... this is an
outrage.

Thank you.
ALICE fumes. BENEDICT straightens his coat, nods to the
POLICE OFFICER and then waiting, turning to ALICE.
BENEDICT (CONT’D)
Come on.
On ALICE, reluctantly following BENEDICT.
INT. INTERVIEW ROOM. POLICE STATION. WESTMINSTER. 1913. DAY.
MAUD sits at a wooden table, bruised and in shock, her eyes
quietly following the steady TICK TICK of the clock overhead,
edging towards six. STEED enters and sits.
MAUD
I have to fetch my son by six.
(silence)
I’m late. He’ll need his tea.
STEED
You won’t be home for tea.
STEED clocks the wedding ring on her finger, MAUD seeing
this, hands shaking, she presses them firm in her lap.
STEED (CONT’D)
Would you like me to contact your
husband, Mrs Watts?
On MAUD, panic rising, desperately trying to keep it in.
MAUD hesitates. STEED nods, calm, letting the silence hangSTEED (CONT’D)

I picked up a suffragette last week
-

33.
MAUD
(sudden)
I’m not a suffragette.
STEED
Rough little diamond. In her
bloomers? Three bricks. Works for
Mrs Pankhurst directly. I asked her
why she does it. She said it makes
her life worth something.
(close to)
She’s just the hod carrier.
MAUD
I’m not a suffragette.
STEED
I’m glad. You know they say that
the way in which certain types of
women have acted in the past months
gives a good deal of colour to the
argument that the mental
equilibrium of the female sex is
less than that of the male’s. But I
don’t agree. There’s no madness in
it. They know exactly what they’re
doing. But my opinion doesn’t
matter. My job is to enforce the
law, Mrs Watts. So I’m going to
give you some advice now and I
sincerely hope you take it. You’ll
serve your time now. At worst
you’ll get a week. Then you go home
to your husband.
On MAUD, eyes stinging with tears, holding his look with
quiet desperation. STEED stands to leave.

EDITH catching on VIOLET’s words.
EDITH
We all get separated from those we

worked day and night, fighting for
me to be educated as my brother
was, but that didn’t come without a
sacrifice.

string and notesWALSOP
Intelligence confirms a growing
intention to retaliate.
STEED
They’re putting their strategy in
place. Our contact in Lewisham
tells us Mrs Pankhurst is to give
an address.
BURRILL
When?
STEED
Any day now. We don’t know where
yet...
STEED’s pensive look caught on a photograph of MAUD’s face.

Maud. It’s good to see you again.
MAUD
Have you heard her speak before?
EMILY
Many times. She is without fear.
They share a smile, Maud buoyed by her excitement.
VIOLET rushes up behind them.
VIOLET
Emily, Edith’s waiting for us.
(to MAUD)
You made it then?
They round the corner where EDITH is waiting.
VIOLET (CONT’D)
Edith!
EDITH
You’re here. We must hurry. It’ll
be the first time she’s appeared
for months. They’ll be on alert to
arrest her.
A sense of growing excitement as they head up the street.

PANKHURSTWHOOPS and APPLAUSE. Delighted whispers all around ‘It’s Mrs
Pankhurst’.
The CHEERS BUILDING. MRS PANKHURST opens her arms, calming
them. MAUD smiles, beaming at VIOLET.
MRS PANKHURST
My friends. In spite of His
Majesty’s Government I am here
tonight.
MORE CHEERS - on MAUD, hanging on every word.
MRS PANKHURST (CONT’D)
I know the sacrifices you have made
to be here. Many of you, I know,
are estranged from the lives you
once had. Yet I feel your spirit
tonight.
MAUD catching on thisMRS PANKHURST’s eyes travel over the sea of WOMEN’s faces,
all looking up at her, hanging on her every word. WOMEN of
all social classes gathered together. MRS PANKHURST smiles,
pushing on.
MRS PANKHURST (CONT’D)
For fifty years we have laboured
peacefully to secure the vote for
women. We have been ridiculed,
battered and ignored. Now we have
realized that deeds and sacrifice
must be the order of the day.

MRS PANKHURST
We are fighting for a time when
every little girl born into the
world will have an equal chance
with her brothers. Never
underestimate the power we women
have to define our own destinies.
We do not want to be law breakers,
we want to be law makers.
CHEERS
SUDDENLY THE DISTANT BEAM of CAR HEADLAMPS flick up, grazing
the WOMEN’s faces, bringing urgency to MRS PANKHURST’s
speech.
MRS PANKHURST (CONT’D)
Be militant. Each of you in your
own way. Those of you who can break
windows, break them. Those of you
who can further attack the sacred
idol of property, do so. We have
been left with no alternative but
to defy this government.
The CROWD ERUPTS WHISTLING, CHEERING, FOOT STOMPING, SINGINGA POLICE WHISTLE blows. POLICE VEHICLES push into the crowd.
MRS PANKHURST (CONT’D)
If we must go to prison to obtain

government not the bodies of women
that shall be broken.
VIOLET turns to MAUD.
VIOLET
Round the back Maud. Round the
back.
MRS PANKHURST
I incite this meeting, and all the
women in Britain, to rebellion!
On MAUD, EMILY, EDITH and VIOLET as they weave their way
through the crowd.
MRS PANKHURST (CONT’D)
I would rather be a rebel than a
slave!

Sonny. I’m sorry.
SONNY
I took you on, Maud. I thought I
could straighten you out.
On MAUD, pain, edged with a growing angerMAUD
What if you don’t need to?
SONNY
You’re a mother, Maud. You’re a
wife. My wife. That’s what you’re
meant to be.
MAUD
I’m not just that any moreSONNY despairing, shoving her away.
MAUD (CONT’D)
(growing desperation)
Sonny...Sonny, what are you doing?
MAUD reaching for SONNY, trying to stop him as he enters the
house. He rounds on her before she can get back in, gathering
up anything he can find of hers as he comes out again; coats,
hat, boots, a bag, a box...anything - just ridding the house
of MAUD, hurling MAUD’s things out onto the street.
MAUD (CONT’D)
Sonny...Sonny...
GET OUT!

SONNY

He slams the door on her.
MAUD hammering on the door, terror and desperation growingMAUD

MAUD with VIOLET climb the stairs into a small room,
following a PINCHED LOOKING LANDLADY.
LANDLADY
It’s two and six a week.
VIOLET
Make it two and four. The union
will pay.
The LANDLADY eyes VIOLET and MAUD with obvious disdain before
turning away. MAUD takes in the rundown room, now alone with
VIOLET.
VIOLET (CONT’D)
I’ll get you blankets and clothes
from the WSPU jumble. They collect
stuff for women whoVIOLET wavers, sees MAUD’s misery growing.
VIOLET (CONT’D)
I’m sorry.
On MAUD breaking, tears starting to flow.

50.
VIOLET (CONT’D)
No no no. Don’t cry. It aggravates
them more if they see it hasn’t
touched you. So you practise now on
me. Do it Maud.
VIOLET reaches out a hand, touches MAUD’s cheek, wiping away
MAUD’s angry, desperate tears.
VIOLET (CONT’D)
And God shall wipe away all their
tears; there shall be no more
death, neither sorrow, nor crying.
Neither shall there be any more
pain: for the former things are
passed away.
MAUD nods, sobering, wiping away the last of her tears.
VIOLET kisses her on the forehead and passes her hand over
the bed, springs pushing through the fabric.
VIOLET (CONT’D)
(shouting out)
Two and four a week and a bed of
bleedin’ nails!
SUDDENLY the bed collapses to the floor. VIOLET SCREECHES.

BENEDICT clearly in a fury, facing off STEED and BURRILL as
WALSOP and others look on.
WALSOP
So, Mrs Pankhurst briefly out of
hiding. Gentlemen this is a
deliberate escalation that the
government will not accept. Who
knows what they will do next.
STEED
They have been given orders to be
ready. The East London branch in
particular is to mobilise.
WALSOP
Should we be taking these threats
seriously?

51.
BENEDICT
I would not underestimate the
threat. Neither would the Prime
Minister.
STEED
If it’s to be tackled, we need to
get closer in. I hope to track down
those still open to persuasion and
have them infiltrate and inform on
the others. We’ve identified
weaknesses in the ranks. We’re
hoping one of them will break.
STEED pulls out a file of photographs that include MAUD,
EMILY, EDITH and VIOLET.
STEED (CONT’D)
So I’m going to release these to
the press.

a trolley away.
On MAUD, at her station ignoring TAYLOR on the approach. He
lays the newspaper down on an ironing press next to her,
silently turning the pagesTAYLOR

not a bad photograph, though.
On MAUD, looking at TAYLOR and seeing the newspaper with the
surveillance photos.

On MAUD, steely.
TAYLOR (CONT’D)

TAYLOR creeps his hand around MAUD’s back, leaning into her
ear, his breath warm against her neck, one hand flat on the
ironing press.
TAYLOR (CONT’D)

After everything I done for you.
CLOSE on MAUD, angry untilMAUD

AND AT ONCE, MAUD reaches for a scalding iron, slamming it
down. It lands hard on TAYLOR’s handThe HISS of STEAMTAYLOR’s blood curdling scream, echoing across the laundry
hall. MAUD looks back at SONNY and hurries out, clocking the
shocked stares of the other MALE LAUNDRY WORKERS, their
contempt palpable. One LAUNDRY WORKER goes to TAYLOR’s aid.

by two LOCAL UNIFORMED POLICE OFFICERS. STEED exits the room
and calmly sits down next to her. He stares straight ahead,
as if in innocent conversation with MAUD.

53.
STEED
You’ll walk free. Out of here
today. In return - you will help
me.
MAUD wavers, turns to look at him, sobering.
STEED (CONT’D)
There is information that you will
pass to me... Anything you know,
anything you hear, even if it’s
only a snippet or a piece of
conversation, it is of interest.
MAUD stares dead ahead.
STEED (CONT’D)
Look at me.
MAUD meets his eye with conviction.
MAUD
He deserved it. If I told youSTEED
Do you really think anyone listens
to girls like you? That anyone
cares? They don’t. You’re nothing
in the world. I grew up with girls
like you. People who sacrificed
life for revenge and a cause. I
know you. And so do they. They know
how to draw on girls like you.
Girls without money, without
prospects that want things to be
better. They primp and they preen
and they fluff you and tell you
that you are the foot soldiers of
the cause. But you’re only fodder
for a battle that none of you can
win. I am offering you a lifeline.
STEED slides a business card out of his wallet and presses it
into her hand. MAUD, forced to take the card, clenches it
reluctantly in her hand.
STEED (CONT’D)
Take it.

EDITH
Now ladies. I ask you to remain
vigilant when coming and going. We
know we are being watched but
hopefully they will not expect to
find us here. I recognise the
militant path may not be for all of
you but, well, all I ask is for you
to make your decision now. Anyone
who doesn’t want to stay may leave.
I need only those who can give
their full commitment. There will
be no judgement.

MAUD goes to help, watching EDITH busying herself, pulling
out a map of London from a large bag, with renewed verve.
EDITH (CONT’D)
Now. I have marked the map. The
Pillar boxes are red. The telegraph
wires are green.
EDITH lays the map out on a table, smoothing out the creasesEDITH (CONT’D)
We shall cut into the heart of

vital that no life is harmed during

voice, quickly hiding papers she and MISS WITHERS are looking
at. HUGH, stacking shelves, turns, unsettled on seeing STEED
with WALSOPSTEED
That’s a lot of worming tablets, Mr
Ellyn.
HUGH
One of life’s great parasites,
Inspector Steed.
STEED catches on this - clocking HUGH’s quiet contempt.
STEED
Is your wife in?

(to STEED)
Er, Mastitis.
MISS WITHERS pulls on her shirt, begins to button it.
STEED
You’re a wet nurse now, Miss
Withers?
MISS WITHERS wavers, looks away.
STEED‘s eyes silently search the room, travelling over tiny
details as EDITH packs away the medicine left from ‘treating’
MISS WITHERS.
EDITH
Shall we get this over with?
EDITH reaches for her keysEDITH (CONT’D)
You have searched before and found
nothing, but I am happy to comply
again.
STEED
You’re a very clever woman Mrs
Ellyn. I’ll give you that. The way
you seduce these women, draw them
in, train them in destruction.

MISS WITHERS now dressed, makes to exit. EDITH catches her
eye on the way out.
POLICE OFFICER (O.S.)
You’re under arrest Mrs Withers I’d
advise you not to struggle.

Miss Withers will get six months at
least. I can do a few weeks, Edith,
butEDITH
What are you saying? This is not
the time to stand down. No, we push
on. Capitalise on the press
interest.
VIOLET
The press do nothing but scorn and
mock us.
EDITH
They scorn and mock us because they
feel our threat.
VIOLET wavers, EDITH’s eyes follow her gaze to ALICE who
waits nearby, hair awry and a little distracted.
They affect casual conversation with one another.
EDITH (CONT’D)
(hushed)
Mrs Haughton.
ALICE
Ladies.
EDITH takes a long look around.

65.
EDITH
Have you got the information I
asked for?
ALICE
Lloyd George’s summer house is not
yet completed. He was complaining
about it at dinner just the other
night. It’s being built next to the
golf course at Walton-on-the-Hill,
paid for by the owner of The News
of the World.
EDITH
(hushed)
Invaluable information, thank you.
VIOLET darts a look of concern to MAUD and EDITH.
VIOLET
Edith, come here.
She leads EDITH away. MAUD goes to follow.
ALICE
(interrupting)
Mrs Watts. How is your son?
MAUD
It’s his birthday tomorrow.
ALICE nods, smiles, clearly on the edge, absently watching
SCHOOLBOYS playing across the grass.
ALICE
I am so sorry for you... I trusted
in my husband... and this
Government. I was wrong.
(faltering)
I have to go.
ALICE leaves, disappearing across the park. MAUD catches up
to VIOLET and EDITH deep in conversationVIOLET
(hushed)
Please just listen to me Edith. A

far.
EDITH
(hushed)
Why too far? It’s unoccupied, it is

Your commitment, Edith...I have
always known you would take it as

understandVIOLET grabs MAUD’s hand, pulling it to her belly. MAUD
wavers, with realisationMAUD
Oh Vi.
VIOLET
I can’t care for the ones I’ve got.
MAUD hesitates, sees the tears in VIOLET’s eyes and pulls her
into an embrace.
MAUD
When are you due?
VIOLET
Summer. Oh Maud I’m so tired.

We have no family Maud. No one to

SONNY
Say your goodbyes and let him go.
MRS DRAYTON reaches for George’s shoulder. MAUD shames her
with a look, furiously batting her hand away.

SONNY looks away, hating himself. MAUD with desperate
helpless realisation, sinks to the floor. GEORGE puts his
hands on her face, trying to blot her falling tears.
MAUD, hand shaking, holds out the presentMAUD
Open your present.
She helps him, struggling with the paper untilShe pulls out a tiny toy elephant, pushing it into his hand,
down on her knees now, meeting him eye to eyeMAUD (CONT’D)

SONNY, overwhelmed, goes to touch her, hold her, fighting
back his own mounting despair.
MAUD
What have you done?
MAUD hurls herself at SONNY, hitting him, slapping him, hard
across the face. SONNY, reaches out, tries to hold her.

STEED makes his way down the hall and enters a meeting room,
where BENEDICT waits for him.
BENEDICT
When women attack the home of a
government minister we have reached
a state of anarchy we can no longer
ignore. This has to stop. The press
can only be tamed so long. They
grow more and more interested in
these damned women whilst we in
government must try and quash every
new story.
BENEDICT slams a newspaper into STEED’s chest, the headline
clear on the front page - PANKHURST FACES PRISON SENTENCE AS
SHE CLAIMS RESPONSIBILITY FOR BOMBING OF LLOYD GEORGE HOUSE.
BENEDICT (CONT’D)
Pankhurst claims responsibility for
the bombing and faces prison while
the real culprits go free. She’s
going to milk every ounce of
attention she can in prison.
On STEED, bracing himself.
STEED
We’ve made some key arrests.
BENEDICT
Punish those responsible. In
whatever way you can.

Then why am I here?
STEED
Oh you’ll be charged for illegal
meetings if for nothing else.
SILENCE-

74.
STEED (CONT’D)
You know there was a housekeeper on
her way back when the bomb went
off? She forgot her gloves. If she
was two minutes later - what would
that have done for your cause?
Violence doesn’t discern. It takes
the innocent and the guilty. What
gives you the right to put that
woman’s life at risk?
MAUD
What gave you the right to stand in
the middle of a riot and watch
women beaten and do nothing? You’re
a hypocriteSTEED
I uphold the law.
MAUD
The law means nothing to me. I’ve
had no say in making the law.
MAUD at last looks at him, eyes glistening with defianceSTEED
That’s an excuse, it’s all we have.
MAUD
We break windows. We burn things.
Because War is the only language
that men listen to. ‘Cause you’ve
beaten us and betrayed us and
there’s nothing else left.
STEED
Then there’s nothing left but to
stop you.
MAUD
What are you gonna do? Lock us all
up? We’re in every home, we’re half
the human race, you can’t stop us
all.

his horse and wishing a smiling JOCKEY ‘Good luck’.
MAUD

A small beat as they take him in. A flash of Suffrage colour,
a flag clenched in MAUD’s hand, hidden in her pocket.
EMILY
Now.
They press forward.
CLOSE ON MAUD’s POV. VOICES. LAUGHTER. A BLUR of WHITE NOISE.

The ELEGANT RACEGOERS and BOOKIES, FACES CONTORTED, LOST IN

them on either side of the racetrack.
Above in the Royal Box, the KING is quickly hurried away.
The racetrack swamped with RACEGOERS, RACE OFFICIALS crowding
around EMILY’s body. EMILY’s suffrage flag trodden into the
ground.
A SWIRL of PHOTOGRAPHERS all around.
MAUD pushing her way towards EMILY’s broken bodyThe SWELL of PEOPLE, SHOUTINGOn MAUD, suddenly swept back as MEN lift EMILY onto a
stretcher. Someone picks up the crumpled, bloodstained
suffrage flag next to Emily.
She turns, wrapping her coat tightly around herself, and sees

past him.
Steed looks on, letting her go.

changes path and heads down the street towards the laundry.
She breaks into a run.
INT. LAUNDRY. BETHNAL GREEN. 1913. DAY.

lookMAGGIE hesitates, then crosses the floor towards MAUDMAGGIE

EXT. DISUSED CHURCH. BETHNAL GREEN. 1913. NIGHT.
MAUD lights a candle. Opening the book EMILY gave her, she
considers the list of names on the inside cover, then begins
to read.
MAUD V/O
The woman wanderer goes forth to
seek the land of freedom. “How am I
to get there?” Reason answers:
“There is one way, and one way
only.
EXT. TENEMENT. NR MAUD’S HOUSE. BETHNAL GREEN. 1913. DAY.
The sun shining through linen hung on washing lines. A WOMAN
peels potatoes with her daughter on their doorstep.
MAUD V/O
Down the banks of labour. Through
the waters of suffering. There is
no other.
MAUD walking down the street, deep in her own thoughts.
MAUD V/O (CONT’D)
The woman, having discarded all to
which she’d formally clung cries
out.

For what do I go to this far land
which no one has ever reached? I am
alone. I am utterly alone.”
A sound, and MAUD looks up-

Suffragette newspaper.
EDITH
It’s in every paper. They say
thousands will line the streets.

a smile on this MAUD

that.

heart.

each saucer. VIOLET’s YOUNGEST DAUGHTER, tails them, laying
out teaspoons on each saucer.
The FAR OFF SOUND OF CROWDS GROWING CLOSER.
VIOLET hesitates on seeing MAUD, watching VIOLET’s YOUNGEST
DAUGHTER laying out of the last teaspoon.
VIOLET
It’s almost one o’clock Maggie, get
your gloves and help Mrs Ellyn.
The room slowly drains of SUFFRAGETTES.
ON VIOLET watching her MAUDMAUD turns, hesitates, sees VIOLET watching her.
VIOLET smiles, with quiet pride. Then heads off after Maggie,
leaving MAUD alone.
MAUD straightens her hat, watching the women outside the
window.
MAUD V/O
And reason said to her: “Silence.
What do you hear?” And she said: “I
hear the sound of feet. A thousand
times ten thousands, and thousands
and thousands and they beat this
way.”
