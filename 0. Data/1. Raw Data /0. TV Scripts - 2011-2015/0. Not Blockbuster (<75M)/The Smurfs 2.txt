A STORYBOOK opens and unfolds a POP-UP DIORAMA OF SMURF
VILLAGE.
NARRATOR SMURF (V.O.)
Once upon a time in Smurf Village,
happy Smurfs were going about their
happy lives completely unaware that
not too far away...
The PAGE TURNS, unfolding GARGAMEL’S CASTLE..
NARRATOR SMURF (V.O.)
...the evil wizard - Gargamel - was
concocting a diabolical plan.
A BLUE HAND pulls a tab and a 2D cut-out of GARGAMEL appears.
The MUSIC GETS VERY LOUD AND OMINOUS.
NARRATOR SMURF (V.O.)
The kind of diabolical plan that
always is followed by a diabolical
laugh. And that plan echoed fear
through the mushroom homes of the
Smurfs.
PULL BACK TO REVEAL NARRATOR SMURF looking annoyed. He turns
to THE BAND OF SMURFS. Everyone has a musical instrument
except for CRAZY SMURF who is playing his trumpet-mouth.
NARRATOR SMURF
Guys, guys. If you drown out the
narrator, Smooth Smurf, no one’s
gonna have any idea what’s going
on.
The band leader, SMOOTH, responds.
SMOOTH
(deep baritone voice)
That’s cool. We’ll just give you a
groove, something bluesy.
ALT:
SMOOTH
We’ll just drop it down on the
downbeat, double the bass over the
melody and kick it back. Cool as a
snow cone in January.
NARRATOR
(a beat)
I-I have no idea what you just
said.

SMOOTH
We’ll keep it down.
(ALT)
You shoulda called Background Music
if you wanted something soft. But
we’ll bring it down.
The band quiets down. The Narrator clears his throat and
continues as we return to the pop up book. The tab moves
back and forth as Gargamel “speaks”...
NARRATOR SMURF (DOING GARGAMEL)
“I am making my own creation - an
irresistible girl - to infiltrate
their village and betray the
Smurrfs.”
The PAGE TURNS and we see Smurfette (with black hair). A
cutout of a PAINTBRUSH SLIDES over the picture pulling an
overlay into place that turns Smurfette blue.

NARRATOR SMURF (V.O.)
The Smurfs found Gargamel’s
creation and brought her back to
their Village, where her wild and
naughty nature wreaked havoc.

The PAGE TURNS. We see Smurfette in the village, knocking
over Painter’s ladder, stomping on Brainy’s glasses, etc.
NARRATOR SMURF (V.O.)
The Smurfs wanted her gone. But
Papa Smurf saw the good in her.
The PAGE TURNS, unfolding a scene of PAPA’S MUSHROOM with
anxious Smurfs waiting outside.
NARRATOR SMURF
With love, kindness, playful jokes,
more love, delicious fruit pies,
long walks, and, of course, a
secret magical formula, he turned
her into... Smurfette, the darling
of Smurf Village.
A BLUE HAND pulls a tab. The door to Papa’s mushroom opens
revealing the cardboard cutout of SMURFETTE, now BLONDE.

SMURF VILLAGE - POND
PULL BACK FROM THE BOOK TO FIND -- all the SMURFS huddled
around it; rapt as Narrator Smurf turns the next page.
NARRATOR SMURF
It was a day we will never forget.
The day our Smurfette was reborn.
Narrator Smurf motions upward. All the Smurfs look up to a
cliff just above the POND. SMURFETTE steps into view, her
smile beaming. She extends her arms and leaps -- a perfect
triple flip with a twist - and plunges into the water.
NARRATOR SMURF
And the Smurf family had grown one
bigger...
Smurfs applaud as they stand and gather around the pond,
waiting for her to emerge. She rises up from the water (her
back to us) She shakes her hair like a shampoo ad, then
dramatically turns revealing HER FACE IS SINISTER...
NARRATOR SMURF
...until....

CRAZY, sending him flying toward camera, HORN BLOWING.

NARRATOR SMURF
...poor Smurfette is haunted by
horrible dreams of the “who am I?”

NARRATOR SMURF
(exiting)
Masking his disappointment, our
velvety-voiced Narrator departs to
see if any other Smurfs need
redundant Smurfentary on their
every move...

And then, Narrator Smurf realized
that he wanted to be in this story
more and continued talking. Just
then (acting frightened)
- a giant S-P-I-D-E-R landed on

Papa, every year on my birthday, I
have these horrible dreams about
where I come from -- and it makes
me wonder who I really am.
PAPA
And every year I tell you. It
doesn’t matter where you came from.

EXT. SMURF VILLAGE - SECONDS LATER

Preparations are underway for Smurfette’s SURPRISE BIRTHDAY
PARTY. All the Smurfs sing the La-La song as they go about
their tasks.
CLUMSY
Wait, because it’s Smurfette’s
birthday, let’s sing the birthday
song!
All the Smurfs nod in agreement and sing. It’s the same La-la
song.
GROUCHY is hanging a GARGAMEL PINATA from a tree branch.
GUTSY
A little lower, Grouchy. I want to
be able to whack him in the
smurfberries.
BAKER comes running up to his CAKE, pissed.

How ‘bout you, Vanity? You can

Surreptitiously Vanity sneaks a peak in his mirror.

Then she sees a SMURF holding a clipboard and gets HOPEFUL.
SMURFETTE
Oh hey, Party Planner Smurf.
Anything... “fun” coming up that I
should know about?
PARTY PLANNER SMURF
Nope. Nothing ‘til Smurf Break.
It’s going to be wild! I’ll put you

Nope. Nothing ‘til St.

Smurfette is crushed.
FARMER
You know, occasionally it’s good to
have a little alone time.
All the other Smurfs chime in “Yeah, go on!” “It’s fine!” “We
don’t need you here!” Smurfette drops her head and walks
towards the forest. HANDY turns to another Smurf.

As Smurfette wanders into the forest, she mumbles to
herself...
SMURFETTE
Nobody wants me.
NARRATOR SMURF
And with that, Smurfette walked
into the woods, alone, cold, and
sad.
SMURFETTE
I’m sorry Narrator Smurf, can I
just be alone with my feelings?
NARRATOR SMURF
I’m sorry! Just trying to help the
people understand your feelings.
Apparently nobody wants any
narration. Well, I’ll just be on
the other side of the forest
narrating the lives of chipmunks.
Narrator Smurf leaves.
SMURFETTE
Jeesh...maybe I really don’t belong
here.
ALTS:
SMURFETTE
Well if this is where [Papa thinks]
I belong, people have strange way
of showing it. Nobody seems to
want me around.

Alright Smurfs, listen up. I saved

Are we having a birthday party for
Smurfette?
Smurf hands SHOOT UP - “Me”, “I’ll go”, “Smurf me!” etc.
PAPA
Now, now, Smurfs. I only had water
enough for 9 crystals. That’s me
and three others round trip, plus
Smurfette on the way home.
GROUCHY
Assuming you can find her - which
is doubtful.
CLUMSY
That’s not a very smurfy attitude,

“impossible.” That’s progress for

I’ll need courage, strength, and
intelligence. So... Gutsy, Hefty,
Brainy - you’ll smurf with me.
A Smurf in the front row raises his hand.

A lone MIME, doing the “Glass Box,” fails to kneel, and
continues his routine. Gargamel ZAPS him into an ACTUAL

I’ve kept to myself, something she

her into a Smurf... well, it wasn’t
a complete transformation.
I worked my strongest magic, but
she’s still Gargamel’s creation.
Patrick listens as Papa bares his deepest fear.
PAPA
She’s a Smurf only so long as she
chooses to be. She isn’t aware of
that. But if she chooses
otherwise... well...
(shuddering at thought)
Do you think I’ve done enough?
PATRICK
Are you kidding? Gargamel just
made her, but you... you made her
what she is. You stepped in and
loved her as your very own. No one
asked you to, but you did. Because
you knew she needed you. And
that’s...

That’s a pretty special kind of
love. She’s way too smart not to
see that.

where she came from -- I love her
just the same.

NARRTOR
And so, as the band once again
tries to drown out our everimportant narrator, the Smurfs
celebrate the return of their
beloved Smurfette, the growth of
their family, and the comfort of
knowing that their age-old foe,
Gargamel, is trapped a world away powerless to harm them, ever, ever
again.

Gargamel is finally FALLING BACK from the stratosphere. It
looks like he’s heading for the Reflecting Pool at the
Trocadero. He POINTS his wand and SHOOTS DOWNWARD to try and
slow his fall. The BEAM OF ENERGY HITS THE WATER and FORMS
a... is that a PORTAL??? Gargamel SLAMS INTO THE HOLE - and
disappears.

Azrael CHUCKLES to himself and turns to the portal...
AZRAEL
Are you dead?
Thinking he’s safe, he YAWNS and readies to sleep...
Suddenly a GIANT BLUE ENERGY CLAW REACHES OUT OF THE VORTEX,
GRABS AZRAEL, and PULLS HIM IN! Rrrrrrr!!

He sayeth the sun revolves around
the earth! Get him!

Hey Bottocelli! Why don’t you paint
her on a half a shell?
END CREDITS
The music ends, and OVER CREDITS showing the Smurfs - a NEW
SONG begins (maybe even one Katy Perry has so kindly taken
the time from her busy schedule to write for the film because
she’s so nice, and pretty, and smart, and talented).
THE END
