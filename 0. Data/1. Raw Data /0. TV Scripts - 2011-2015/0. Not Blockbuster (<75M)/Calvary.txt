INT. CONFESSIONAL - DAY
FATHER JAMES LAVELLE, fifties, is idly reading Moby Dick.
Dressed in an old-fashioned black soutane. He hears
someone enter the confessional. Marks his page. Waits -MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
I first tasted semen when I was
seven years old.
HOLD CLOSE on LAVELLE.
MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
Nothing to say?
LAVELLE
It’s certainly a startling opening
line.
MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
What is that, irony?
LAVELLE
I’m sorry, let’s start again.
Are you...What do you...What do
you want to say to me? I’m here to
listen to whatever you have to say.
MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
I was raped by a priest when I was
seven years old. Orally and anally,
as they say in the court reports.
This went on for five years.
Every other day for five years.
I bled a lot, as you can imagine.
I bled a terrible amount.
LAVELLE
(after a pause)
Have you spoken to anyone about-MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
I’m speaking to you now.
LAVELLE
I mean, have you sought professional
help?
MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
Why, so I could learn how to cope?
So I could learn how to live with it?
Maybe I don’t want to cope. Maybe I
don’t want to learn how to live with it.
LAVELLE
Why don’t you make a formal complaint?
You can testify-(CONTINUED)

MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
The man’s dead.

There is silence for a moment.
LAVELLE
I don’t know what to say to you.
I have no answer for you, I’m sorry.
MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
What good would it do anyway, if he
were still alive? What’d be the point
in killing the bastard? That’d be no
news. There’s no point in killing a
bad priest. But killing a good one?
That’d be a shock, now. They wouldn’t
know what to make of that.
(pause)
I’m going to kill you, Father.
I’m going to kill you ‘cause you’ve
done nothing wrong. I’m going to kill
you ‘cause you’re innocent.
(pause)
Not right now, though. I’ll give you
enough time to put your house in order.
Make your peace with God. Sunday week,
let’s say. I’ll meet you down on the
beach there. Down by the water there.
(with a laugh)
Killing a priest on a Sunday.
That’ll be a good one.
(pause)
Do you not have anything to say to
me, Father?

*

LAVELLE
Not right now, no. But I’m sure I’ll
think of something. By Sunday week.
There is a pause. Then the MAN laughs. The confessional
door is heard opening and closing. LAVELLE waits.

INT. SACRISTY - DAY
TITLE -- “Sunday”.
LAVELLE and MICHEÁL enter. MICHEÁL slouching.
LAVELLE
A little too much wine in the
chalice again, there, Micheál.
MICHEÁL
Sorry, Father.
LAVELLE
(taking off his chasuble)
I’m wondering is this some kind of
ploy on your behalf.
(CONTINUED)

4.

CONTINUED:

MICHEÁL
A ploy, Father?
LAVELLE
(untying his cincture)
A ploy, Micheál. I’ve noticed my
stocks of booze appear to be
somewhat diminished of late.
I’m wondering is this some kind of
ploy you’re working to cover up
for the wine you’ve been imbibing
on the q.t.
MICHEÁL
I have no idea what you are talking
about.

LAVELLE removes his stole. Studying MICHEÁL all the while.
MICHEÁL
Father Leary noticed nothing amiss.

*

LAVELLE
Father Leary does not know you as
well as I do, Micheál. I’d say he
may well underestimate the depths
of your Machiavellian chicanery.

*

MICHEÁL
Can I go now, Father?

*

LAVELLE
What’s the hurry? Have they called
a meeting at Mafia Headquarters?
They look blankly at one another.
LAVELLE
On your way.
10

10

INT. RECTORY (KITCHEN) - DAY
FATHER LEARY is pouring the tea. LAVELLE reading the
Sunday newspapers.
LEARY
The things you hear in confession
these days, it’s depressing.

*
*
*

LAVELLE
You have to detach yourself from
it. We’re here to provide solace.
Your personal feelings don’t come
into it.

(CONTINUED)

5.
10

CONTINUED:

10
LEARY
I know that. What d’you take me
for? It’s very difficult, though.
The mess people make of their lives.

*

LAVELLE
What’s the problem? Without going
into details, obviously.
LEARY
Your one with the big black eye on
her, have you seen her?

*

LAVELLE
Veronica Brennan. I have, yeah.
LEARY
She’s an odd one. The things she
comes out with. It’s like she’s
trying to drag you down into the
muck. D’you know what felching is?

*

LAVELLE
I do know what felching is, yeah.
LEARY
I had to look it up.

*

LAVELLE
This is you not going into details
is it?
LEARY
Oh sorry. Anyway, whatever’s going
on with her it’s obviously all gotten
out of hand and she’s being knocked
around now.

*

LAVELLE
Well if you speak to her she’ll raise
holy hell and say it was on the basis
of something she said to you in the
confessional.
LEARY
I know, I know. We can’t have that.
She’ll get me excommunicated, the cow.

*

LAVELLE
I’ll have a word with her. Jack as
well. Part of my pastoral duties and
what-have-you, nothing to do with her
confession or anything. See what’s
going on.
LEARY
And that coloured fella, the Ugandan?
He’s one of her lovers, I think.

LAVELLE
Simon’s from the Ivory Coast.
LEARY
Right, right. I knew it was that,
or Guyana. One of those African
countries.

*

LAVELLE
Guyana is in South America.
LEARY
I don’t think so, now, Father.
I was always pretty good at the
auld geography.

*

LAVELLE glances at him. Sips his tea.

EXT. BEACH - DAY

CLOSE on the skirts of LAVELLE’s black soutane as he walks
across the sandy beach. He pauses at the water’s edge and
looks out.

12

EXT. SAND DUNES - DAY

CLOSE on a picture -- a fair representation in charcoal of
the beach scene, but with the addition of two black
figures in a corner of the paper.
REVERSE-SHOT -- LAVELLE looking over MICHEÁL’s shoulder,
impressed. MICHEÁL ignoring him as he scratches away.
LAVELLE
Not bad. Surprisingly.
I was expecting a daub.
MICHEÁL
I was thinking, though, Father,
what if I was no good at all?
LAVELLE
How do you mean?
MICHEÁL
I mean, what if there’s something
you really want to do, or something
you really want to be, but you’re
no good at it at all?
LAVELLE
That’s most people’s lives, Micheál.
Sadly.
He looks up at the beach. Looks back at the picture.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

12
LAVELLE
Who are those two lads supposed to be?
MICHEÁL
Don’t know. I’ve been reading these
ghost stories. Maybe it’s got something to do with that. Spooky.

LAVELLE looks at MICHEÁL. Pats him on the head.
13

13

INT. LAVELLE’S ROOM - NIGHT
LAVELLE enters, turning on the light, closing the door.
The room is spare -Wooden bed, where his Golden Retriever, Bruno, is
sleeping. Grey wool blankets.
Whitewashed walls without adornment, save for a crucifix.
Cupboard. Writing desk with a large white seashell. Two
chairs, one at the desk, one beside the bed.
He tosses Moby Dick onto the bed. Bruno yawns. He sits on
the chair beside the bed. Thinks.
Removes one of his black leather Oxfords. Then the other.
Pauses, the second shoe still in his hand. Thinking.

Puts down the shoe beside its comrade. Gets up and goes to
the desk. Takes off his clerical collar. Pauses.
He looks out the window over the writing desk.
14

14

EXT. SLIGO CATHEDRAL - DAY
TITLE -- “Monday”.
The cathedral is an imposing structure. A handsome modern
edifice, with a massive tower.

15

INT. BISHOP’S OFFICE - DAY

BISHOP GARRET MONTGOMERY is eating a large cream scone the
size of a baby’s head. A silver tea-set in front of him.
His office opulently furnished and decorated.
MONTGOMERY
So do you know who it was?
REVERSE SHOT -- LAVELLE seated opposite. Bereft of tea.
LAVELLE
Yes, Your Excellency.
I know who it was.
MONTGOMERY
Do you know him well?
(CONTINUED)

9.
15

CONTINUED:

15
LAVELLE
Well enough.
MONTGOMERY
Knowing this man as you do, do you
think it was an idle threat?
LAVELLE
I don’t know. I’m not sure.
MONTGOMERY
“Not sure” means it’s possible.
LAVELLE
Yes. I suppose.

MONTGOMERY puts down the scone. Licks his fingers.
MONTGOMERY
You didn’t grant him absolution,
obviously.
LAVELLE
He didn’t ask for it.
MONTGOMERY
Well there you have it. The man is
not penitent. There is no contrition.
He’s threatening to commit a crime,
not asking for forgiveness for one.
The inviolability of the sacramental
seal does not apply.
LAVELLE
You’re saying I should go to the
police?
MONTGOMERY
I’m not saying anything. The choice
is yours.
16

EXT. SLIGO TRAIN STATION (PLATFORM) - DAY

16

A train exits the station to reveal FIONA LAVELLE. Thirty,
attractive, her wrists bandaged. A suitcase at her feet.
[Note: she has an English accent.]
LAVELLE appears.
LAVELLE
Don’t tell me. You made the classic
error.
FIONA
You’re supposed to cut down, not
across.

(CONTINUED)

10.
16

CONTINUED:

LAVELLE
(after a pause)
I don’t know what else to say.

They look blankly at one another. LAVELLE opens his arms.
FIONA stands up. They embrace.
17

EXT. SLIGO TRAIN STATION - DAY

CLOSE on a little red convertible sports car. Bruno in the
passenger seat. He barks.
REVERSE SHOT -- FIONA and LAVELLE looking at the car.
LAVELLE
Always wanted a fast car. A red one.
FIONA
I thought you’d already had your
mid-life crisis.
LAVELLE shoots her a glance.
18

EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY
The sports car crests a hill and zips by, LAVELLE at the
wheel, FIONA beside him, Bruno in the middle.

INT. LYNCH’S BAR - DAY
MILO HERLIHY, twenties, polka-dotted bow-tie, an oddly
blank look about him. FRANK HARTE, a good-looking older
man with a clinical air. Guinnesses in front of them.
HERLIHY
You’re a very nice-looking young
woman.
REVERSE SHOT -- FIONA and LAVELLE waiting for their
drinks. FIONA laughs, glancing at LAVELLE, who smiles.
FIONA
Thank you. I like your bow-tie.
HERLIHY
It’s got polka-dots.

(CONTINUED)

11.
21

CONTINUED:

21
LAVELLE
This is my daughter, Fiona, Milo.
She’s over from London.
HERLIHY
You’re having me on.
LAVELLE
I’m not having you on. What are
you on about?
HERLIHY
You’re a priest!
LAVELLE
I was married before I became a
priest. My wife and I had a child,
Fiona. My wife died. And after that
I joined the priesthood.
HERLIHY
You can do that, can you?
HARTE
It would appear so.
(noticing FIONA’s bandages)
Don’t tell me. You made the classic
error.
LAVELLE
I’ve already done that gag, Frank.
HARTE
You’re supposed to cut down-LAVELLE
I’ve already done it, I said.
LYNCH (O.S.)
Now, now.

BRENDAN LYNCH appears with a Coca-Cola bottle and glass,
and a double whiskey. Forty, handsome. Hands the Coke to
LAVELLE, the whiskey to FIONA -LYNCH
A drop of the hard stuff for
yourself, and a generous serving
of the auld water of life to
this beautiful and yet troubled-FIONA
Oh fuck off.
LYNCH looks blankly at FIONA. She takes a sip of the
whiskey as she moves towards a table. LAVELLE following.

(CONTINUED)

12.
21

CONTINUED:

21
LYNCH
You have an exceedingly dirty
mouth. I like that in a hoor.
LAVELLE
Brendan. Now’s not the time.

LYNCH looks from FIONA to LAVELLE.
LYNCH
Whatever you say, Father.
You’re the boss.
22

22

INT. LYNCH’S BAR - LATER
LAVELLE and FIONA in a little nook. FIONA drinks her
whiskey. LAVELLE pushes his Coke bottle around.
FIONA
How’s that working out for you?
LAVELLE
Oh I haven’t been out on the tear
in a good while.
FIONA
So you say.
LAVELLE
Ah no, I’ve been a very good lad.
And don’t change the subject.
FIONA
What was the subject?
LAVELLE
You know what the subject was.
FIONA
Oh Daddy, a man, a man. What else.
LAVELLE
It’s getting to be a habit, honey.
FIONA
I know. Pathetic. Can’t do anything
right.

She sips her whiskey. LAVELLE takes one of her hands. Rubs
the bandage with a thumb.
LAVELLE
“Razors pain you.”
FIONA
(looking at him)
“Rivers are damp.”
(CONTINUED)

13.
22

CONTINUED:

22
LAVELLE
“Acids stain you. And drugs cause
cramp.”
FIONA
“Guns aren’t lawful. Nooses give.”
LAVELLE
“Gas smells awful.”
FIONA/LAVELLE
“You might as well live.”

They smile.
LYNCH studies them from the other end of the bar.
23

23

EXT. CHURCH - DAY
CLOSE on various angles of the church’s architecture -windows, steeple, etc. -- emphasising its simple,
unpretentious nature.
FIONA (O.S.)
Back-to-basics, is what you’re
saying.
LAVELLE (O.S.)
Simplicity. Lack of ostentation.
That kind of thing.
LEARY (O.S.)
All your father’s idea. His baby.

*
*

LAVELLE, FIONA and LEARY are standing to the front and
sides of the church. LEARY carrying a box of toys.

*
*

LEARY
We couldn’t go on with the old
one anyways. Falling to pieces.
Liable to get someone killed.

*

FIONA
It’s a good gimmick, I suppose.
LAVELLE
It’s not a gimmick.
FIONA
I’m sorry, I didn’t mean...
LEARY
They’d call it a rebranding in the
advertising world.

*

(CONTINUED)

14.
23

CONTINUED:

23
FIONA
I suppose you are a corporate entity,
if you look at it in one way.
LEARY
It’s the only way to look at it.
We provide a product and a service
and that’s all there is to it.

*

He strolls away. FIONA smiles wryly. LAVELLE gives a shake
of the head. Glances up proudly at the church.
24

24

EXT. BRENNANS’ HOUSE - DAY

VERONICA BRENNAN, thirties, wearing shades, pegging up the
linen. White sheets fluttering in the wind. She looks up -LAVELLE at the other side of the line. His black soutane
fluttering in the wind.
LAVELLE
Nice shades.
VERONICA
Do they make me look like Jackie O?
LAVELLE
Not really, no.
VERONICA smiles. Raises the glasses up on her forehead.
VERONICA
This what you came to gawp at?
Nasty, hah?
LAVELLE
It’s an interesting colour.
VERONICA lowers the shades and continues with the laundry.
VERONICA
They say you can find beauty in
everything, if you look hard enough.
LAVELLE
I’d say you can find beauty in
most things, but not everything.
That’s nonsense.
VERONICA
Sure what would I know? I’m just
an auld washerwoman.
The washing that she’s hanging on the line now seems to be
comprised solely of items of lingerie.
VERONICA
See anything you fancy?
(CONTINUED)

15.
24

CONTINUED:

24
LAVELLE
If you don’t want to talk to me,
that’s fine. I’m not here to compel
you to do anything.
VERONICA
You never know, Father, maybe I’d
like to be compelled. Maybe I’d
enjoy it.
LAVELLE
I’ll have a word with Jack.
See what he has to say for himself.
VERONICA
The Grand Inquisitor, hah? Go on
ahead for yourself so. I’m sure
he’ll be only too pleased to have
someone else to bore the ears off.
I stopped listening to his auld
shite a long time ago.
LAVELLE
That’s how it is, is it? I didn’t
realise.
VERONICA
You thought we were another Grace
Kelly and Prince Rainier?
LAVELLE
That wasn’t a very happy marriage,
so it’s not a great analogy.

VERONICA looks at him. Laughs.
VERONICA
Y’know that’s what I’ve always liked
about you, Father. You’re just a
little too sharp for this parish.
25

25

INT. BRENNAN’S BUTCHERS - DAY
A meat cleaver comes down hard on a rack of ribs. JACK
BRENNAN, forty, in a bloody apron, chopping up the meat.
BRENNAN
(to his ASSISTANT)
--Mad fella altogether. Decapitated
the two of them. Blood all over the
place there was.
He chuckles and looks up -LAVELLE has entered.
BRENNAN
Father.

(CONTINUED)

16.
25

CONTINUED:

25
LAVELLE
Jack.
(glancing at the ASSISTANT,
who is serving a CUSTOMER)
Could I have a word in private?
BRENNAN
(nervous laugh)
Sounds ominous. Where’s Johnny
Cochran when you need him, hah?

26

26

INT. MEAT FREEZER - DAY
Carcasses of pigs, and sides of beef, hanging from hooks.
The icy breath of LAVELLE and BRENNAN floating between
them as they converse -BRENNAN
(giggling)
Hope we don’t get locked in. We’ll
have to make love to keep warm.
LAVELLE
I had a word, there, with Veronica,
Jack.
BRENNAN
You were over to the house?
Is everything alright?
LAVELLE
Everything’s fine. I mean, no, it’s
not fine. Mass on Sunday, with the
shades and everything-BRENNAN
Oh that.
LAVELLE
Yes, that. Have you been laying into
her or what’s going on?
BRENNAN
Ah that wasn’t me, now. That was
that black fella she’s been seeing.
Coloured fella, I mean, sorry.
Didn’t mean to be racist, slip of
the tongue.
LAVELLE
You’re saying he beats her up?
BRENNAN
Well don’t quote me on it. I mean,
that’s what I’m assuming, like.
She talks in riddles half the time,
I can’t get any sense out of her.
(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

17.
26

CONTINUED:

26
BRENNAN (CONT'D)
I think she’s bi-polar, or lactoseintolerant, one of the two. I never
know where I am with her anymore.
I’m glad to have her off my hands,
to be honest with ya.
LAVELLE
Even if this new fella’s knocking
her about?
BRENNAN
Sure what’s that got to do with me?
Not everyone can carry the weight
of the world, Father.
LAVELLE
What about your marriage? The oaths
you took?
BRENNAN
(with a laugh)
The oaths I took!

He sees the look LAVELLE gives him and stops laughing.
BRENNAN
Listen, Father, she’s been a lot
happier since she’s been seeing him,
a lot calmer and more settled down,
like. I’m not under surveillance
any more either, I can reel in home
whatever time I like. So everybody’s
happy. Now where’s the harm?
LAVELLE looks blankly at him.
BRENNAN
Will I cut you a nice side of beef
to be taking home with you, Father?
Freshly slaughtered.
27

27

EXT. GARAGE - DAY
Boots sticking out from underneath a car. The skirts of
LAVELLE’s soutane appear. He nudges a boot with his shoe.
SIMON ASAMOAH glides out on a car trolley.
LAVELLE
Simon.
ASAMOAH
Hello, Father.
(getting up, wiping his
hands on a rag)
I am rather busy today--

18.
27

CONTINUED:

27
LAVELLE
It’s not about my car. It’s about
Mrs Brennan.

ASAMOAH reaches for a Coca-Cola bottle and takes a
swallow.
LAVELLE
You’re her boyfriend?
ASAMOAH
I fuck her from time to time.
Does that make me her boyfriend?
LAVELLE
It does around here.
ASAMOAH
She has a lot of boyfriends, I have
heard.
LAVELLE
Is that right?
ASAMOAH
Do you want me to confess to adultery?
Is that why you are here?
LAVELLE
Somebody beat her up.
ASAMOAH
She told you I beat her up?
LAVELLE
No, she didn’t.
ASAMOAH
Then why are you here?
LAVELLE
Somebody beat her up. It’s either
you or the husband.
ASAMOAH
I do not think Jack beat her up.
He is not the type.
LAVELLE
What is the type?
ASAMOAH takes a pack of cigarettes from his pocket and
lights one, looking out over the garage forecourt.
ASAMOAH
Some of them like to be hit,
you know.
(CONTINUED)

19.
27

CONTINUED:

27
LAVELLE
Who?
ASAMOAH
White women. Irish women. Do not
ask me why. You would have to be
a psychiatrist-LAVELLE
Ah that’s nonsense. A justification
for your own brutality.
ASAMOAH
No, no, they like to be hit.
In certain...situations. They beg
for it, in fact.
LAVELLE
So she got what was coming to her,
did she?
ASAMOAH
I was speaking generally.
LAVELLE
Oh you were speaking generally.
Well I’m speaking specifically.
Don’t do it again.
ASAMOAH
You cannot tell me what to do.
We are not in the Missions now.
LAVELLE
Oh the Missions, right-ASAMOAH
Are you going to chop off my hand
if I disobey you?
LAVELLE
You know your history, that’s grand.
ASAMOAH
I like to read. You probably do not
think that black people-LAVELLE
Yeah, yeah, yeah, black people,
white people, blah, blah, blah.

ASAMOAH looks at him. Flicks his cigarette at him. LAVELLE
flinches, taken aback.
ASAMOAH
Run along now, Father, your sermon
is finished.

INT. CHURCH - DAY

LEARY is preparing the altar. LAVELLE glancing through the
large Bible set for Mass.
LEARY
You’d better watch your step there.

*
*

LAVELLE
Why is that?
LEARY
If it was him who was laying into
her. You’ll have to tread very
carefully there. It’s a very
sensitive area.

*

LAVELLE
You’ll have to explain this one
to me, now, Father, I’m afraid
you’ve lost me completely.
LEARY
Well the Church can’t be seen to
be getting involved in matters of
diversity and the like, d’you know.

*

LAVELLE
You mean, like, what if beating her
up is one of those ethnic rituals
or something? Like when they do
that thing when they shake hands?
LEARY
(after a pause)
You’re mocking me, now, I can tell.

*

LAVELLE looks blankly at LEARY.

*

LEARY
We have to be very circumspect
in those areas, is all I’m saying.

*
*

LAVELLE
I’ll be very circumspect, Father.
Don’t you worry about that.

INT. COTTAGE - DAY

An older man -- GERALD RYAN -- is leaning back in a chair,

An American, slightly bohemian, he wears an old brown
corduroy suit, blue shirt, black boots. Music playing on

He leans forwards over an old manual typewriter. A stack
of manuscript pages next to it. Examines the paragraph he
has just written. Pauses. The sound of an outboard motor
can be heard.
He gets up, using the shillelagh, and goes to a pair of
large wooden shutters. Opens them to reveal -LAVELLE upon a stretch of water in an old white wooden
speedboat propelled by an outboard motor.

EXT. INISHMURRAY ISLAND - DAY
LAVELLE navigates the speedboat to the shoreline of the
island, situated four miles off the coast of Sligo.

He drags the boat onto the shore, next to an old currach.
Hefts the box and tramps up the path to the stone cottage.

INT. COTTAGE - DAY
RYAN has returned to his seat at the typewriter. LAVELLE
appears at the door.
LAVELLE
How is all?
RYAN
At death’s door. You?
LAVELLE
The same. Still using the old typewriter, I see. Bit of an affectation.
RYAN
My whole life has been an affectation.
LAVELLE
That’s one of those lines that sounds
witty but doesn’t actually make much
sense.
RYAN
Caught out again!

LAVELLE crosses to the kitchen table and deposits the box.
LAVELLE
How’s the latest masterpiece coming?
RYAN gets up, struggling with the shillelagh.
RYAN
Better than Cecelia Ahern, but not
as good as Banville.
LAVELLE
Sure you could say that about everybody.
RYAN
What you got for me?
LAVELLE unloads the provisions -- sushi, Maker’s Mark
bourbon, Green & Black’s organic chocolate -RYAN
Ah, the staff of life.
-- and two books: a paperback, Jernigan, by David Gates,
and a hardcover, HHhH, by Laurent Binet.
RYAN smells the hardcover and handles it reverently.
LAVELLE
Need anything else?
RYAN
A gun.
LAVELLE
Hah?
RYAN
A Walther PPK oughtta do it.
James Bond’s weapon of choice.
Old Adolf killed himself with one
in the bunker.
LAVELLE
That’s the plan is it?
RYAN
I’ve no intention of writhing around
in agony for hours on end when the
time comes. Or not knowing who I am
or where I am. I ain’t going out
like that, as the young folks would
have it.
LAVELLE
Romantic nonsense.

God, you’re awful maudlin today,
I must say.

RYAN laughs, pops a piece of the chocolate into his mouth.

INT. LAVELLE’S ROOM - DAY

LAVELLE is at his desk, reading Moby Dick. Bruno asleep on
the bed. There is a knock at the door.
FIONA pops her head in, then enters, closing the door
behind her and leaning against it. She glances around.
FIONA
You don’t have any photos.
LAVELLE
No. I’m in agreement with the Apaches
on that score.
FIONA
The Apaches?
LAVELLE
The Apaches. The Arapaho.
FIONA
The Hunkpapa Sioux!
She laughs. LAVELLE smiles.
FIONA
Not even one of Mum?
LAVELLE
I don’t need a photograph to remember
your mother.
FIONA
Memories fade, though. That’s what’s
so terrible about them.
LAVELLE
No they don’t. Not really.

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
LAVELLE and FIONA are walking briskly up the incline of
the road, Bruno running on in front of them.
FIONA
I should buy a cane.
LAVELLE
It’d suit you. You’re old beyond
your years.
FIONA
Yeah. It’d give me a feeling of...
imperiousness.
She looks at him. They laugh.
LAVELLE
And you could lean on it.
FIONA
I could lean on it. Reflectively.
LAVELLE
Point things out.
FIONA
Club someone to death with it.
LAVELLE
A blunt instrument, yeah.
Who, though?
FIONA
A certain young man from Rathmines.
He glances at her. She is looking at the ground as she
walks.
FIONA
Aren’t all instruments blunt?
LAVELLE
Flugelhorns?
He looks blankly at her. She laughs.

On the road ahead, MICHAEL FITZGERALD appears on a fine
black thoroughbred. Handsome, suave, Forties. He turns the
horse in front of LAVELLE and FIONA.
FITZGERALD
Who’s this now?
LAVELLE
This is my daughter, Fiona.

FITZGERALD
Oh right. Like a French novel or
something. What’s the fella’s name?
Bernanos.
(to FIONA)
Michael Fitzgerald. I bought the
Big House, up the road a-ways there,
beyond.

Fiona nods, unimpressed.
LAVELLE
I haven’t seen you at Mass lately.
I was wondering-FITZGERALD
Haven’t had the time. I’m actually
thinking of building a chapel on the
grounds, y’know like in Brideshead
Revisited? You could pop round then,
freelance, like, save me the trouble.
They look blankly at one another. FIONA pats the horse.
FIONA
Lovely creature.
FITZGERALD
Really expensive, too. Prime horse
flesh.
FIONA looks up at him. He smiles a bright flashing smile.
FITZGERALD
He’s an interesting man, your father.
FIONA
Is that right?
FITZGERALD
A good man. A fine man. No one has a
bad word to say about him. Makes me
wonder what he’s hiding.
FIONA
God, you’re a fucking prick-FITZGERALD
Oh! Feisty!
LAVELLE
Fiona-FITZGERALD
Ah I’m only codding. No offence meant,
as they say. Do me a favour, though,
Father, and swing by the house one
afternoon.

FITZGERALD (CONT'D)

LAVELLE
Really.
FITZGERALD
Yes, really. A financial proposition.
That interests you, doesn’t it?
Sure it’d be a black day altogether
the day the Roman Catholic Church is
no longer interested in money, hah?

He laughs jovially, gives an Edward G. Robinson salute,
and spurs his horse away between them.

EXT. BEACH - SUNSET
LAVELLE and FIONA are walking along the deserted beach.
The waves rolling in. Bruno noses at something in the
sand. They pause, look down -Their POV -- a dead seagull, insects swarming over it.

LAVELLE squats. Extends the gull’s wingspan, examining the
white feathers, curious.
FIONA
Dirty thing.
He lays it back down. Stands. Turns -LAVELLE’s POV -- a FIGURE has appeared at the end of the
beach, lending a sinister aspect to the scene.
LAVELLE strolls on, seemingly unconcerned. FIONA dallies
with Bruno. After a moment, LAVELLE glances back -LAVELLE’s POV -- the FIGURE is approaching.
LAVELLE
Let’s head back.
He quickens his pace. FIONA and Bruno catching up. After a
good few strides, he glances back again -LAVELLE’s POV -- the FIGURE has disappeared.
FIONA
What is it?
LAVELLE scans the horizon. Puzzled, but relieved.
LAVELLE
Nothing.

dances as if he were a little rabbit. STANTON laughs.
STANTON
Is this a police matter, Father?
LAVELLE
No, it’s a personal...a personal
thing.
STANTON
It’s a personal a personal thing.
LEO
You look worried, Fada. My advice?
Take it on the lamaster. You don’t
wanna drop in for the phonus-bolonus
and wind up with a sock in the
kisser. Get me?
LAVELLE looks blankly at LEO.
STANTON
He’s not in the mood, Leo.
LEO
Maybe I can cheer up the old sourpuss. I’ll show ya a good time,
Fada. Good Time Leo, that’s me!
Although it’ll be extra if I let
ya wear the cassock. I know what
you holy-rollers are like when ya

LAVELLE looks blankly at LEO. LEO and STANTON look at each
other and laugh. LEO grabs his leather jacket.
LEO
I’m oudda heah!
He tap-dances out the door.
STANTON
He’s a character, hah?
What’s troubling you, Father?
You seem agitated.
LAVELLE

INT. STUDY - NIGHT
CLOSE on a Webley Revolver, circa 1920, laid out in a
beautiful velvet case.
STANTON
My great-grandfather’s. Said he
took it off one of the Cairo Gang
when they shot them all on Bloody
Sunday. The first Bloody Sunday,
obviously.
LAVELLE
Ever had call to use it?
STANTON
Yeah. I killed a man with it once.
In the Wicklow mountains.
He hefts the gun, sighting along it, straight at LAVELLE.
LAVELLE
What case was that?
STANTON
Ah he was just pissing me off,
like.
LAVELLE is not sure if he’s joking. STANTON hands him the
gun. Passes him a carton of bullets. LAVELLE flips open
the chamber. Loads it.
STANTON
Somebody been threatening you,
Father? What have you been up
to, now?
(with a smirk)
Not you as well, hah?

LAVELLE flips shut the chamber. Sights along the revolver,
straight at STANTON. STANTON looks blankly at him.
STANTON
What did you say you wanted it
for, Father?
LAVELLE
I didn’t say.
He replaces the revolver in the case.
STANTON
I’d say you wanted it for your dog.
The dog’s dying, it’s in pain,
you’re worried you might have to
put it out of its misery one of
these days. Isn’t that right?

Well I can’t argue with that.

STANTON
I had one of those, y’know.
Early on.
LAVELLE
One of what?
STANTON
Paedophile priest. Twenty years ago
now this was, in Dublin. Young girl
made a complaint. A rape.
LAVELLE
What happened?
STANTON
Ah sure, what d’ya think happened?
I arrested the bastard and fortyeight hours later I was packing my
bags and making my way out West.
LAVELLE
They moved you on?
STANTON
Reassigned, yeah.
LAVELLE gets into his car.

FIONA raises the hem of her skirt to her thighs and steps
down into the cool clear water. Bruno watching her.
She paddles out to where LAVELLE is standing in waders,
fly-fishing, the skirt of his soutane floating out over
the water.
FIONA
How long you been at this craic?
LAVELLE
Last coupla years. Supposed to be
therapeutic.
FIONA
Maybe I should take it up.
LAVELLE
Maybe you should.

Have you been seeing anyone,
in London?
FIONA
I’m assuming you mean professionally
rather than-LAVELLE
Ah come on now, let’s stop with all

he senses something, looks round -MILO HERLIHY is standing there, having materialised
seemingly out of nowhere.
LAVELLE
Milo.
HERLIHY
I need to speak to you, Father.
LAVELLE
Take a pew. Literally.
HIGH-ANGLE SHOT -- They sit in separate pews. A large
wooden cross looms above them.
HERLIHY
Why do people kill themselves,
Father?

LAVELLE
Why do people kill themselves.
That’s jumping in at the deep
end. Lots of reasons, I suppose.
Why do you think yourself?
HERLIHY
I dunno. The drink. Depression.
Lack of sex, maybe.
LAVELLE
You’re a presentable young man.
I wouldn’t have thought you’d have
too much trouble in that area.
HERLIHY
I don’t have the gift of the gab.
Never had it.
LAVELLE
And it’s making you feel suicidal?
HERLIHY
More bored than anything else.
It’s either committing suicide or
joining the Army.
LAVELLE
Those are pretty drastic choices,
either way.
HERLIHY
You can learn a trade if you join
the Army.
LAVELLE
You can learn a trade if you don’t
join the Army.
HERLIHY
You can experience more of life.
LAVELLE
You think you can become a more
authentic person by fighting in a
war? By killing people?
HERLIHY
You’re against me joining the Army,
is what I’m sensing.
LAVELLE
Let’s put it this way, I’ve always
felt there was something inherently
psychopathic about someone who joins
the Army in peacetime. As far as
I’m concerned, people join the Army
because they want to find out what

LAVELLE (CONT'D)
it’s like to kill someone. I don’t
think that is an inclination that
should be encouraged in modern
society, do you?

HERLIHY shrugs, non-committal.
LAVELLE
Jesus Christ didn’t think so either.
And the commandment “Thou Shalt Not
Kill” does not have an asterisk beside
it, referring you to the bottom of
the page, where there’s a list of
instances where it is okay to kill
people.
HERLIHY
What about self-defence?
LAVELLE
(after a pause)
Well that’s a tricky one, alright.
But we’re hardly being invaded, now,
are we?
HERLIHY
The War on Terror has no borders.
LAVELLE
I don’t think Sligo is too high on
al-Qaida’s agenda, Milo, do you?
HERLIHY
Who knows what goes on in the Muslim
mind?
(pause)
I have had murderous feelings, though,
I have to admit. Not getting laid.
It’s starting to make me feel really
angry towards women. And so I thought,
well, if I joined the Army, those
inclinations as you call them would
be seen as a plus. On your application,
like. I mean, they don’t come right
out and say that’s what they’re
looking for, in the advertisements,
it’s all about seeing the world and
all that shite, but I would assume
that wanting to murder someone would
be like having a degree in engineering
or something, y’know? It would outweigh
my lack of qualifications.

women with loose morals are
increased proportionately.

HERLIHY
Sligo Town, you mean?
LAVELLE
No. I was thinking more Dublin,
London, New York-HERLIHY
New York? I’d only end up getting
the Aids. Knowing my luck.
PULL BACK to reveal HERLIHY is astride a motorbike.
HERLIHY
Thanks for taking the time to talk

wouldn’t have a lot of options,
apparently not.

LAVELLE
Well I’m sorry to hear that.
FITZGERALD shrugs, takes a swallow of his drink.
LAVELLE
You mentioned a financial proposition?
FITZGERALD
I want to make amends. Do penance
for past sins. Although I suppose
all sins are past, aren’t they, or
they wouldn’t be sins, they’d just
be evil thoughts floating around
in your mind. Why do you wear the
auld soutane, by the way? Trying
to make a statement or something?
LAVELLE looks blankly at him. Sips his water.
FITZGERALD smirks. Shoots back a cuff to reveal a gold Tag
Heuer watch at his wrist.

LAVELLE looks blankly at him.
FITZGERALD
I’ll tell you what you see. You see
a handsome, sophisticated, eminent
man in the prime of his life.
A Colossus, let’s say. A Colossus
who once bestrode the world of
high finance and became profoundly
influential in certain spheres,
not to say inordinately wealthy,
not to say sickeningly wealthy,
let’s face it.

pours another)
Sure I can’t tempt you?
LAVELLE
I’ll stick to the water.

half the financiers in Ireland,
and half the bank managers along
with them, and troop into government
then and charge those cunts as well,
and we all know full well that’s not
going to happen. No, there’ll be no
punishment forthcoming for a man
such as myself. There never is.
Still, I do feel a modicum of guilt

Not sure what it’s supposed to mean,
though.
LAVELLE
Why does it have to mean anything?
FITZGERALD
Everything has to mean something,
otherwise what’s the point? Of course,
I don’t have to know what it means.
I own it. That’s enough.

LAVELLE
Yes, I am. But I try not to be.
FITZGERALD
You think I have no feelings?
You think I don’t care about-LAVELLE
I think you don’t want to do penance
at all. I think you asked me here to
make fun of me. But when you do want
to do penance, sincerely, you can
give me a call, at any time, and
I’ll try my best to help you.

He walks towards the front door.
FITZGERALD
You know, I could piss on this.
(gesturing at the painting)
I said I loved it, but I don’t.
It doesn’t mean anything to me.
I could take it down right now
and piss on it. Do you want me
to do that?
LAVELLE
Why would I want you to do that?
FITZGERALD
I don’t know. So I could have
some kind of spiritual revelation?
Some fucking epiphany?
LAVELLE
Well I don’t know, now. People like
you have pissed on everything else,
I suppose, so why not that, too?
FITZGERALD nods. Grins. Takes down the painting and drops

Ages. Eons.

LAVELLE
Did I ever tell you the story of
Fionn Mac Cumhaill and another
big strong lad named Cicsatóin?
They were up the top-FIONA
They were up the top of the Ox
Mountains. Cicsatóin challenged
Fionn to throw a boulder into the
sea at Easkey, claiming he couldn’t
do it. Fionn accepted the challenge.
Cicsatóin’s boulder landed on the
Easkey shore, where it created such
waves that the sea hasn't been the
same since, which is why the Easkey
coastline is internationally renowned
for surfing. Fionn’s boulder fell
short and landed here. Fionn drew
his sword and split the rock in two.
It’s said that should anyone be
foolhardy enough to pass through
the rock three times, the two halves
will come together and they will be
squashed into tiny little lumps.
Unceremoniously.
LAVELLE
Not a lot of poetry in that recital.
Not a lot of romance.
FIONA
I’m sick to death of romance.

INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT
FRANK HARTE, who happens to be a doctor, watching LAVELLE
fussing with the contents of a black Gladstone bag.
HARTE
You have your totems, I see.
LAVELLE
Who is it?
HARTE
French couple. Head on. She was
totally unscathed. He got fucked.
LAVELLE
Wrong side of the road?
HARTE
Car full of young ones hit them.
Drunk, of course.
LAVELLE places a stole about his neck.
LAVELLE
How many?
HARTE
Five including the Frenchman.
LAVELLE
Dear God.
HARTE
Marine biologist he was.
That’s where I’d like to be.
Under the sea.
LAVELLE
Where are the young ones?

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
LAURENT ROBERT lies dying, his face and body bandaged,
tubes sticking out of him. TERESA, his wife, holding his
hand, her mascara wet around her eyes.
LAVELLE looks at them both.
DISSOLVE through CLOSE-UPS of LAVELLE, TERESA, LAURENT.
LAVELLE
Through this holy anointing may
the Lord in his love and mercy
help you with the grace of the
Holy Spirit.
DISSOLVE through CLOSE-UPS of LAVELLE’s fingers, the oil,
and LAURENT’s forehead, as the anointing of the forehead
takes place.
TERESA
Amen.
DISSOLVE through CLOSE-UPS of LAVELLE’s fingers, the oil,
and LAURENT’s hands, as the anointing of the hands takes

LAVELLE
May the Lord who frees you from
sin save you and raise you up.
TERESA
Amen.

INT. CHAPEL - NIGHT
CLOSE on the face of Christ. A stained-glass window. The
faces of LAVELLE and TERESA.
TERESA
Have you performed the Last Rites
many times?
LAVELLE
Yes. Usually with older people, of
course. You have time to prepare for
it. Everybody knows what’s coming.

TERESA
It is easier?
LAVELLE
It’s never easy. More understandable,
let’s say. Less unfair.
TERESA
Unfair.
LAVELLE
Situations like this one, people
are shocked. The randomness of it.
They curse God. Curse their fellow
man. They lose their faith, in some
cases.
TERESA
They lose their faith? It must not
have been much of a faith to begin
with, if it is so easy for them to
lose it.
LAVELLE
Yes. But what is faith, at the end
of the day? For most people it’s
the fear of death, nothing more than
that. And if that’s all it is, then
it’s very easy to lose.
TERESA
(after a pause)
When we are children we are told to
say our prayers. Our parents tell us,
our teachers. Then we grow up and we
think people who say their prayers
are stupid. They’re ridiculous.
Unless we want money, of course, or
a good job, or we have a child who
is sick, or a lover who is dying.
Then we are allowed to pray again.
Then it is okay.
LAVELLE
Yes. But the prayer must be answered.
TERESA
Yes, the prayer must be answered.
And if the prayer is not answered
then there is no God and it is all
a lie. If God does not pay attention
to us, because we are so important,
then God does not exist.
LAVELLE
Yes. We must be paid attention to.
(pause)
He was a good man, your husband?
(CONTINUED)

45.
54

CONTINUED:

54
TERESA
Yes, he was a good man. We had a
very good life together. We loved
each other very much. And now he
has gone. That is not unfair, that
is just what happened. But many
people do not live good lives, and
they do not feel love. That is what
is unfair. I feel sorry for them.
LAVELLE
(after a pause)
Will you say a prayer with me,
Teresa?
TERESA
Yes.
LAVELLE
Hail Mary, full of grace-TERESA/LAVELLE
--the Lord is with thee. Blessed
art thou amongst women, and blessed
is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.
Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for
us sinners, now and at the hour of
our death. Amen.

EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT
HARTE is smoking a cigarette. LAVELLE steps outside.
HARTE
Finished with all your gobbledegook?
LAVELLE does not acknowledge the insult.
HARTE
How’s she holding up?
LAVELLE
She’s a strong woman.
HARTE
Good-looking, too. I could be in
there. I have a thing for widows,
did I ever tell you?
LAVELLE
I think you might have done.
Your material is getting a little
stale after all.
HARTE
Ah sure, the atheistic doctor,
it’s a clichéd part to play.
There’s not that many good lines.

LAVELLE
Playing me. Who’s “me”?
HARTE
The good priest.

They look at each other. Then HARTE looks up at the moon.
HARTE
I heard a story once about one of
the astronauts who slept on the moon.
He had a dream where he was driving
one of those moon buggies across the
surface of the moon, and he rode and
he rode until he came upon another
buggy that was exactly like his.
He looked into the face of the man
who was driving the buggy and he saw
that it was himself. And his double
said to him, “I’ve been waiting for
you for thousands of years.”
And that was the end of the dream.
LAVELLE studies him. HARTE turns aside, opening the door -HARTE
Excuse me, won’t you. I have to go
kill somebody.

TITLE -- “Wednesday”.
MICHEÁL is in his vestments, swinging a thurible to and

frame, preparing for Mass.
MICHEÁL
They’re mad auld things thurifers,
aren’t they?
LAVELLE
That’s a thurible. You’re a thurifer.
MICHEÁL
I’m a thurifer?
(pause)
Thurifer. Funny word.

I like the smell of this stuff.
It gets me high.

MICHEÁL
I know plenty.
LAVELLE
Micheál, why did you become an
altar boy? I ask this because it
can safely be said, without fear
of contradiction, that you have
no vocation whatsoever.
MICHEÁL
My Ma told me they give you money
at weddings and christenings.
LAVELLE
I see. It was purely a moneymaking
scheme on your part.
MICHEÁL
Yeah. To pay for my oils.
LAVELLE
To pay for your oils.
MICHEÁL
Yeah. And I haven’t had a sovereign
off anybody. People round here are
pure mean.

EXT. INISHMURRAY ISLAND - DAY
HIGH-ANGLE SHOT -- LAVELLE and RYAN walking through the
remains of an early Irish monastic settlement. They enter
the cemetery. RYAN leaning heavily on his shillelagh.
LAVELLE
Is this where you want to be buried?
RYAN
Why in the hell would I want to be
buried in this godforsaken place?
LAVELLE
(with a laugh)
Where then? Pere Lachaise? Next to
dear old Oscar?
RYAN
No. Next to Apollinaire and Max Ophüls.

Still in good working order, though.
Or so I’ve been told by a man who
would know.
RYAN
Hand it over, then.
LAVELLE
I don’t have it on me.
RYAN
I knew it. Worried I might follow
through with it, huh?
LAVELLE
You might take a potshot at me,
for all I know.
RYAN
Why would I do that? What have
you ever done to me except talk
garbage?
LAVELLE
Sure that doesn’t mean anything.
Bloody idiots can’t even be bothered
coming up with a reason for murder
these days. They wake up in a foul
mood and it’s bang bang bang.
RYAN
Oh I don’t know about that.
Some people have very good reasons.

EXT/INT. CONFESSIONAL - DAY
CLOSE on FIONA and LAVELLE. The shadow of the grille
playing across their faces. DISSOLVE THROUGH -FIONA
There was a Japanese writer
committed suicide. He wrote out
a list beforehand of all the
famous suicides throughout history.
He included Christ.
LAVELLE
Sounds like a smartarse.
FIONA
In the Middle Ages they would’ve
said I was possessed by demons.
LAVELLE
Maybe you were. Maybe they were
nearer the mark back then.

FIONA
You think what happened was unimportant. Insignificant in the
great scheme of things. To provoke
such a reaction. But what may mean
nothing to you may be very important
to me.
LAVELLE
I’d never say it was unimportant.
I’d just say that the choices you
make when you’re thirty are not
the same choices you’d make when
you’re sixty.
FIONA
That’s irrelevant. Every moment of
living has its own logic.
LAVELLE
Maybe so. Maybe you’re right, there.
I’d have to have a think about that.
(pause)
It’s a tired old argument, I suppose,
but what about those you leave behind.
FIONA
I belong to myself, not to anybody
else.
LAVELLE
True. False.

FIONA smiles. LAVELLE waits, attentive.
FIONA
Funny, in the old days it was the
priests who’d tell you you were sick.
Now it’s the psychiatrists.
(pause)
You know Freud had cancer of the gums
at the end of his life. The smell
from his mouth was so bad even his
own dog wouldn’t go near him.
He asked his doctor, an old friend
of his, to give him an overdose of
morphine. Which he did.
LAVELLE
Not a big fan of Freud. Never have
been.

A GUARD escorts LAVELLE around the prison.

LAVELLE
Freddie Joyce.
The GUARD pauses and looks at LAVELLE.
LAVELLE
Freddie Joyce? He’s-GUARD
I know who he is. What in the

There’s no capital punishment in
Ireland, Freddie, as you well know.
Why do you want them to hang you?
JOYCE
‘Cause that’s the way Lesley Ryan
died.
LAVELLE
You’re saying you feel remorse.
JOYCE
I’m not a monster. Do I look like
a monster?
LAVELLE
What do monsters look like?
JOYCE
“To thine own self be true,” they
say. Well I was, and look where
it’s got me.
LAVELLE
They’ve never really thought that
one through, you’re right.
JOYCE
It’s a terrible world. When you
think about it.
LAVELLE
Yes it is. And a beautiful one.
JOYCE
It wasn’t for me.
LAVELLE
You’re not the whole world.
JOYCE
That’s a matter of opinion.

He watches a cockroach scuttling around in a corner of the
ceiling.
JOYCE
I’m reading Paradise Lost at

I had the cops in here the other
day. The third degree. Wanting
to go over all the gory details.
LAVELLE
Which I’m sure you were only too
happy to provide.
JOYCE
They’re obsessed with cannibalism.
“What did it taste like?” Told ‘em
it tasted like pheasant. Bit gamey.
LAVELLE
Good for you. Make a joke about it.
JOYCE looks blankly at him.
LAVELLE
Why were they-JOYCE
Same as always. They want to know
where the last one is. The one I
connected up. The one they never
found.
LAVELLE
Why can’t you tell them, Freddie?
Give the family some kind of peace.
JOYCE
I wanted to, Father, but for the
life of me I can’t remember. I know
it was out in the woods somewhere-LAVELLE
Where did I leave my keys.
JOYCE
No. I wasn’t in my right mind.
The LSD. It was like a fairytale-LAVELLE
Yeah you said all that at the trial.
It’s getting kind of tiresome now.
JOYCE
She was a lovely girl...Y’know she
told me she’d been abused before.
So I said, “Well once more won’t
make any difference, then.”

Fingers the beads absently.

LAVELLE
No you don’t. No. You don’t.
JOYCE smirks. Watches LAVELLE fingering the beads.
JOYCE
“The woods are lovely, dark and
deep, but I have promises to keep.”
(with a laugh)
It’s like that joke. You know that
joke? There’s a fella with this young
lad driving into the woods, right.
It’s getting darker and darker the
deeper into the woods they go, and
the young lad says, “I’m getting
scared, Mister.” And the fella says-LAVELLE
Yeah I do know that joke. I’ve heard
it before.
JOYCE
You’re always one step ahead, aren’t
you, Father? It’s like when we were
back in school-LAVELLE
(angrily)
Why am I here? For the love of God.
JOYCE
(taken aback)
I just wanted somebody to talk to.
LAVELLE
I don’t think you feel any guilt
whatsoever about anything you’ve done.
JOYCE
(suddenly sobbing)
I do, Father, I do.
(sniffling; wiping his nose
on his shoulder)
I believe what the Bible teaches.
I believe if I repent my sins I’ll
be forgiven and I’ll be able to go
up to Heaven and see those girls
and tell them how sorry I am, and
I’ll hug them and I’ll kiss them

LYNCH is keeping up a ping-pong ball with a table tennis

LYNCH
You know they’re foreclosing on me.
LAVELLE
Who?
LYNCH
Who? The banks. Who else.
LAVELLE
I’m sorry to hear that.
LYNCH
How come I never hear your mob
preaching about that?
LAVELLE
About what?
LYNCH
All these bankers who’ve brought
the country to its knees. Still
throwing people out of their
homes, though, when they can’t
make their payments. Never hear
your mob talking about that.
Those are sins, too, aren’t they?
LAVELLE
Yes they are.
LYNCH
Ah sure, I suppose when you have a
history of screwing the Jews out
of their money and collaborating
with the Nazis then, it’s like the
pot calling the kettle black, hah?

FIONA waves to LAVELLE as he enters. Then returns to her

FATHER LEARY is talking to a handsome blond SURFER DUDE.

Or shouldn’t be, anyways.
LEARY
I can’t see the point in it myself.
Dead loss.

STANTON
Who are you talking about?
Not Freddie Joyce?
LAVELLE
I visited him in prison today.
STANTON
Why?
LAVELLE
Prisoners deserve spiritual guidance
as much as anyone else. Maybe more
so.
STANTON
Is that right? So they can find God
and then say God has absolved them
of all their sins and what they did
didn’t really matter anyways ‘cause
now they’re saved?
LAVELLE
Something like that, yeah.
LEARY

Calm down. You don’t know what
you’re talking about.

Ah, I’ve sinned more than that.
LAVELLE
Make an ascent of Croagh Patrick,

VERONICA
On my knees, is it? What made you

She looks blankly at him. He finishes his Diet Coke. She

LEARY
Burning the place down, though?

Nobody with a grudge against you,

LAVELLE has been trailing in his wake.
LAVELLE
No doubt.
MONTGOMERY inhales the scent of the roses.
MONTGOMERY
Who is it?
LAVELLE
I don’t know who it is.
MONTGOMERY turns and looks at him.
MONTGOMERY
You said you did.

LAVELLE
I have no evidence it’s the same man.
It’s the same
nerve to burn
if you have a
grievance. If

MONTGOMERY
man. Takes a lot of
down a church. Helps
burning sense of

He walks on. LAVELLE following.
MONTGOMERY
We have to ask ourselves, What does
this man want? Well, he wants to
be loved, of course. We all want
to be loved. Failing that, he wants
to be admired. Failing that, he
wants to be feared. And failing that,
he wants to be hated and despised.
We should beware the man who wants
to be hated and despised. Don’t you
think?
LAVELLE
(after a pause)
I think you read that in a book.
MONTGOMERY smiles. They move on.
LAVELLE
I think he wants to stir up some
sort of feeling in others, that’s
true. He doesn’t want to be ignored
anymore. He wants to make contact.
MONTGOMERY
Well he made contact alright.
Who is it?

EXT. BEACH - DAY
VERONICA emerges from the water to find LAVELLE waiting
for her.
VERONICA
Is this about the coke?
I can take it or leave it.

*
*
*
*

LAVELLE
Really?
VERONICA
Yeah. Most people can. The only
ones who can’t, had problems to
begin with.

*

LAVELLE
We shouldn’t write them off,
though, the ones who had problems
to begin with.

*
*

VERONICA dries her hair with a towel. Studies him.

*

LAVELLE
What do you want to do with your
life, Veronica?

*
*
*

VERONICA
Nothing. “Consider the lilies of
the field, how they grow. They
toil not, neither do they spin.”

LAVELLE
That’s a very nice quotation.

VERONICA
Ah sure everybody knows that one.

LAVELLE
It’s hackneyed, yeah. Like “Turn
the other cheek,” and “Judge not,
lest ye be judged.”
They look at each other.
VERONICA
I’d like to be an actress, maybe.
I’ve got an absent father and a
domineering mother.

*
*
*
*

LAVELLE
Well it’s a start. When did your
father leave?
VERONICA
He didn’t leave, he was killed.

*
*

LAVELLE
He was murdered?
VERONICA
Hunting accident.
(pause)
Completely random.
(pause)
So there’s no use persevering,
Father. I’m a lost cause.

LAVELLE
No one’s a lost cause, Veronica.

VERONICA glances at him, then strides away.

INT. RECTORY (STUDY) - DAY

FITZGERALD with a big smile on his face.
FITZGERALD
Dreadful business, I must say.
Some little blackguard running
riot, I wouldn’t wonder.
He is standing between two desks, jingling the change in
his pockets. LAVELLE at one desk. LEARY at the other.
LEARY
Sure what can you do, in this day
and age.

*
*

FITZGERALD
True dat.
(to LAVELLE)
Sorry about the other day, Father.
That was the drink talking.
LAVELLE
What can we do for you?
FITZGERALD
Well it follows on from what I was
saying. And it seems more necessary
now than ever.
(producing a cheque-book)
I’d like to make a donation.
LEARY
(getting up)
Oh that’s grand!

*

LAVELLE
To salve your conscience?
FITZGERALD
Surely that’s in the nature of all
philanthropy? The expiation of guilt?
LEARY
I’m sure you have nothing major to
feel guilty about, Mr Fitzgerald.

*

(CONTINUED)

66.
71

CONTINUED:

71
FITZGERALD
Oh you’d be surprised, Father.
And call me Michael.
LEARY
Michael it is. Any charity is always
gratefully received.

*

FITZGERALD
I know. I believe that’s Church
doctrine. And the Church needs all
the help it can get these days, hah?
LEARY
Why would you say that?

*

FITZGERALD
Well, y’know, what with all the
compensation that’s been paid out
over the years.
LEARY’s superficial smile freezes on his face.

*

FITZGERALD
I read where it’s up to two billion
now. And that’s just the Yanks.
And sure we all know they weren’t
the worst, now, don’t we?
LAVELLE looks blankly at him. Then blankly at LEARY to
gauge his reaction.
LEARY
I don’t know about that, now. And
anyways, most of those cases were
forty or fifty years ago. Raking up
old ground, it’s always seemed to
me. It’s time to forgive and forget.

*
*

FITZGERALD
Oh I agree with you, I agree with
you. It’s time to move on. What’s
past is past. Et cetera, et cetera.
LEARY
Ah...Would you like a cup of tea,
Michael, or something--

*

FITZGERALD
No, no, can’t stop.
He sits in LEARY’s chair. Waves the cheque-book --

*

FITZGERALD
What are we talking? Ten? Twenty?
LEARY
Twenty thousand?

*

(CONTINUED)

67.
71

CONTINUED:

71
FITZGERALD
Twenty thousand euros, yeah.

LEARY perches himself on the desk. Excited.

*

LEARY
Why that’d be grand. That’d help
with getting the initial building
work off the ground.

*

FITZGERALD
Twenty it is, then.
(producing a beautiful
Pierrot White fountain pen)
This is a David Oscarson pen.
Really expensive.
LEARY

*

It’s lovely.
LAVELLE
Why not make it fifty?
FITZGERALD and LEARY look at him. FITZGERALD smiles.

*

LEARY
Ah now, Father--

*

LAVELLE
If money’s no object, make it fifty.
FITZGERALD
Why not make it a hundred?
LEARY’s jaw drops open. He looks at LAVELLE.

*

FITZGERALD
Means nothing to me.
LAVELLE
I know it doesn’t.
FITZGERALD
A hundred thousand euros, Father.
For your pet project. What do you
say to that?
LAVELLE
I say, Thank you, Mister Fitzgerald.
FITZGERALD grins.

LAVELLE and FIONA eating.
LAVELLE
It’s my fault.

FIONA
How is it your fault what some
crazy person-LAVELLE
I should have done something.
Said something.
FIONA
(after a pause)
What was Stanton was getting at?
LAVELLE
If I could tell you I would.
You know that.
FIONA
I thought I was the one supposed
to be in trouble, not you.
They look at each other.
VERONICA (O.S.)
How’s the fish?
They look up to see VERONICA BRENNAN, coked up, standing
over them. Glamorously dressed, a gin-and-tonic in her
hand.
LAVELLE
Too many little bones.
VERONICA
Isn’t that always the way.
She grabs a chair and sits at their table. FIONA looks at
her, then at LAVELLE.
VERONICA
I’m not stopping. Meeting the fella.
LAVELLE
You’re informing me of your adultery
in advance?

confessional when it’s all done-anddusted and there’s nothing you can
do about it?
FIONA
What are you expecting him to do
about it now?
VERONICA
Stop me from committing a mortal sin.
LAVELLE
You have to stop yourself. I can’t
stop you.
VERONICA
Then what good are you at all?

FIONA shoots another look at LAVELLE.
VERONICA
You’re right, though. I mean, who
are you to lecture anyone when it
comes to sex?
FIONA
He has as much right as anyone else-VERONICA
I don’t think virgins have any call
to be dictating--

*
*

LAVELLE
What makes you think I’m a virgin?
Fiona’s my daughter.
VERONICA
Oh I thought she was just some young
one you were fiddling around with.
LAVELLE almost flinches.
FIONA
Oh you bitch.
LAVELLE looks at VERONICA with utter disgust. She notices
this, and smiles.
VERONICA
You want to hit me now, don’t ya?
Go on. Hit me.
LAVELLE looks blankly at her. She grins.
Suddenly, FIONA hits her a massive slap to the face --(CONTINUED)

OTHER DINERS glance around. One of whom is LEO MACARTHUR.
He laughs as he picks at his teeth with a toothpick -VERONICA rubs her reddened cheek. Tears in her eyes. But
still defiant. She glares at FIONA.
VERONICA
Nice shot. But I’ve taken better.
LAVELLE
What is this, exactly?
The Theatre of the Absurd?
VERONICA
Oh you’re very fond of your highfalutin’ phrases, aren’t you, Father.
I do think you do look down on us
country people.
She knocks back her drink. Glancing out the window, she
sees SIMON ASAMOAH approaching.
VERONICA
There’s my ride, as it were.
Let’s do this again some time.
She exits. Leaving startled DINERS in her wake.
FIONA
Do you have to put up with that
kind of shit on a regular basis?
Through the window we can see VERONICA as she reappears
and throws her arms around ASAMOAH. ASAMOAH looks blankly
at LAVELLE and FIONA.
LAVELLE
There’s a lot of it going around,
let’s put it that way.

LAVELLE and FIONA walking along.

LAVELLE
Your mother dying killed a little
something in both of us, I know that.
FIONA
It was a long goodbye if ever there
was one. I sometimes wish she hadn’t
hung on as long as she did.
LAVELLE
She was stubborn, alright. But brave,
too. I wonder if I’ll be that brave,
when it comes down to it.
FIONA
It wasn’t just her dying. You were
missing in action a long time.
Before and after. When I needed you
the most.
LAVELLE
Was it really that bad?
FIONA
I don’t know, maybe I’m exaggerating.
You were a highly-functioning
alcoholic, I’ll give you that.
LAVELLE
I’ve always thought the “highlyfunctioning” part should cancel out
the “alcoholic” part. Like a double
negative.

FIONA smiles. They come upon MICHEÁL sitting in an old
wooden boat, staring out to sea, a Davy Crockett hat on.
LAVELLE
What are you up to, there, Micheál,
if you don’t mind me asking?
MICHEÁL
Thinking.
LAVELLE
Thinking. Thinking about what?
MICHEÁL
Things.
LAVELLE
Thinking about things. How profound.
FIONA
What’s that you’re wearing?
MICHEÁL
A hat.

FIONA laughs.

EXT. EASKEY SHORELINE - EVENING
LAVELLE and FIONA manoeuvre between the rock-pools.
LAVELLE
I was never neglectful, I don’t think.
I never hit you or-FIONA
There are other forms of violence.
LAVELLE
I know there are. Attempting suicide,
for one.
FIONA
Jesus. I walked into that one.
LAVELLE
Not only violence against yourself,
either.
FIONA
It wasn’t intended that way. I wasn’t
trying to hurt you.
LAVELLE
How could it not hurt me? I love you.
FIONA
I love you, too. Don’t doubt that.
They look at each other. Put their arms around each other
and walk on.
FIONA
And just when I thought I had you
back and you were all ship-shape
and raring to go, go you did.
I thought it’d be another woman.

*

LAVELLE
I have a vocation. I wasn’t trying
to escape or-FIONA
I know that. I know you’re sincere.
But the fact remains, first she went
away and then you went away. I lost
two parents for the price of one.

FIONA

They stop as they reach the edge of the rock-face, looking
out over the sea.
LAVELLE
I’m still here. I’ll always be here.
FIONA
Will you?
(with a sad smile)
You promise?
LAVELLE
(pointing to her heart)
I’ll always be here.

And you’ll always be here.

INT. COTTAGE (BEDROOM) - NIGHT
RYAN is lying fully-clothed on his bed, a multicoloured
quilt beneath him. The shillelagh by his side.
LAVELLE pours him a bourbon.
RYAN
You know how you can tell when you’re
really getting old?
LAVELLE
How?
RYAN
Nobody says the word “death” around
you anymore.

LAVELLE looks at him. Holds out the glass. RYAN pops two
large pills from a vial into his mouth. Takes the glass -RYAN
Here’s mud in your eye!
Tosses back the bourbon in one go. Motions for another.

Nobody’s stopping you.
RYAN raises the shillelagh as if it were a conductor’s
baton and sings -RYAN
“You will eat, by and by, in that
glorious land above the sky--”
LAVELLE smiles. Shakes his head.
RYAN
“--Work and pray, live on hay, you’ll
get pie in the sky when you die!”
LAVELLE
God, you’re an awful man altogether.
RYAN cackles. LAVELLE hands him the bourbon.

water.”

EXT. FIELDS - NIGHT
LAVELLE walks through the fields behind the rectory,
lighting his way with an old oil lamp.
LAVELLE
Bruno! Bruno!
He goes on through the fields. Pauses, having spotted
something up ahead. Walks on -LAVELLE’s POV -- the dog lying dead.
LAVELLE looks down at the dog. Its throat has been cut. A
puddle of blood around its body. He crouches beside the
body. Touches its coat.
LAVELLE
Ah what has he done to you?
(crying softly)
What has he done to you, Bruno?
He strokes the glossy coat, still crying.

EXT. FIELD - NIGHT
LAVELLE finishes digging a hole. Puts the shovel to one
side, where Bruno lies enveloped in a bright red blanket.
He hefts the bundle and places it gently in the hole.
Shovels earth onto the bundle until it is completely
covered. Pats it down.
He puts his hands together atop the shovel and says a
prayer.

She nods.
LAVELLE
Where are you from, Wicklow?

GIRL
Yeah.
LAVELLE
Well never mind. We won’t hold it

Janine! Get in the car, now.
The GIRL quickly crosses to the car.
MAN

Where the hell d’ya get to, honey?
I’ve been looking all over for ya.
The GIRL gets in. The MAN turns to LAVELLE, angry again -MAN
What were you saying to her?

ASAMOAH and BRENNAN are playing chess in a corner of the
bar. BRENNAN looks round.
LYNCH
You sure about that?
LAVELLE
Whiskey, I said.
LYNCH gets the drink. Sky News playing a report from
Afghanistan.
LYNCH
I wonder what’s the latest in the
sand-nigger war?
ASAMOAH looks up. Smirks.
HARTE
Looks like more dead to me.
But then again, who’s counting?
LYNCH passes LAVELLE the whiskey. LAVELLE knocks it back.
LAVELLE
Have one yourself. Might shut you up.
LYNCH
Ah sure that’s what they call them,
sand-niggers. The Marines, I mean.
I read it in a book about that young
one they raped and murdered, y’know?
They killed her entire family, then
they turned on her.
LAVELLE
That’s your bedside reading, is it?
LYNCH
I like to keep up with American
foreign policy. Another?

ASAMOAH
Who burned down your church, Father?
LAVELLE
It’s not my church. It’s our church.
BRENNAN
I’d say it was the Romanians.
They’re heathens, I think.
LYNCH
The Romanians? What Romanians do
we have around here?
BRENNAN
Ah they’re always hanging around,
the Romanians. Getting up to no good.
ASAMOAH
I think it must be someone who does
not like you, Father. I think it must
be one of the good people in this town.
HARTE
You should join the Guards, Simon,
with your powers of deduction.
BRENNAN
Checkmate.
ASAMOAH looks down at the pieces. Then back up at BRENNAN.
BRENNAN picks up his whiskey, and goes to the bar.
BRENNAN
These measures, hey, Father.
It’s like a buttercup in the mouth
of a cow. Guinness, there, Brendan.
He knocks back his whiskey. Glances slyly at LAVELLE.
BRENNAN
So you think there’s a God, then,
Father, yeah?

CLOSE on a rack of pool balls being split.

LEO MACARTHUR, practising on his own, chalks his cue as he

LEO
Hey Fada! Whaddaya hear, whaddaya
say!
LAVELLE
You’re back, so?
LEO
I got a lotta clients in this town,
Fada. From the hoi polloi to the
masses of society. I gotta keep my
ass lubricated at all times.
LAVELLE
The hoi polloi are the masses of
society. You’re using the phrase
incorrectly.
LEO pauses in the act of making a shot. Smirks.
LEO
That may be so, Fada. I didn’t get no
education, see. I was getting fucked
in the ass and fucked in the face all
the live-long day. There wasn’t no
time for any o’ dat dere book-learnin’.

INT. LYNCH’S BAR - NIGHT
LAVELLE at a table, brooding over a Guinness with a
whiskey chaser. HARTE mooches over.
HARTE
Y’know when I first started working
in Dublin, there was this threeyear-old boy whose parents had taken
him into the hospital for a routine
operation, but the anesthesiologist
made a mistake, and the little boy
ended up being deaf, dumb, blind
and paralysed. For good.
(pause)
Think of it. Think of when that boy
first regained consciousness. In the
dark. You’d be frightened, wouldn’t
you. But you’d be frightened in that
way where you know that the fear is
going to end. It has to. It must.
Your parents can’t be too far away.
They’ll come to your rescue. They’ll
turn on the light and they’ll talk
to you.
(pause)
But think of it. Nobody comes to
rescue you. No light is turned on.
You are in the dark. You try to speak
but you can’t. You try to move but
you can’t. You try to cry out but
you are unable to hear your own
screams. You are entombed within
your own body, howling with terror.
(pause)
Your parents stand around you.
They have no way to communicate with
you. They have no way to explain what
has happened to you. Will you ever
understand what has happened to you?

drinking, encompassing pints and shorts.
Only ASAMOAH left in the bar with LYNCH. They pass a
spliff back and forth, glancing at LAVELLE.
LYNCH
Time to go. Come on.
LAVELLE looks round at ASAMOAH.
LAVELLE
He’s still drinking. Same again.
LYNCH
Time to go, I said.
LAVELLE
What’s that, an order?
ASAMOAH
You do not like taking orders, Father?
You do not mind giving them.

ASAMOAH
You need to be a little more humble,
Father.
LYNCH
He needs taking down a peg or two,
is what he needs.

LAVELLE looks at them both. He steps down from his stool,
puts his hand into the pocket of his soutane, and
withdraws the Webley revolver, aiming it at them -LAVELLE
Take me down, then.
ASAMOAH steps back, but LYNCH doesn’t flinch. He looks
coolly at LAVELLE -LYNCH
Go on. I fucking dare ya.
LAVELLE looks blankly at him. Adjusts his aim and fires -Into the ranks of spirits and the mirror behind the bar,

LEARY
Jesus Christ! What happened to you?

*
*

LAVELLE
Brendan Lynch.
LEARY
Brendan Lynch? Sure he’s a Buddhist.

*

LAVELLE
So what if he’s a fucking Buddhist?
You think Buddhists don’t beat people
up? You think Buddhists don’t fuck
their kids just like everybody else?
LEARY
You’re obviously very upset--

*

LAVELLE
Tibetans spit on blind people in the
street. They’re killing albinos in
Africa. You are so fucking naive.
LEARY
Please don’t curse at me, Father.
And I think it’d be best if we
continue this conversation in the
morning when you’re sober--

*

LAVELLE
Why are you a fucking priest at all?
You should be a fucking accountant
in a fucking insurance firm!
He slams shut the door.

INT. LAVELLE’S ROOM - MORNING
TITLE -- “Saturday”.

LAVELLE lying prone on his bed, bruises all over his body,
still wearing his trousers and socks. His soutane in a
black pile on the floor.
He awakens. Gives a wretched groan.

EXT. RECTORY - MORNING
LEARY hands a suitcase to a CABBIE --

*

LAVELLE (O.S.)
You’re leaving.
LEARY turns. LAVELLE is standing there, squinting in the
sunlight. Wearing a horrible woollen V-neck sweater.
Drinking from a pint-glass of water.

CONTINUED:

LEARY
I think it’s for the best.

*

LAVELLE
Because of last night?
LEARY
Because of a lot of things. Not just
last night, or what’s happened here.
I’ve been having doubts...about my
sexuality, if you must know.

*

LAVELLE
You’re not gay, Father. You’re not
interesting enough to be gay.

*
*
*

LEARY is taken aback yet again.

*
*

*

LAVELLE
Listen, I’m sorry about what I said
last night.

*
*
*

LEARY
You said what you said with such
venom. I didn’t realise you hated
me that much.

*

LAVELLE
I don’t hate you at all.
LEARY
Then why...

*
*

LAVELLE
It’s just that you have no integrity.
And that’s the worst thing I can say
about anybody.
LEARY
Well that’s...That’s just...
He heads for the car.

*
*

LAVELLE
I hope you find what you’re looking
for. Good luck.
LEARY gets into the cab. It drives away.

He drives through the town. Past the fields. The castle.
Then -MILO HERLIHY zooms up alongside on his motorcycle. Looks

HERLIHY accelerates, speeding on ahead, disappearing out
of sight.

TERESA (O.S.)
Father.

LAVELLE turns to find TERESA ROBERT standing next to him.
She glances at his clothes, his cut lip.

*
*

LAVELLE
Oh hello.

*

TERESA
You are going to Dublin?
LAVELLE
Yes.
(pause)
Just getting away for a while,
y’know.

TERESA
I heard about your church.
A terrible thing.

LAVELLE
Yes.
TERESA
You must be very upset.
LAVELLE
Yes I am.

LAVELLE glances out the window -LAVELLE’s POV -- a coffin is being escorted to the plane
by TWO BAGGAGE HANDLERS.
LAVELLE turns back to TERESA. She is watching the coffin.
TERESA
I am bringing him home to his
family in Italy. Dublin and then
Rome.
LAVELLE
How have you been?
TERESA
People here have been very kind.
LAVELLE
I mean...
TERESA
Some times I think I cannot go on.
(turning to look at him)
But I will go on.

EXT. AIRPLANE - EVENING
PASSENGERS climb the steps of the airplane, LAVELLE and
TERESA among them. LAVELLE pauses at the top, waiting his

TWO BAGGAGE HANDLERS are leaning against it. They laugh.

He buttons up the soutane. Fixes his collar. Kneels in
front of the crucifix and says a prayer. Blesses himself.

99

99

EXT. DOG’S-HOLE - MORNING
CLOSE on the Webley Revolver.

LAVELLE weighs it in his hand. Then tosses it out into the
crashing waves.
A wide crack in the cliff-face, the sea rushing in and
smashing upon the rocks. The spume shooting up to where
LAVELLE is standing, his soutane fluttering in the wind,
an almost mythic figure looking out over the Atlantic.
FITZGERALD appears and approaches, unheard. Eventually
LAVELLE turns, flinching at FITZGERALD’s proximity.
FITZGERALD
Thinking of throwing yourself in?
They say it’s the easy way out.
LAVELLE
Nothing easy about it, I wouldn’t
have thought.
They look out at the ocean.
FITZGERALD
I’m in a bad way, Father.
LAVELLE looks at him.
FITZGERALD
I’m not putting you on. I’ve been
in a bad way for a long time.
LAVELLE
Have you spoken to a psychia-FITZGERALD
Ah they just load you up on pills.
Ask you about your feelings for
your mother. Same auld shite since
the ‘20s.
LAVELLE
How does this...this feeling down...
How does it manifest itself?

(CONTINUED)

88.
99

CONTINUED:

99
FITZGERALD
Not wanting to do anything. Finding
nothing worthwhile. A sense of...
disassociation. Detachment.
LAVELLE
You have a lot to be thankful for,
objectively.
FITZGERALD
I had a wife and kids and they meant
nothing to me. I have money and it
means nothing to me. I have life and
it means nothing to me.
LAVELLE
Where do you think this sense of
detachment comes from?
FITZGERALD
From nowhere.
(pause)
From nowhere.

LAVELLE studies FITZGERALD as FITZGERALD looks out to sea.
He is obviously sincere, and in a lot of pain.
LAVELLE
I have to meet someone now, but I’ll
call up to the house after. We’ll
talk. Get you back on track. Okay?
FITZGERALD
Thank you, Father. Thank you.
LAVELLE puts an arm around his shoulders. FITZGERALD leans
into him, resting his head in the crook of LAVELLE’s neck.

Y’know, you changed the subject,

LAVELLE on the payphone.
LAVELLE

Train station. Lynch’s bar. Lavelle’s room. Country road.
Easkey River. Split-rock. Confessional. Church ruins.
Rectory exterior. Restaurant. Beach. Shoreline.
FIONA (V.O.)
You know what the subject was.
I think you committed a sin of
omission there, if truth be told.
LAVELLE (V.O.)
Sure there are worse sins than sins
of omission.
FIONA (V.O.)
Well now you’d be the expert in that
department, Father.
LAVELLE (V.O.)
You’ll have to defer to me, so.
FIONA (V.O.)
I suppose I will.
LAVELLE (V.O.)
I think there’s too much talk about
sins, to be honest, and not enough
talk about virtues.
FIONA (V.O.)
You might be right. What would be your
number one?
LAVELLE (V.O.)
I think forgiveness has been highly
underrated.
FIONA (V.O.)
(after a pause)
I forgive you. Do you forgive me?
LAVELLE (V.O.)
Always.

EXT. EASKEY - MORNING
SLOW-MOTION TRACKING SHOT following LAVELLE as he walks

LAVELLE
Little early for Mass.

CONTINUED:
RYAN
Doctor Harte was out fishing at the
crack of dawn. He begrudgingly gave
me a ride. He’s a wonderful doctor,
but a completely appalling human
being. Where are you headed?
LAVELLE
Just down to the beach there.
RYAN
Want some company?
LAVELLE
Not really, no. Maybe later.
RYAN
Fair enough. I won’t keep you.
He starts to move off, leaning on his shillelagh.
LAVELLE
Did you finish your book?
RYAN
I did. Not sure how good it is...
LAVELLE
I’m sure it’ll be grand.
You’re a fine writer.
RYAN
(moved)
Thank you, James.
LAVELLE nods and walks on.

104

104

EXT. BEACH - MORNING
LAVELLE comes down onto the beach. Looks around --

LAVELLE’s POV -- there is no one to be seen on the beach.
But far off, some SURFERS are riding the waves.
He strides out, a lone figure out for a Sunday stroll. The
surf rolling in.
105

105

EXT. SAND DUNES - MORNING
MICHEÁL is painting with oils. A canvas set up on an
easel. He pauses -MICHEÁL’s POV -- LAVELLE looking out to sea. And then a
second MAN, approaching from the right.

106

EXT. BEACH - MORNING

106

LAVELLE turns and sees the MAN approaching -(CONTINUED)

106

91.
106

CONTINUED:

LAVELLE’s POV -- the MAN gradually defines himself as JACK
BRENNAN. Wearing a plain white shirt, the cuffs turned up,
ordinary black trousers, black shoes.
As BRENNAN nears LAVELLE, he takes a gun from a trouser
pocket and holds it loosely at his side.
BRENNAN
Take your hands out of your pockets.
Slowly.
LAVELLE
Why?
BRENNAN
I heard you had a gun.
LAVELLE slowly removes his hands from the pockets of his
soutane and turns them palms up.
BRENNAN
Have to say I’m surprised. Thought
I’d have to go looking for you.
LAVELLE
Just because I’m here, doesn’t mean
you have to go through with it.
BRENNAN
Yes it does. It’s one of those...
self-fulfilling prophecies.
Did you really think it’d come to
this, though, hah?
LAVELLE
I was hoping it wouldn’t. I thought
you were a friend of mine.
BRENNAN
Ah sure, a friend is just an enemy
you haven’t made yet.
LAVELLE
Cheap cynicism.
BRENNAN
No, not cheap, now. That’s a cynicism
that was hard-won. That’s a cynicism
that was earned after a hell of a lot
of psychological and physical torture.
LAVELLE
I take it back, then. But it’s
cynicism all the same. That’s the
difference between us, I suppose.
BRENNAN
That’s not the only difference.

BRENNAN looks out over the waves. LAVELLE appraising him.
BRENNAN
Any regrets?
LAVELLE
Yeah. I never got to finish Moby Dick.
BRENNAN
The whale kills Ahab.
LAVELLE
Is that right?
BRENNAN
Then he destroys the rest of the
ship and the crew along with it.
All except for Ishmael. He alone
escapes to tell thee.
They look at each other for a long moment.
LAVELLE
The burning of the church I understand. But you didn’t have to kill
my dog.
BRENNAN
I didn’t kill your dog.
Why would I do a thing like that?
LAVELLE
I found him. Out in the field.
His throat had been cut.
BRENNAN
Nothing to do with me. I am wholly
innocent of that crime.
(pause)
I did give Veronica a shove that
one time, though. I admit that and
I’m sorry for it.
(pause)
Did it upset you? The dog?

LAVELLE
Yes it did.

BRENNAN
Did you cry?
LAVELLE
Yes I did.
BRENNAN
That’s nice. And when you read about
what your fellow priests did to all
those poor children down all those
years, did you cry then?
LAVELLE looks blankly at him.
BRENNAN
I asked you a question. Did you cry
then?
LAVELLE
No.
BRENNAN
That’s right.
LAVELLE
No, I suppose-BRENNAN
Yeah?
LAVELLE
I suppose I felt detached from it.
The way you are when you read anything in a newspaper or see it on
televis-BRENNAN raises the gun and fires --

LAVELLE is hit in the lower left side and staggers back,
collapsing onto the sand.
BRENNAN
Detach yourself from that.

BRENNAN
We were the lucky ones, though.
There are bodies buried back there.
Buried like dogs.
LAVELLE puts his hand over the wound once more, feeling
the blood pulsing out. He looks around --

LAVELLE’s POV -- the beach. The SURFERS. BRENNAN. The sky.
BRENNAN approaches LAVELLE and aims the gun at his head.

BRENNAN
Don’t look at me. Turn your face to
the side.
LAVELLE holds his gaze.
BRENNAN hesitates. Hears a sound and turns --

MICHEÁL appears, running and tumbling down from the dunes
and out onto the beach -BRENNAN turns his aim on MICHEÁL -LAVELLE
No!
MICHEÁL pauses, looking from BRENNAN to LAVELLE -LAVELLE
Run, Micheál!
MICHEÁL
I’ll get Stanton, Father!
HELICOPTER SHOT -- MICHEÁL retreats and runs towards the
town. BRENNAN turns back to LAVELLE.

He starts to sob. He moves off towards the surf, trying to
regain his composure.
LAVELLE watches him, his face turning pale as the life
ebbs from him.
LAVELLE
It’s not too late, Jack.
BRENNAN
(still sobbing)
Yes it is. Yes it is.
He turns back, wiping his tears with his gun-hand. He
takes a deep breath, then aims the gun at LAVELLE again.
BRENNAN
Say your prayers.

I’ve already said them.
