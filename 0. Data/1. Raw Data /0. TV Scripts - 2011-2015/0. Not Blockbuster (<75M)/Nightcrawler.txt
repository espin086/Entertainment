1-800-GET-THIN

it could be the moon ... CAMERA pushing over a rim to show
LOS ANGELES
shimmering in night heat ... THRUM of civilization ... a
FREEWAY feeds into the city as a SEMI blasts by and CUT TO
A COYOTE
loping across a RESIDENTIAL STREET in the hills ... it stops
under a street lamp ... darting away and CUT TO
THE L.A. RIVER
flows darkly before us ... CAMERA rising above a FLOOD
CHANNEL to a fenced industrial area where
LOUIS “LOU” BLOOM
is a silhouette against the city glow ... using bolt cutters
to rip down a square of chain-link fence ... muscling it into
the back of a beat-up CAR as he hears something, turns to SEE
HEADLIGHTS
approaching in the distance ... LOU slamming the trunk as the
lights
SWEEP
and we see him ... LOU’S mid-20s ... pure primal id ... if
there’s music it’s in his head ... disconnected ... feral ...
driven by dollar signs and a dream of some imagined Eden as
A PICK-UP TRUCK
stops and a MAN gets out ... framed in headlights ... wearing
a utility belt with mace and handcuffs ...
MAN’S VOICE
What are you doing out here?
I’m lost.

LOU

2.
MAN’S VOICE
This is a restricted area.
LOU
I didn’t know that.

There’s no signs.

MAN
They’re everywhere.

Let’s see some I.D.

Why?

LOU

MAN
Because there’s a broken gate back there
and you’re trespassing.
LOU
Excuse me, but that gate was open, sir.
I was under the opinion that it was a
detour. What kind of uniform is that?
MAN
I’ll ask the fucking questions.
LOU seeing a SECURITY EMBLEM on the man’s sleeve ...
LOU
Private outfit, huh? I tried to get one
of those jobs. I like guarding things.
(pulling a license)
Here you go, sir. I think what happened
is I just must’ve gotten turned around.
The MAN reaches for LOU’S license and CLOSE ON
A CHUNKY WATCH
on the MAN’S wrist ... minute hand ticking 1:19 AM as
LOU
attacks ... fight going to ground ... dust rising into the
headlights and CUT TO
LOU’S CAR
gliding along an endless VALLEY BOULEVARD ... shut stores and
deserted parking lots ... street lights on every empty corner
... like a movie set waiting for the next day’s shooting ...
LOU’S hand shifts on the steering wheel as he admires
THE GUARD’S WATCH
on his wrist ... industrial ROAR bleeding in and CUT TO

3.
A GIANT MACHINE
eating CARS at the edge of the valley ... night CREW craning
junkers into grinding blades as
INSIDE THE OFFICE
LOU speaks to the SCRAPYARD OWNER over the noise ...
LOU
I guesstimate I have 50 pounds of copper
wire, a hundred pounds of chain-link and
two manhole covers, the nice thick ones.
SCRAPYARD OWNER
I’ll give 50-cents-a-pound for the wire,
15 for the fence and 10 for the covers.
LOU
That’s below market value.
SCRAPYARD OWNER
Market value? You know the cops came by
asking about manhole covers.
LOU
I’d like to counter at a dollar-a-pound
for the copper, 30-cents-a-pound for the
fence and 20-cents-per for the covers.
SCRAPYARD OWNER
Sell ‘em somewhere else.
LOU
I’d feel good at 75, 25 and 15.
SCRAPYARD
I’m not negotiating with you.
LOU
I think we’re close.
We’re done.

SCRAPYARD OWNER
Take it or leave it.

LOU
I’m willing to take less to establish a
business relationship. If that’s your
last best offer then I guess I accept.
SCRAPYARD OWNER
Drive around back and unload ‘em.

4.
LOU
Sir, excuse me, I’m looking for a job.
In fact, I’ve made up mind to find a
career I can learn and grow into. Who am
I? I’m a hard-worker, I set high goals
and I've been told I'm persistent. Now
I’m not fooling myself, sir. Having been
raised with the self-esteem movement so
popular in schools, I used to expect my
needs to be considered. But I know that
today’s work culture no longer caters to
the job loyalty that could be promised to
earlier generations. What I believe,
sir, is that good things come to those
who work their asses off, and that people
such as yourself who reach the top of the
mountain didn’t just fall there. My
motto is if you want to win the lottery
you have to make the money to buy a
ticket. Did I say I worked in a garage?
Sir, I think you and I could work well
together. So how about it? I can start
tomorrow or even why not tonight?
SCRAPYARD OWNER filling out a form ... muttering ‘no’ ...
LOU
How about an internship then? A lot of
young people are taking unpaid positions
to get a foot in the door. That’s
something I’d be willing to do.
SCRAPYARD OWNER
I’m not hiring a fucking thief.
DEAD OF NIGHT
as LOU drives an empty valley boulevard ... holding his
CELL PHONE
on the steering wheel ... surfing a SEX HOOK-UP WEBSITE as
PHOTOS OF NEAR NAKED WOMEN
with their locations are shown ... LOU stops scrolling on
A WOMAN
in her 40s, semi-clothed and
LOU
turns the phone ... snaps a smiling self-portrait and CUT TO

A DINER
wall clock clicking 2:42 AM ... LOU arranging silverware ...
checking his reflection in a spoon ... watching the door as
THE WOMAN
whose photo we saw enters ... coat over a nurse’s uniform ...
older than her photo ... LOU stands, smiling, as she sits ...
Hi.

I’m Lou.

No names.

LOU
WOMAN

LOU
That’s not my real name anyway.
WOMAN
Jesus you’re young.
LOU
You’re in health care.
I just got off.

WOMAN

LOU
Can I take your coat?
No.

WOMAN

LOU
I got us some menus. The soup today is
potato. There’s a special for 3.75 that
comes with half a sandwich.
I’m not eating.

WOMAN

LOU
So. What do you have to do to become a
nurse?
Get a degree.
What kind?

WOMAN
LOU

WOMAN
LVN’s vocational. Registered’s an ADN.

LOU
I’ll bet those cost money.
Well yeah.

WOMAN

LOU
What about automation?
What?

WOMAN

LOU
I recently read an article explaining
that machines aren’t just assisting
workers anymore but actually kicking them
out of their jobs. I’m wondering if
you’re seeing any of that in your work?
WOMAN
Look, I got 30 minutes to get home. My
husband caught me doing this before.
LOU
My wife gave me this watch.
WOMAN
Did you read my ad?
LOU
I don’t think so. I was driving.
WOMAN
I’m not into guys who are nice.
like it rough.
Okay.

I mean I

LOU
I’m sure I can do that.

WOMAN
We’ll use my car.
LOU stands, leaves with her and CUT TO
LOU
alone in his car, driving an L.A. FREEWAY ... windows down

accident up ahead ... passes

TWO HIGHWAY PATROLMEN

LOU

JOE
Whoever pays the most.
LOU
What do you get for something like this?
Not much.

JOE

LOU
Enough to buy all that gear.
JOE
It’s a flaming asshole of a job.
LOU
How do you sell what you shoot?
JOE ignoring him, loading equipment in the van ...
LOU
Can I ask you, are you currently hiring?
No.

JOE

LOU
Well thank you for taking the time to
discuss what you do. You’ve been very
helpful.

This is a custom racing bicycle, ma’am,

This bike has a lightweight, space-age
carbon frame and handlebars positioned to
put the rider in a more aerodynamic

37 gears and weighs under six pounds. I

WOMAN/ON SCREEN
It was probably like 10:30 or 11 an’ she
told me she heard a girl yelling so like
she knew something was wrong an’ then a
bang so now she's like wow maybe that got
something to do with what happened ... I
mean he was nice, I used to see him all
the time...
NINA
Cut from ‘she heard yelling’ to ‘and then
a bang’ and then I want to lay over some
nat sound. Let’s loop the neighbor’s dog
barking and then try taking the crying
kid from b roll and dropping that in the
background.
NINA sees LOU at the door ...

NINA
What do you have?
LOU
Something I’m fairly certain you’ll be
excited about.
What is it?

NINA

LOU
It’s a shooting. A man is shot, several
times in fact, and he’s lying on the
ground. He’s bleeding on the ground. I
would be surprised if he survived,
honestly. He was shot during a carjacking.
NINA
From Motor and Washington?
LOU
Yes, that’s right.
NINA
I heard Seven had the exclusive.
LOU
No. I was there and I was much closer to
what was happening.
NINA
Well let’s see it.
LOU
(hands her his camcorder)
You can watch it on the little screen.
NINA
You’ve never done this before.
Yes.

editor.

Play it back.
FRANK
watches LOU’S footage ... winces at the gore ...
NINA
That’s the lead. I want to break it up
and do a wrap-around from the scene.
Let’s get Joel rolling. I want a walking
stand-up. Teaser at five and repeat on
the half. I want the copy to start with
a warning.

22.
FRANK
You’re going to show this?
With a warning.
It’s excessive.

NINA
FRANK

NINA
We should have packages like this every
day.
FRANK
People are eating breakfast.
NINA
And they’ll talk about it at work. Tie
it in with the carjacking last month in
Glendale and the other one, the van in
Palms, when was that? March. It’s a
carjacking crime wave. That’s the
banner. Call the victim’s family. Get a
quote. Mike it. You know what to do.
(to LOU)
How much?
LOU
Well, I’m selling this particular piece
for ten thousand. I think at that price
there’s a lot of value in it for you.
NINA
Not even close. This late you have no
where else to go. And the quality’s for
shit. I’ll give you a 1000, that’s the
most I’ll do. Now let’s get you paid.
NINA’S OFFICE
Work clutter ... impersonal ... impermanent ... LOU alone ...
looking around as ... NINA comes in, hands him a check ...
NINA
Buy some better equipment. A directional
mike. Get interviews when you can. You
have a good eye.
LOU
Thank you. I’m just beginning so praise
from someone such as yourself, well you
can imagine it means quite a lot.

23.
NINA
I’ll help anyway I can. And of course,
you can help me by calling us first. I
want you to contact me when you have
something.
LOU
Something like this?
That’s right.
Bloody.

NINA
LOU

NINA
That’s only part of it. We like crime.
Not all crime. A carjacking in Compton,
for example, that isn’t news, now is it?
We find our viewers are more interested
in urban crime creeping into the suburbs.
What that means is a victim or victims,
preferably well-off and/or white, injured
at the hands of the poor, or a minority.
Just crime?

LOU

NINA
No. Accidents play. Cars, buses,
trains, planes. Fires. Suicides.
But bloody.

LOU

NINA

CARJACKING CRIME WAVE
The ANCHORS appear, suitably breathless ...
ANCHORWOMAN
A tragic drug store visit to help his
ailing wife claimed the life of a loving
husband last night in Culver City.
Reporting from the scene is Joel Beatty.
The REPORTER begins a walking stand-up toward the policetaped crime scene ...
REPORTER
An act of kindness turned into a savage,
deadly attack outside this Walgreen’s on
Washington Boulevard at 2 am when 68-yearold David Keller of Mar Vista was walking
toward his car with a prescription for
his sick wife and was confronted right
here by a black male with a 9mm handgun
who police believe tried to take his
vehicle. The vicious tragedy and
senselessness of the brutal shooting as
well as the victim’s last moments were
captured in graphic footage we are about
to air. Viewer discretion is advised.

FRANK
I don’t like it.

NINA walks LOU onto the news set ... TECHS prepping ...
LOU
I liked how you handled Frank. You
didn’t soften the truth or dilute it. I
think being clear with your objectives is
more important than trying to present
ideas in a non-confrontational manner.
NINA
You have experience in an office?
Myself?

LOU
Not presently, no.

NINA
So where’d you get all that?
LOU
I study a lot on-line.
Yeah.

What?

NINA

LOU circling the news set ... taking it in as he talks ...

36.
LOU
Well, all sorts of things, actually. I’m
on my computer all day. I haven’t had
what you’d call much formal education but
you can find most anything if you look
hard enough. Last year I took an on-line
business course, for example. I learned
you have to have a business plan before
starting a business, and that why you
pursue something is as important as what
you pursue. The site advised you to
answer the following question before
deciding where to focus your abilities.
The question was ‘What do I love to do?’
The site suggested making a list of my
strengths and weaknesses. What are you
good at? And what are you not that good
at? Maybe you want to strengthen and
develop knowledge about the things you’re
already good at. Or maybe you might want
to strengthen your weaknesses. I
recently remade my list and I’m thinking
now that television news might just be
something that I love as well as
something that I happen to be good at.
LOU stops at the large, high-def L.A. backdrop ...
LOU
On tv it looks real.
NINA
Yes it does. Well, I have a show to do.

K.S.M.L. EXCLUSIVE
Horror In Westchester

38.
REPORTER/OVER
This sleepy Westchester lane erupted in
gunfire at approximately 1:20 last night,
with sheriff’s deputies telling K.S.M.L.
that over 30 shots were exchanged in a
shootout that left two unidentified but
alleged drug users dead in the foreclosed
home behind me. But the horror was only
beginning inside the neighboring house
where Robert and Cathy Cahill were left
frantically checking their baby daughter
for injuries after the barrage shattered
the safety, as well as their windows and
rooms, with high-caliber bullets.
The inside of the couple’s house is seen ... money shot of
the family photo on the bullet-pierced fridge ...
REPORTER/OVER
Police investigators are now mounting a
massive search for the gunmen, with one
senior official telling K.S.M.L. that it
was a miracle innocent victims weren’t
injured or killed in the shootout. That
official also conveyed concern for the
very real possibility of more gunplay in
other L.A. neighborhoods, urging all
Southland residents to exercise caution
by locking their doors and windows.

JOE
Great get tonight. They were closing it
down by the time we showed up.
LOU
Were you waiting for me out here?
JOE
I was driving by and saw your car. You
need an air-card if you really wanna be a
mobile station. Import the video to the
laptop, cut the video, upload to your FTP
site and notify the stations you got
something for sale. Boom boom boom.
LOU listens ... acting less interested than he really is ...
JOE
Otherwise it’s a nice ride. I had a ‘97
Challenger but lost it in a divorce. The
laws of California aren’t friendly to
alimony payments. You got a good run
going but there’s valleys out there.
Believe me, I’ve been nightcrawling eight
years. You hear I’m adding a second van?
LOU
I didn’t hear that.
JOE
Gonna be a game changer. Cut our onscene time in half. And I’m setting up a
dedicated dispatch. No more listening
and driving. You like the Canon 300s?
LOU
I never used one.
JOE

I got one with your name on it.
LOU
I have a camera.

JOE
I want you running my second van. Two
crews. Half the territory to cover. Now
I know what you’re thinking, half the
money. But it also means twice the sales
‘cause we’re gonna be first at the scene.
Why compete when we can work together?
You can use my press cards. Puppydog off
my police connections. This is the big
move. The next level. We can corner
this whole thing. I’m talking about
putting some heavy digits in our pockets.
LOU
Thanks for offering me the position but
working for myself is more in line with
my skills and career goals.
JOE
Take a few days to think about it.
LOU
No. You’ll need to hire someone else and
I don’t want to hold up the process.
JOE
You want to be on the inside of this.
I’m gonna be tag-teaming every call.
LOU
You keep talking like it’s something I
might be interested in but I’m not.
JOE
You don’t even understand the offer. If
you did you’d be asking questions. What
does this mean? What does that mean?
LOU
I feel like grabbing you by your ears and
screaming in your face I’m not fucking
interested. Instead I’m going to drive
home and do some accounting.

I’m sure you’re beautiful anytime of day.
In fact I’d say you’re much prettier than
Lisa Mays. I like the dark make-up on
your eyes. I also like how you smell.
NINA
Where are you from, Lou?
LOU
The north end of the valley. Some of the
calls sometimes take me over that way but
nobody I know is still out there. You’re
from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
NINA
How did you know that?
LOU
It’s online. Everything about you’s
online. Well not everything, but
definitely a lot. I’ve watched all the
videos from when you were a reporter.
I’m sure you look at them of course.
NINA
God no, not without a drink in my hand.
LOU
I watch my work all the time.
NINA
Do you want to become a reporter?
No.

LOU

NINA
Most of you guys want air-time.
LOU
Not me. I want to be the guy who owns
the station that owns the camera. The
business is doing well but I’m ready to
grow to the next level. To do that I
need to stay one step ahead of my
competition and take risks. I also need
financial support to implement expansion.
Would you like another margarita?
One’s enough.

NINA

47.
LOU
Thanks for coming out to talk. The place
I’m in now is that I want a relationship
with somebody I can team up with and
share, like we share the same hours, the
same job and whatnot. I could go down a
laundry list but you get the idea.
NINA
I hope you find someone.
LOU
Here’s the thing about that, Nina, I’m
quite certain that I already have.
NINA
Okay, let me put this politely. I only
came out to dinner with you, Lou, purely
as a professional courtesy.
LOU
Thank you, because I don’t think it’s a
secret that I’ve single-handedly raised
the unit price on your ratings book.
NINA
Our ratings book price?
LOU
I’m a very fast learner, Nina. We had a
conversation and I specifically mentioned
that. Do you remember? Well do you?
Yes.

NINA

LOU
I recently learned, for instance, that
most Americans watch local news to stay
informed. I also learned that an average
half-hour of Los Angeles television news
packs all its local government coverage -including budget, law enforcement,
education, transportation and immigration
-- into 22 seconds. Local crime stories,
however, not only usually led the news
but filled 14 times the broadcast,
averaging 5 minutes 7 seconds. And
K.S.M.L. relies heavily on such stories.
With Los Angeles crime rates going down I
think that makes items like mine
particularly valuable, like rare animals.
I imagine your needs will only increase
during next week’s rating sweeps period.

48.
NINA
We certainly appreciate what you do.
LOU
There's certain good things in being
alone. You have time to do the things
you want to do, like study and plan. But
you can’t have dinners like this. Or be
physical with a person, I mean beyond a
flirtationship.
NINA
Where are you going with this?
LOU
I want that. With you. Like you want to
keep your job and your health insurance.
NINA
Look, just for starters I don’t need you
to keep my fucking job.
LOU
You’re the news director on the vampire
shift at the lowest rated station in L.A.
I have to think you’re invested in this
transaction.
NINA
Where did you get the balls to even
suggest something like this?
LOU
We’re still talking.
NINA
There’s nothing more to say.
You can leave.

LOU

NINA
You’ve done well. Okay? We pay you
well. Very well. We always have. If
you like, I can get you an exclusive
retainer, that would be on top of your
segment fees. I could maybe even get you
a job at the station, starting as a
production assistant, so you can learn
the business from the inside, that’s
where you said your interests lie, see
where it goes.

49.
LOU
You’re not listening, Nina. I happen to
know you haven’t stayed at one station
for more than two years at a time, and
you’re coming up on two years soon. So I
can imagine you have a contract for that
length of time and that ratings during
the next week will directly affect that.
NINA
You’re threatening if I don’t ...
LOU
I’m negotiating.
NINA
You’re threatening to stop selling to me.
LOU
That’s your choice. The true price of
any item is what someone’s willing to
pay. You want something and I want you.
To fuck you.

NINA

LOU
And as a friend.
NINA
Jesus Christ. Friends don’t pressure
friends to fucking sleep with them.
LOU
Actually that’s wrong, Nina. Because as
I’m sure you know ... a friend is a gift
you give yourself.

RICK
Left on Roth then six blocks to the ramp.
LOU
You’re putting me on the 5?
RICK
The 2 to the 5 to the 110 to the 10.
LOU
Did you read my traffic memo yesterday?
Did I read it?

RICK
Yeah.

I read it.

LOU
What did it say? About the 5?
I looked at it.

RICK
Okay, what?

LOU
Well for one thing it included the 5 has
floating construction in the fast lane
for the next three weeks. So knowing
that, I’d expect you to put me on the 2
to the 101 to the 110 to the 10.
RICK
Half of one, six of the other.
LOU
It’s half-dozen of one, six of the other.
What I’d like is for you to admit that
you didn’t read what you said you did. I
think you know that I’m a reasonable
person, but no one likes to be lied to.
RICK
Yeah, well when am I gonna get my raise?
I mean that’s reasonable, right? Like
you keep talking about this performance
review but when’s that gonna happen? Two
months and every night I’m here working
my ass off. I’m tired of your promises
for more pay, man. I’m sleeping in a
fucking garage ...
RICK launching into a monologue for more money ... his voice
joining the overlapping emergency chatter and
LOU
glances at the SPEEDOMETER NEEDLE fluttering at 90 as

RICK’S appeal for a raise until

Rick. Trying to leverage your salary in
this economic environment is near
impossible. Most firms have set starting
wages. Ideally, you could leverage with
other offers but that is just not the
case in your situation right now.

None of this is going to knock anybody

LOU
No, I have the stabbing in Corona.
NINA
Where’s the plane crash at Foothill?
LOU
I don’t mind saying that I’m trying to
bring you stories that happen here, on
the ground.
Four has it.

NINA
It’ll be their lead.

LOU
And I hope they do well with that, but
you should look at the Corona stabbing.

54.
NINA
I don’t give a goddamn about fucking
Corona. You know how important this week
is. This shit’s fucking death to me.
LOU
I understand your frustration. I guess
I’m trying not to be too hard on myself.
NINA
I sold you upstairs as some kind of
fucking sweeps savior and I’m leading
with a goddamn stabbing in Corona.
LOU
So you want that then?
NINA
I want you to get in the goddamn game.
want something that people can’t turn
away from. I want what you fucking
promised me.

I

LOU
We want the same thing. I’ll just have
to find two sticks and rub them together.
This is my work, Nina, and I don’t take
anything more seriously than that. Every

you that stabbing.

LOU
Since when did Laurel become faster than
Coldwater? What was the thinking there?
I didn’t ask that to hear myself speak.
RICK
Because Laurel only has six lights.
LOU
Coldwater has places to pass. I can’t
get around this person in front of us
until Ventura.
RICK
It’s the same argument. I said this
route and you should have said something
if you wanted to take Coldwater.

56.
LOU
I thought you’d worked in other factors.
If I didn’t think you could do better I
wouldn’t ride you about routes. You have
to know that, Rick. I think it’s just
possible that I have a higher opinion of
you than you have of yourself.
LOU flooring it and passing

the hell happened?
LOU
According to witnesses they were driving
at a high rate of speed, probably heading
for Griffith Park, when they apparently
ran head-on into this light pole. No
other cars. Single-vehicle.
RICK
How do they just hit a pole?

Jesus.

Good brush fires are money. Code eight

RICK
(looking at the estates)
I hope they all burn, rich motherfuckers.
LOU
You’re living in backwardia, Rick. Most
of the government’s revenue comes from
the wealthy. I hear people all around me
talking how the rich only got that way by
screwing other people over. People say,
oh, they’ve got it all and I don’t, so
they’re evil. But that’s just jealousy.
You can’t hate what you want to become.
RICK
I don’t want to become them. They’re
zombies. They want to eat our brains.

LOU
You should have walked in and looked,
Rick. If you were half-curious. That’s
what I’m paying you to do. You need to
show initiative. There’s no better way
to achieve job security than by making
yourself an indispensable employee.
RICK
I heard gunshots. There was fucking
blood on the floor.
LOU
All the more reason. You might have
helped me. You might have learned a new
skill that made you more useful and put
us on a track toward growth.

I’ve been trying to reach you for the
last hour. In the future, when you don’t
have anything, man-up and don’t dodge my
fucking calls. It’s a waste of my time.
LOU
I do have something.
What?

NINA

LOU
I have a home invasion triple murder in
Grenada Hills.
NINA
That’s just breaking now.
LOU
We got there before the police.
You have it?

NINA

LOU
I’m not going to list the many benefits
of this piece. I think it’s best that
you probably just watch it for yourself.
NINA
I could have had someone out there by
now, why didn’t you call it in?
LOU
To increase your need and improve my
bargaining position.

NINA
Home invasion in Grenada. He got there
before the cops. It’s 10 minutes to air
time, how much of this can we show?
LINDA
You mean legally?
No, morally.

NINA
Of course legally.

LINDA
Have they been identified?
FRANK
It just happened, so you have to assume
no. And that’s just one of the issues.
LINDA
Well you can’t broadcast their identities
without notifying next of kin.
NINA
We’re not identifying them.

LINDA
You are by proxy by showing their faces.
NINA
We pixilate the faces.

Hello, Linda, I’m Lou.
JENNY
(re: the screen)
Oh Jesus, is there a dead baby inside
there?
LOU
No, the crib was empty.
NINA
For Christ’s sake, are we breaking the
law by showing this?
LINDA
Block the faces, don’t give the exact
home address, do that, I guess, I mean, I
don’t, I wouldn’t think so, no.
FRANK
Journalistically and ethically -NINA
This isn’t Hartford.
LOU
(re: the monitor)
Well, that’s mostly it right there. From
this point on I just went downstairs and

I’ve given you two.
5,000.

NINA

LOU
I got five for the food truck stabbings.
NINA
There were more dead.
LOU
Those were poor Mexican people in a roach
coach. Two of them were illegals. These
are three wealthy white people shot and
killed inside their mansion, including a
suburban wife shotgunned in her bed. I
know you, Nina. I know your interest and
excitement in this product is greater
than the amount you’re offering.

LOU
25,000. And that’s the absolute lowest
that I’ll go.
NINA
Can’t do it. Never happen. There’s the
matter of precedent. 15’s my last, best
offer.
LOU stands to leave ...
LOU

Okay.
Stop.

What?

NINA
Where are you going?

LOU
Seven’s approached me at least several
times. The ND there gave me his card. I
think Seven will offer more. It’s a five
minute drive.
Hold on.

NINA
Goddamn it.

20.

LOU

NINA
I can’t spend a month’s budget on a
single story.

70.
LOU
What if the story’s not over? The people
who did this escaped. They’re still out
there, walking around with the rest of
us. If I had a family and I lived in a
home that might make me nervous. I would
want updates on what was going on. With
this footage people will turn to your
channel for the story. Now I like you,
Nina, I look forward to our time
together, but you have to understand that
25,000 isn’t all that I want. From here
on, starting now, I want my work to be
credited by the anchors and on a burn.
The name of my company is Video News
Productions, a professional news
gathering service. That’s how it should
read and that’s how it should be said. I
also want to go to the next rung and meet
your team and the anchors and the
director and the station manager, to
begin developing my own personal
relationships. I’d like to start meeting
them this morning. You’ll take me around
and you’ll introduce me as the owner and
president of Video News and remind them
of some of my many other stories. I’m
not done. I also want to stop our
discussions over prices. This will save
time. So when I say a particular number
is my lowest price, that is my lowest
price and you can be sure I’ve arrived at
whatever that number is very carefully.
Now when I say I want these things I mean
that I want them and I don’t want to have
to ask again. And the last thing that I
want, Nina, is for you to do the things I
ask you to do when we’re alone together
at your apartment, not like the last
time.
NINA staring ...
LOU
Now. Tell you what. I have the van
crash on Moorpark tonight. It was a
couple of stringers, actually. That
could lead by itself on an average night.
I’d be willing to throw that in for free.
So. What do you say? Do we have a deal?
NINA
... I have to call corporate.

71.
LOU
I’m going to hang around while you put
this together. I’m really looking
forward to seeing how the news get made.

This is K.S.M.L. breaking news. In the
last half-hour we have received word of
an apparent home invasion triple homicide
in the Grenada Hills area of the San
Fernando Valley. At present that number,
that is the number of those dead, has not
been confirmed by police, but K.S.M.L.
has obtained exclusive footage from
inside the crime scene in which at least
three bodies can be observed. We are
going to show segments of that footage
throughout the broadcast and throughout
the day as we break for police updates
and information. Again, we’re about to
show exclusive K.S.M.L. video from inside
the crime scene.
NINA keying the ANCHORWOMAN’S ear-piece ...
It’s graphic.

NINA
Repeat it.

ANCHORWOMAN
Before broadcasting this video we want to
warn viewers that these are extremely
graphic images. We have obscured the
address and the faces as well as any
identifying details and apart from that,
this is mostly raw and unedited actual
footage again of a triple homicide home
invasion that has just occurred in the
upscale San Fernando neighborhood of
Grenada Hills.
Hit it again.

NINA/OVER EAR-PIECE
Harder. Then roll.

ANCHORWOMAN
We have a team of K.S.M.L. reporters
setting up at the scene that we will be
speaking with shortly after we show what
I must repeat is extremely graphic
footage and I’m hearing from the control
room that we have that and we’re going to
cue up that footage now.

This footage was obtained exclusively by
K.S.M.L. from Video News Productions, a
professional news gathering service. It
begins on the premises, inside the house,
and that is what appears to be blood on
the floor of the residence, leading into
what apparently is the living area, or a
living area, and there is the first body,
restrained it seems to a chair, again the
faces, all the faces, will be blurred.
They escaped.

NINA/OVER EAR-PIECE
They’re on the loose.

ANCHORWOMAN
And that is the first of what we
understand are three bodies in the home
in Grenada Hills, the result of what
early reports suggest was a home invasion
or robbery committed by a suspect or
suspects who at this time are believed to
have escaped. Who are still out there.
And that’s a very frightening thought.
INTERCUT: NINA keying the anchorman’s ear-piece ...

NINA

ANCHORMAN
It’s very concerning, particularly given
the savagery of what we’re seeing and
that looks to be the kitchen where you
can see another body on the floor, and
again I want to repeat, because it bears
repeating, that the person or people who
committed this brutal home invasion
robbery are presently unidentified and at
large, and that has to be a great worry
not only to residents in the Grenada
Hills area but-ANCHORWOMAN

We’re going to wait.
For what?

RICK

LOU
First we want to make sure he’s actually
inside. Then we want to find a more
interesting place to film the arrest.
Where?

RICK

LOU
Anywhere we want. What we’re going to do
is we’re going to wait for him to leave
and then we’re going to follow him. When
he reaches what would be considered a
better or more populated neighborhood
we’ll report his location to the police.
He’s a violent, wanted criminal. I have
to believe that he’s not going to just
peacefully surrender.
RICK
Okay, I want more money.

A lot more.

LOU
What makes a job desirable isn’t just the
dollar amount attached to it, Rick.
You’re on the ground floor of a growing
business. Your reward is a career.
RICK
Fuck that. You’re talking about some
fucked up shit and you’re asking me, you
just expect me to be part of it.

I can’t make people do things, Rick. You
have a choice to do this and I have a
choice if you don’t.

You gotta bring people in, man. I’m
serious. You gotta talk to ‘em like
they’re human beings. I’m saying this to

LAPD. Major case. Pull the footage on

All copies.
Can I help you?

NINA

DETECTIVE FRONTIERI
You can help yourself by collecting up
every copy you have of the shoot-out, the
chase, the crash -- all of it. Now.
NINA
It’s K.S.M.L. property.
It’s evidence.
Of what?

DETECTIVE FRONTIERI
I got a cop near death in the hospital,
two dead and four wounded in a Wendys and
a dozen major crimes stretching five
miles of Pico. That tape is evidence.
NINA
It’s news footage bought and paid for
from an independent contractor.
DETECTIVE FRONTIERI
How do you think he got it?
NINA
If there’s an issue speak to him.
DETECTIVE FRONTIERI
Don’t get in the way of this.

Unless you have a judge’s order we’re
going with it in four minutes.

Joel’s got a source in the sheriff’s
department who says they’ve found drugs
at the Grenada Hills house. Cocaine in
wrapped packages hidden in a crawlspace.
Over 50 pounds. He’s confirmed it with
an investigator at the scene. It wasn’t
a home invasion, it was a drug robbery.
NINA
Give it to the noon crew.
This is news.

FRANK

NINA
It detracts from the story.
FRANK
It is the story.
NINA
The story is urban crime creeping into
the suburbs. Innocent victims. That’s
the story.

Jesus, you sound like Lou.

I think Lou is inspiring all of us to
reach a little higher.

DETECTIVE FRONTEIRI
Would you tell me how it is you were at
the Wendys tonight and called in the 911?
LOU
Of course. I’m happy to. It began
earlier in the day. I was watering my
plant and I looked out my window at my
apartment, the one you visited, and I saw
a dark colored car with two men parked
across the street. I didn’t think much
about it, otherwise I would have reported
it then. We began our night, my employee
and myself, and around approximately
12:38 I looked in the rear view mirror
and saw that we were being followed by
what looked to be the same men in the
same car. I made an evasive maneuver,
circled back and tailed them to the
Wendy’s, at which time I witnessed them
go inside and I recognized them as the
men from the home invasion.
DETECTIVE FRONTEIRI
You told me you didn’t see the men, that
you didn’t get a good look at them.
LOU
Well it came back to me when I saw them
going in. Their shapes and their
movements. Then I saw that one of them
had a gun under his shirt and so of
course I immediately got my phone and I
called 911.
DETECTIVE FRONTEIRI
And started filming.
Exactly.

LOU
That’s what I do.

DETECTIVE FRONTEIRI
That’s your story?
LOU
That’s what happened. That’s why I’m
here talking to you. I think they
tracked me down after seeing my footage.
DETECTIVE FRONTEIRI
Would you like to know what I think?
Yes, please.

LOU

105.
DETECTIVE FRONTEIRI
I think you withheld information. I
think you saw the two men at the murder
house in Grenada Hills and you saw the
car and you sat on it to start something
you could film. What do you think about
that?
LOU
I think it would be very unprofessional
for someone to do that in my business.
DETECTIVE FRONTEIRI
It would be murder.
LOU
I can understand why you’re looking into
it but I didn’t do anything like that,
nothing that could be considered wrong.
DETECTIVE FRONTEIRI
You left the scene of an accident.
LOU
I wasn’t involved in the accident.
