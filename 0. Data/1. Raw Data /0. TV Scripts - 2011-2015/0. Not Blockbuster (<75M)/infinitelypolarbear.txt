Infinitely Polar Bear
By
Maya Forbes

EXT. COUNTRYSIDE. DAY
A man strides up a grassy hill. He is in his late-30s, cleanshaven with shaggy hair. He wears a well-cut tweed riding
jacket, jodhpurs and riding boots. He carries a large
shillelagh which rests on his shoulder.
This is CAM STUART.

Laid out on the surface of the rock is a cheap fake beard.
He looks around. There is not a person or a building in
sight. The tall grass bends in the wind.
EXT. HILLSIDE.

DAY

Cam, now wearing the fake beard, stands on the rock, gazing
out imperiously. He takes several deep breaths through his
nose, appreciating the fresh air. Then he jumps off the
boulder and continues his song as he marches down the hill.

In the darkness, we hear:

Girls, wake up. Wake up.

A flashlight clicks on.

It swings between two sleeping

Two bi-racial girls are sprawled out asleep on their beds.
AMELIA is ten; FAITH is eight. Cam shakes them. They resist
waking. He pulls their twisted covers off.
CAM
Rise and shine.
Finally they sit up. They blink at him, disoriented,
shielding their eyes from the glare of the flashlight.
CAM (CONT'D)
Happy birthday, Amelia.
Amelia turns on her bedside lamp.
AMELIA
It’s not my birthday.
Cam is disheveled and dirty, still wearing the tweed riding
jacket, jodhpurs, riding boots and fake beard. His eyes are
wide, wet and burning.
AMELIA
You look ridiculous.

Do you like it?

Mommy

FAITH
You smell like mothballs.
CAM
Good nose, Faithie. This riding
outfit belonged to Great-Grandpapa.
We’re exactly the same size.
Cam admires the craftsmanship of the jacket.

The girls

CAM
Hand-stitched by blind nuns.
AMELIA
Wasn’t everything hand-stitched
back then?
CAM
Not by blind nuns.
FAITH
Where’s Mommy?
Sleeping.

CAM
Shhh.

Faith collapses back onto her pillow, whimpering.
EXT. HILL. DAY
Cam, without the fake beard, marches up the hill as the sun
comes up. His daughters hurry behind him, still half-asleep.
They both wear sweaters over their nightgowns. He stops to
look at the sunrise and takes a long drag on his cigarette.
CAM
It’s going to be one hell of a hot
day.
FAITH
I’m freezing.
She looks like she’s going to cry.
CAM
Take my jacket, Faithie. I don’t
need it. Are you cold, Amelia?
He puts his jacket on Faith. Teeth chattering, Amelia shakes
her head no. Cam pats her approvingly on the head.
CAM
Tough cookie.
She smiles with pride, shivering.
EXT. FOREST. DAY
Cam and the girls traipse through the woods, each one of them
searching for something on the ground. Sunlight filters
through the hundred-year-old trees. The air is humming and
buzzing. It feels like summer.

4.
Suddenly Cam kneels by a rotten tree trunk.
WHISTLE.

He gives a sharp

His daughters run to him. The ground is covered with bright
orange chanterelles. They are beautiful. They seem to glow
in the shade of the tall trees. The girls are mesmerized.
FAITH
I wish I had a gown that color.
He holds out his hand and they each slap him five, laughing.
INT. HOUSE IN THE COUNTRY - KITCHEN. DAY
The chanterelles sizzle in a cast-iron pan. Cam stirs them
gently, still wearing the jodhpurs but no jacket or shirt.
He also wears a battered old gray fedora with a small freshlypicked flower stuck in the band. A cigarette dangles from
his lips. His gut hangs out. An attractive African-American
woman in her mid-30s leans against the kitchen counter. She
wears a housecoat. She looks tired. This is MAGGIE.
CAM
That’s what education should be
about. Hands-on, in the field.
(calling loudly)
You girls are fierce mushroomhunters!
MAGGIE
They’re in bed. Exhausted.
CAM
It’s good for them to see the
sunrise. They’re too stuck in
their cozy little routines.
MAGGIE
They’re ten and eight.
A long loaded silence.

Then:

MAGGIE (CONT'D)
You haven’t been taking your
lithium.
Cam picks up the cast iron pan and slams it down hard on the
burner. Maggie jumps and screams, startled. She turns and
hurries away.
CAM
God damn it!

5.
INT. HOUSE IN THE COUNTRY - LIVING ROOM. DAY
Toys are scattered everywhere. A coffee table lies on its
side. Cam holds a pack of cigarettes in each hand. His face
is enraged. Maggie rushes away from him. He follows her.
The girls watch from the upstairs landing.
CAM
My grandfather started the Harvard
Forestry School -- I’m trying to
bestow some of his legacy to my
children -- and you’re hassling me
about lithium!
MAGGIE
I’m calling Dr. Wendell.
Cam steps in front of her and smashes the phone out of the
wall. He kicks a zebra skin drum across the floor.
MAGGIE (CONT'D)
We live in this house -He jabs his finger in her face.
CAM
You’re just like my parents. You
want to keep me doped! Depressed!
Fat! Slow! You’d neuter me if you
could!
MAGGIE
(like speaking to a child)
Your parents let us live in this
house on the condition that you
remain stable -CAM
To hell with the house then! I’m
not going to let my goddamn parents
use it as a choke chain!
MAGGIE
How could you not take it?!
could you do that to us?!

How

He suddenly drops to his knees, maudlin and melodramatic and
overcome with sincere emotion. He holds onto her housecoat.
CAM
It kills me, Maggie. The girls and
I had a beautiful morning. It was
magical. That doesn’t happen when
I take my lithium.

CAM (cont'd)
Don’t you understand? Please tell
me you understand.
He looks so desperate that she wants to say she understands.
But she can’t. He reacts with another 180-degree turn, back
to anger. He pounds the floor repeatedly.
CAM (CONT'D)
You know what? Forget it. I’m
going to find someone who gets it.
Who gets me!
Cam turns and rips open the front door. He marches down the
sloping lawn, swiftly and stiffly like a soldier.
Maggie runs to the open door.
MAGGIE
That’s just an excuse to get laid!
CAM
(without looking back)
It’s a chance to be understood!
MAGGIE
By getting laid!
CAM
Boo hoo hoo! Poor bourgeois Maggie
and her bourgeois monogamous
fantasy!
EXT. DRIVEWAY. LATER
Maggie, wearing a crochet dress and knee-high boots, throws
garbage bags stuffed with clothes and toys into the trunk of
a pale blue Saab. The two little girls watch their frantic
mother. Amelia holds the entire “Little House on the
Prairie” series; Faith hugs eight different Barbie Dolls.
Cam appears at the end of the long driveway, riding his
bicycle uphill. He is now wearing a red Speedo, thin-soled
canvas tennis shoes, and a red bandana tied around his neck.
It is a ridiculous get-up. When he sees Maggie, he starts
shouting.
Hey! Hey!
Hold it!

CAM
Hold it, god damnit!

MAGGIE
(to her daughters)
Get in, get in!

7.
CAM
That is my car and those are my
children! Feeble, Maggie, pretty
fucking feeble!
He pedals faster as Maggie pushes her daughters into the car.
She dives in after them, pulls the door shut and locks all
the doors.

Cam races up and crashes his bike hard into the car.

Maggie slides into the driver’s seat and fumbles for the
right key. She drops her key ring on the floor.
Cam circles the car, gesturing wildly. He sounds faraway
through the glass but he is roaring. The girls stare at him.
CAM
Goddamnit, Maggie! I am a man!
am a man! Men like to screw!
That’s what we do!

I

MAGGIE
Amelia, Faith. Cover your ears.
They don’t. They watch in disbelief as Cam pounds his chest
and roars unto the skies:
CAM (CONT'D)
That’s why we have balls!
Then he rips open the hood and reaches into the engine.
Maggie finds the right key, puts it in the ignition and turns
it. Nothing. She turns it again. Nothing.
Cam slams the hood down and grins through the windshield.

bright and wet and insane. He holds the distributor cap.

I’m never going to let you go.

He

I

Both girls stare at him, completely still. Cam looks back at
them and sees their terrified faces looking out at him and
his face changes. A profoundly sad expression comes over
him. An expression of regret.

8.

I’m sorry.

CAM

He staggers backwards, puts his hands in front of his face
and sinks to the driveway cross-legged. He doesn’t move.
INT. SAAB. LATER
Maggie sits in the backseat, between the girls. Faith is on
her knees, braiding her mother’s hair. Amelia looks out the
window. Cam hasn’t moved. His bare shoulders are beet red.
AMELIA
He’s sitting on the gravel and all
he’s wearing is a bathing suit.
MAGGIE
Sweetie, your father is very sick
right now. He’s not himself.
AMELIA
He’s really sunburned.
Listen.

MAGGIE
Look at me.

She does.
MAGGIE (CONT'D)
I don’t want you to tell your
friends or teachers about any of
this. We know your father’s a good
person and he would never hurt us,
but it’s hard for people to
understand and it’s very sad.
Okay? Okay?
Amelia nods.
EXT. DRIVEWAY. DUSK
Two policeman lay a blanket over Cam’s shoulders and help him
into the back of their police car. Cam is docile and does
not resist. The girls watch from an upstairs bedroom.
INT. MCLEAN HOSPITAL VISITING ROOM. DAY
Maggie and the girls sit side-by-side on the couch of the
visiting room of McLean Hospital.

9.
Amelia is engrossed in “Watership Down.” Faith is making two
Barbie dolls kiss passionately and whispering. The room is
pale green, filled with tranquil watercolors.
A nurse holds the door open. Cam enters. He moves slowly
and he is hunched over, bloated and slow. He has a shaggy
beard. He wears an oversized stained t-shirt with an idiotic
logo and sweatpants. His hands tremble.
Daddy!

AMELIA/FAITH

They run to him and hug him around the waist. He pats their
heads with swollen hands. His speech is thick and slurred.
CAM
Little. Big Little. I loved your
letters. I’m feeling much better.
They are disturbed by his appearance.
You are?

AMELIA

FAITH
Your stomach is really big.
CAM
That’s the medication they put me
on. Doesn’t hurt. Go on, hit it.
He stands tall and sticks his lithium gut out.
their heads.
Come on.

They shake

CAM
Pound on it.

He slaps it again to show how hard it is. Amelia punches him
half-heartedly in the stomach. He tenses his muscles.
Harder.

CAM (CONT’D)
Let’s go.

Amelia complies with a flurry of little fists.
away from her.

Cam shuffles

CAM
Okay, okay. Remember. Never do
that when Harry Houdini’s not
ready. That’s how they killed him.
Cam sits down across from Maggie and indicates for the girls
to climb into his lap. They do. He lights a cigarette with
unsteady hands and smiles at Maggie through the smoke.

10.
CAM
You’re a sight for sore eyes.
MAGGIE
What happened to the clothes I
brought you?
CAM
There were too many buttons on
shirts. And...
(searching)
...latches on pants.
MAGGIE
How are you feeling?
CAM
(ruefully)
I feel great.
Maggie looks concerned.
MAGGIE
You seemed better last week. Are
they adjusting your medication?
CAM
Yeah, they’re trying something new
on me...
(standing up)
I want to sit down.
Cam starts shuffling around the room again.
CAM
I want to sit down. I want to be
home with my family.
AMELIA
You will, Daddy!
Cam smiles at them.
stiffly.

Then, abruptly, he starts to sing,

CAM
“When Daddy comes marching home
again, hurrah hurrah...
We’ll give him a hearty welcome
then, hurrah hurrah...
The men will cheer and the boys
will shout, hurrah hurrah...
the ladies they will all turn out,

CAM (cont'd)
(pauses, re-sets)
“When Daddy comes marching home
again, hurrah hurrah...
He holds his arms out.

The girls go to him and sing along.

ALL FOUR
“We’ll give him a hearty welcome
then, hurrah hurrah...
The men will cheer and the boys
will shout, hurrah hurrah,
the ladies they will all turn out,
hurrah hurrah...
Their singing continues over:
EXT. APARTMENT COMPLEX. DAY
Two large brick apartment buildings face each other across a
parking lot. It is an urban environment.
INT. APARTMENT. DAY
Maggie and the girls look around a vacant two-bedroom
apartment. It is clean and bright and sunny. Maggie nods at
the SUPERINTENDENT.
Amelia looks very worried. Maggie goes to the window and
points, trying to be upbeat.
MAGGIE
Look, girls. There’s a swimming
pool. It’ll be open in the summer.
Amelia looks out. In between the two matching apartment
buildings is a pool enclosed by a chain link fence. Next to
the pool area is a concrete “park” area with metal picnic
tables. Across from the building they are in is the other
building, staring back at them.
AMELIA
Daddy loves swimming.
Maggie doesn’t respond.
INT. WALDEN STREET APARTMENT - KITCHEN/DINING ROOM. DAY
Maggie and the girls have moved in. The apartment is clean
and spare. Marimekko prints cover simple Swedish furniture.
The sunniest corner is full of hanging plants. Maggie has
made it pleasant.

12.
Maggie is in the kitchen cooking dinner.
The girls sit at the dining room table. Amelia is doing her
math homework. Faith wears an all-lavender outfit and she is
carving a flower design into the antique mahogany table with
the pointy handle of a fork.
They pepper Maggie with questions and complaints.
AMELIA
The roof lights come in our window
at night and it’s too bright. I
can’t sleep. It’s bright as day.
MAGGIE (O.S.)
Maybe I can make a curtain for your
room.
AMELIA
Mommy, they’re huge security
lights. Like you would see at a
prison.
MAGGIE (O.S.)
Amelia, I also wish we could’ve
stayed out in the country, but
there were no good jobs in Sudbury.
FAITH
Your job here isn’t good.
MAGGIE (O.S.)
I’m going to find a better one.
AMELIA
Why can’t Daddy live here with us?
FAITH
I don’t like visiting him at the
halfway house.
MAGGIE (O.S.)
Your father is still recovering
from his breakdown.
FAITH
He’s a way better cook than you.
IN THE KITCHEN
Maggie sighs heavily.

13.
MAGGIE
Girls, let’s have a little quiet.
A few moments of quiet.
IN THE DINING ROOM
Amelia watches as Faith digs in to the table harder and with
more determination.
AMELIA
Daddy told me they injected him
with Thorazine at the hospital and
it made him bite the insides of his
cheeks until his mouth was filled
with blood.
Beat.
MAGGIE (O.S.)
It’s still quiet time.
AMELIA
What’s Thorazine?
Maggie comes out with two bowls of pasta and sees what Faith
has been doing. She drops the bowls down on the table and
grabs Faith by the shoulders.
MAGGIE
Faith! What are you doing? Why
would you do that? Why would you
do that?
FAITH
It’s a flower. It’s pretty.
Maggie sinks into a dining room chair, lays her head on the
table and sobs. After a moment, the girls take their pasta
bowls and start eating in silence.
AMELIA
Now we’re being quiet, Mommy.
FAITH
Yeah, Mommy, now we’re being quiet.
EXT. STREET. DAY
It is raining. Faith and Amelia, both wearing backpacks,
walk down an urban sidewalk. They are five feet apart, not
speaking. They come to a corner. Amelia goes straight and
Faith goes right.

14.
EXT. ALLEY. DAY
Amelia trudges alone down an alley.
EXT. DESOLATE PARK. DAY
Amelia cuts through a public park.
EXT. VINYL-SIDED HOUSE. DAY
Amelia approaches a three-story house. She rings the
doorbell. She is dripping wet. One of Cam’s HOUSEMATES
answers the door. He has an unfriendly, suspicious manner
and bad skin.
AMELIA
My father... lives here?
INT. SECOND-FLOOR HALLWAY.

DAY

Amelia passes a fidgety woman with a bowl haircut. She stops
and stares at the closed door to her father’s room. There is
a home-made poster taped to the door which reads:
You say INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY,
I say WE ARE NOT ALONE.
Also taped to the door is a National Geographic picture of a
gorilla. She knocks.
Yes?

CAM (O.S.)

She opens the door. Cam sits over the various parts of a
camera, unshaven with a cigarette in his mouth. He wears
jeans and a green sweatshirt that says “Vermont”. His room
is filled with moving boxes stacked floor to ceiling. He
stands, surprised to see his bedraggled daughter.
Darling!

CAM
Poor little draggletail.

He tosses the cigarette into a Styrofoam coffee cup and puts
it on a table with many other old half-filled cups with
cigarette butts in them. He kneels down to hug her.
CAM
I’m going to make you some soup.
He picks her up in his arms and carries her down the stairs.

15.
INT. HALFWAY HOUSE KITCHEN. DAY
Amelia’s clothes hang over the hissing radiator, drying off.
Cam stirs soup on the stove. Amelia sits at the table
wrapped in a big towel. Cam opens a tin of biscuits and
arranges them on a plate.
CAM
What’s my plan? My plan is... get
a job. That’s number one.
Amelia nods her approval.
CAM
I’ll get out of this halfway house
and get my own apartment. Then you
girls can come for sleepovers and
I’ll make crepes for breakfast and
dinner.
Amelia nods her approval.
CAM
And then I’ll move back in with you
and Faith and Mommy. That is, if
Mommy will have me.
He holds the plate of biscuits out to her.

She takes one.

AMELIA
I feel like Lucy visiting Mr.
Tumnus.
Cam smiles, pleased.
CAM
That’s the nicest thing anyone’s
ever said to me.
AMELIA
Mommy says you have a drinking
problem.
Cam bristles, offended.
CAM
Most people I know drink far more
than I do.
AMELIA
I think if you could stop drinking
and take your lithium then Mommy
would let you come home.

16.
CAM
(sighing deeply)
I don’t think Mommy loves me
anymore.
AMELIA
But she says she loves you!
Really?

CAM
Does she say it a lot?

AMELIA
She always says she loves you. But
that it’s hard to live with you
when you refuse to face up to your
adult responsibilities.
CAM
(frowns)
Do you think Mommy should be
confiding in you like this?
AMELIA
I don’t know.
CAM
The thing is I can see all this
from Mommy’s point of view. I
certainly understand why she slept
with Jake Beal after the Walden
Pond incident. Sleeping with Will
Bronson was pushing it, but I still
forgive her.
AMELIA
But Mommy says you slept with
somebody in the hall closet during
a party when I was eight months
old. She says you started it.
CAM
(defensive)
I was manic. I was high as a kite
when I did that. I never had a
prolonged affair like everybody
else seems to do!
Amelia looks down and reaches for another biscuit.
sighs, sorry and sad.
CAM
Do you still feel like Lucy
visiting Mr. Tumnus?

Cam

17.
AMELIA
Not really.
INT. MAGGIE’S DREARY OFFICE. DAY
Maggie stands at a large metal filing cabinet, organizing
color-coded files. A square-shaped woman in her 50s deposits
a tall stack of files next to Maggie’s head: CAROL.
These too.
The phone rings.

CAROL

Maggie tenses.

CAROL
Tell your kids to stop calling.
This is a job.
Carol trundles away.

Maggie answers, professionally.

MAGGIE
Hello, Keller Brothers -(quietly)
Faith, is it important, sweetie?
You can’t call so much. They don’t
like it. No TV... Okay, one show -two shows and a movie, but please
don’t call again unless you have
to. I love you.
INT. APARTMENT. EVENING
Cam makes dinner: crepes filled with creamed chicken and
spinach. Faith sets the table. Amelia plays the piano.
The front door key turns in the lock.
FAITH
Mommy’s home!
Maggie opens the door and walks in with a bag of groceries.
Faith gestures to the table with a flourish. Maggie nods,
impressed, and then she sees Cam in the kitchen and reacts,
surprised, but not unpleasantly.
INT. KITCHEN. CONTINUOUS
Maggie joins Cam in the kitchen.
Hello.

MAGGIE

18.
CAM
Hello. Guess who showed up on my
doorstep today?
He nods toward Amelia.

Maggie puts her groceries down.

MAGGIE
How did she get there?
Walked.

CAM

MAGGIE
All the way from school?
He nods.

They share a look of parental concern.

Then:

CAM
I think we should find a therapist
for her to talk to.
MAGGIE
Do you think that’s something your
parents might pay for? Mine can’t
help anymore.
CAM
I’ll ask them.
Maggie smiles at him gratefully and unpacks the groceries.
They move around the tiny kitchen. In the living room,
Amelia starts playing a jaunty version of “The Entertainer.”
CAM
She’s getting good.
(calling)
That sounds great, Big Little!
(to Maggie)
How’s the job going?
MAGGIE
Oh, the job.
She hangs her head.
MAGGIE
I graduated from Sarah Lawrence.
can’t believe I’m doing this.

I

Maggie looks sad and tired. Cam puts his arm around her and
Maggie leans into his shoulder. Amelia walks into the
kitchen and puts her arms around both parents, joining them
in this sweet moment. They smile down at her. Then Maggie
deflates.

19.
MAGGIE
I forgot the laundry -AMELIA
We’ll get it!
She pushes her parents together and runs from the room.
INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY.

MOMENTS LATER

The apartment door slams. Amelia and Faith walk down the
hall with a hamper. They look at each other hopefully.
INT. APARTMENT BUILDING STAIRS NEAR LAUNDRY ROOM. NIGHT
Amelia and Faith walk away from the laundry room with their
hamper full of clothes. Three children are playing cards on
the stairs in the hall. KIM, 10, and ALI, 8, are Korean
sisters. Also with them is THURGOOD, 12, who is black and
very tall, friendly and fey.
KIM

Hi.

AMELIA/FAITH

Hi.

KIM
I’m Kim. This is Ali. This is
Thurgood. We live on the ninth
floor.
THURGOOD
(with a floppy wave)
Hey there.
AMELIA
I’m Amelia and this is Faith.
KIM
You guys go to Lincoln?
No.

AMELIA
We go to Peabody.

Kim squints angrily.
KIM
Peabody is the best public school
in the city. We’re not in the
Peabody School district.

20.
Thurgood puts his hand to his mouth, mock afraid.
THURGOOD
(sing song)
Uh oh. Somebody’s telling a big
fat fib!
KIM
If you live here, you’re supposed
to go to Lincoln. A school that is
totally one hundred percent
terrible.
THURGOOD
Unless you like getting your ‘A’
kicked by Irish kids.
FAITH
I don’t want to get my ‘A’ kicked.
THURGOOD
Honey, nobody does.
AMELIA
Well... we go to Peabody.
As Amelia and Faith struggle up the stairs with their hamper:
KIM
You don’t get it. What you’re
doing is illegal. And it’s not
fair. It’s not at all fair. You
guys are going to go to jail.
Amelia and Faith hurry away.
Bye.

Faith looks back.

FAITH

INT. APARTMENT. NIGHT
The family sits at the table, having finished the dinner Cam
made. Music plays on the record player.

AMELIA
If you want us to go to the Peabody
School so bad, why didn’t we move
into the Peabody School district?
MAGGIE
We can’t afford the Peabody School
district. We’re lucky to have
gotten a rent-controlled apartment.
AMELIA
But Daddy’s family is so rich --

MAGGIE
(losing it)
Yes, but we have no money! Can you

CAM
Seconds, anyone?
Faith holds out her plate.

Cam serves.

MAGGIE
Thank you, Cam, for this delicious
dinner.
CAM
Could be like this every night...
Maggie stiffens.
MAGGIE
That would be nice, but I need a
husband, not a wife.
CAM
I’d like to be a husband but my
wife won’t let me.
MAGGIE
Girls, go play in the lobby.
But -Go!

MAGGIE

As they scurry out of the apartment:

INT. APARTMENT. NIGHT
Maggie lays out three Business School applications on the
dining room table: Harvard, Columbia, Wharton.
EXT. STREET. DAY
Cam is on a pay phone on Mass Ave. He is leaving an
answering machine message. He wears a green polo shirt and
madras shorts. He wears a Polaroid 250 around his neck.
CAM
Hi, Maggie. It’s me. It’s a
beautiful day. I’m skulking around
Harvard Square. Anybody home?
Pick up if you’re there.
He waits.

No answer.

He continues his message.

CAM
Just wanted to see...
INT. RESTAURANT PHONE BOOTH. DIFFERENT DAY
Cam stands at a restaurant pay phone, leaving another
message. He wears a battered corduroy sportcoat.
CAM

INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY.

DAY

Amelia sits on a bench outside the Principal’s Office,
hugging her backpack, trying not to cry. Maggie exits the
Principal’s Office and sits down next to Amelia.
AMELIA
What’d he say?
MAGGIE
(lightly)
He said we’re not in the Peabody
School district so you and Faith
have to go to Lincoln.
Amelia’s face crumples.
AMELIA
I’m sorry, Mommy.
Maggie hugs Amelia to her.
MAGGIE
Don’t apologize to me. Please
don’t apologize to me -AMELIA
He asked where we lived and I
wasn’t sure what to say -MAGGIE
You did the right thing.

I never

AMELIA
He said it was illegal what we were
doing.
MAGGIE
I guess I wasn’t thinking of it
that way. I just wanted you to go
to the best school.
Maggie sits back and wipes at Amelia’s tears.

What if Faith gets beat up and it’s
all because of me?
MAGGIE
Don’t worry about Faith.

Faith

Amelia laughs, then:
AMELIA
I love my teacher.
MAGGIE
And she loves you. She stopped me
in the hall and told me...
(her voice breaks)
She was so sorry. And she would
miss you very much.
Amelia nods and leans against her mother.
INT. LIVING ROOM. DAY
Cam enters with two pillowcases stuffed with clothes. Two
sleeping bags sit on the sofa. As Cam picks up a teddy bear
and stuffs it in one of the pillowcases:
CAM
Sleeping bags, pajamas, stuffed
animals, books, changes of clothes,
what am I forgetting?
MAGGIE (O.S.)
Toothbrushes?
Maggie enters from the kitchen with a tray. On it is a
teapot and tea cups and buttered toast on a plate. She puts
it on the table and pours it out, handing him a cup.
CAM
I bought toothbrushes they can keep
at my apartment. And I took two
big cardboard boxes and set them up
like little beds. They’re going to
flip.
MAGGIE
They’re so excited.

26.
CAM
And during the day they can turn
them over and use them as puppet
theaters.
MAGGIE
You’re going to have fun.
CAM
Now that I have my own place,
Maggie, I’d be happy to pick them
up any day and have them stay over.
There’s room for you too...
Beat.

Maggie doesn’t reciprocate.
CAM
Just kidding. Not until you’re
ready.
MAGGIE
Cam, I got into business school.

Cam reacts, impressed.
CAM
Maggie Stuart, you are some
punkins. I wish I had some of that
bourgeois midwestern can-do.
MAGGIE
I got a scholarship.

To Columbia.

Cam is thrown.
CAM
Wait. You can’t take the girls to
New York.
MAGGIE
No. I can’t even afford a studio
apartment in New York. Jenny said
her mother has a small room she can
rent me.
CAM
So what about the girls?
MAGGIE
Here’s my proposal. I can get my
degree in eighteen months if I do
the summer session. So I go to New
York. You move in here and take
care of the girls.

27.
He looks at her for a long beat.
...Me?

Then:

CAM

He takes out a cigarette.
MAGGIE
Yes. You. You miss them. And
they miss you so much. It’s just
eighteen months. When I get my
MBA, I’ll get a job in Boston and
move back in here.
(gripping his arm)
I know it sounds crazy, Cam, but
you can do it. I know you can.
Cam walks away from her, considering.
CAM
I suppose it might be good for me
to have a purpose -MAGGIE
A routine. The doctor thinks
that’s exactly what you need.
CAM
Yes. A routine. Getting meals on
the table. Taking them to school
every morning, putting them to bed
every night, making sure they brush
their hair and their teeth... the
laundry.
He looks exhausted.
CAM
That sounds like a lot.
MAGGIE
It is a lot. But we’re sinking
deeper and deeper into a hole and I
have to do something.
CAM
The new school does feel a bit like
a reformatory.
MAGGIE
It’s grim. You and I went to good
schools, we had piano lessons --

28.
CAM
I never had any lessons.
MAGGIE
But you learned how to fence and
ski and sail and speak French...
CAM
But I never took lessons. My
family taught me those things.
MAGGIE
The point is we both got a good
education. And I want that for our
children.
CAM
Well, I want that too. But
eighteen months is a lot of
routine.
MAGGIE
You can do it.
I can?

CAM

MAGGIE
I will come back every weekend and
help you.
Cam looks at her.
CAM
Every weekend?

Yes.

And stay here with

MAGGIE

CAM
So it would be like we were a
family again?
She nods. Cam looks off into the distance, a determined look
on his face. He feels the importance of his mission.
CAM
I am their father, after all.

29.
INT. RESTAURANT. DAY
Maggie sits across from MURRAY and PAULINE STUART, Cam’s
parents. Murray wears a corduroy jacket with a pipe tucked
into the pocket. Pauline wears a red turtleneck with a
large, elaborate jade necklace over it.
PAULINE
I’m afraid we need to intervene on
our son’s behalf and say: no. He’s
just not up to the task.
MAGGIE
I know he can do it.
MURRAY
And what if he can’t?

It’s a

Reveal that Cam is also at the table. He takes umbrage at
his father’s remark as he lights his mother’s cigarette.
CAM
You don’t seem to think I can do
anything.
PAULINE
We just don’t want you to tax
yourself, darling boy.
MAGGIE
We met with Dr. Wendell. He said
Cam has made an excellent recovery
from his breakdown and he felt he
could do this.
CAM
He thinks I need more
responsibility, not less.
Murray looks mystified.
MURRAY
But you’re a man. Even if you
could do it, why would you want to?
MAGGIE
He loves to cook. He loves to tell
stories and play games. He’s a
good father. I would never ask him
if I didn’t believe he could do it.
Cam smiles at her gratefully.

He puts his hand on hers.

30.
PAULINE
We believe in him too, but what if
he has a breakdown?
MAGGIE
He won’t. Because we’re all going
to support him and make sure he
takes his lithium. I’ll check in
every day on the phone and I’ll be
there on the weekends.
PAULINE
That sounds exhausting.
MURRAY
Is this because of Feminism?
MAGGIE
We’re living at the poverty level.
The girls are at a terrible school.
MURRAY
Our children went to the best
schools and I’ll tell you, it
didn’t add up to much.
PAULINE
(turning on him)
Our children are delightful!
MURRAY
Absolutely. But not one of them is
self-supporting.
PAULINE
Well, Murray, lest you forget:
neither are we.
Annoyed, Murray pulls the pipe out of his pocket and starts
to pack it.
CAM
I think what Maggie is doing is
quite admirable.
I agree.

MURRAY
Very commendable.

PAULINE
But how did it get to this? I
thought Gaga was paying the rent on
your little apartment.

31.

She is.

MAGGIE

PAULINE
It isn’t enough?
No.

MAGGIE

PAULINE
(to Murray)
Don’t we have some crystal or some
silver we could sell?
MURRAY
That won’t even pay for this meal.
PAULINE
(forcefully)
No no no. Maggie Stuart, you
cannot leave your family.
MAGGIE
Pauline, I’m desperate. Utterly
and completely desperate. We have
no money.
Pauline looks like she just ate something terrible.
PAULINE
I hate talking about “money!”
Pauline always says the word “money” with extreme distaste.
MURRAY
Then let’s drop it.
PAULINE
(leaning in)
I wish we could help but we’re
barely getting by on the dollops of
cash Gaga doles out to us...
MURRAY
Pauline, please!
Murray turns his back on the table and aggressively puffs on
his pipe. This is uncomfortable for him.
MAGGIE
Cam is a trust fund baby with no
trust fund. My parents have done
all they can. One of us is going
to have to earn a living.

She pats Maggie’s hand with genuine

Oh, my dear, it all just sounds so
dreary!
EXT. PARKING LOT. DAY
Cam, wearing jade swimming trunks and a bright green shirt,
is organizing Maggie’s suitcases in the back of a small UHaul. A nervous, skinny man in his 40s looks on, biting his
fingernails. He is PETER.

Why does he keep re-arranging
everything? It was fine before.
We need to go, Maggie. We’re

Maggie nods. Peter gets into the passenger seat.

CAM

You’re saying goodbye to your

Maggie laughs.

He wraps her up in a big hug.

They shake their heads.
CAM
We could go to the Museum of Fine

Why is his portrait hanging at the

Because a very important artist
named John Singer Sargent painted
it.
Why?

“Why?” Don’t you know who we are?

EXT. BEACON HILL. DAY
Cam and the girls are in his Fiat. The car is filled with
trash: food wrappers, used napkins, empty containers, orange
peels, mail. They are parked outside a large freestanding
mansion on Beacon Hill.
CAM
That’s where your great-grandmother
grew up.
FAITH
In that whole house?
CAM
The whole thing. It’s the grandest
house on Beacon Hill. Designed by
Bulfinch, a very famous architect.
AMELIA
How did they get so rich?
CAM
Railroads. Your great-greatgrandfather was once the richest
man in Boston.
AMELIA
So how come we’re so poor?
CAM
...Well, all that money was put
into a trust which is controlled by
your great-grandmother. And she
decides when to give who what.
And... it’s hard to explain.
The girls stare at the house in awe.
CAM
You want to see the inside?
They look excited and confused.
FAITH
Are we allowed?
AMELIA
You can’t just walk up and knock on
people’s doors.

CAM

Sweetheart... this is Boston.
They’re practically expecting us.
INT. ENTRY HALL. DAY
The girls look around the grand entry hall, amazed. Cam has
a hand on each of their shoulders. A MAID comes in.
MAID
Mr. Fabrini will be out in a
minute.
CAM
(to girls)
On the second floor are the parlors
where they would have huge fancy
dress balls...they would lay thick
canvas down to protect the wooden
floors and it looked like snow...
A man in his mid-40s comes out of a study. This is MR.
FABRINI. He wears a business suit. He seems annoyed.
MR. FABRINI
Can I help you?
CAM
Hello. My name is Cam Stuart. My
great-grandmother grew up in this
house and I was wondering if I
could show it to my daughters.
It’s an important part of their
family history.
MR. FABRINI
I’m sorry, Mr. Stuart. But this is
my home. I don’t give tours.
The girls are mortified.
Cam holds them in place.

They both start for the door, but
He is defiant.

CAM
This house was in my family for
more than five generations. My
great-great grandfather was born in
this house on Boxing Day in 1842.
MR. FABRINI
And would your great-greatgrandfather give tours to anyone
who came along?

38.
CAM
Certainly. If they had a personal
connection going back more than
five generations.
MR. FABRINI
Then he’s a better man than me.
CAM
(pointed)
“Better man than I.”
The girls wince.
INT. FIAT. MOMENTS LATER
Cam drives much too fast down Storrow Drive, weaving in and
out of traffic. Everyone is shouting.
CAM
We’re going back there again! I’m
going back every day till he shows
you that house!
Slow down!

AMELIA

CAM
Our family lived there for more
than a century for chrissake!

But it’s his house now and he
doesn’t want to show it to you!

That was so embarrassing!

You shouldn’t be embarrassed!

No!

INT. APARTMENT. NIGHT
The apartment is filled with boxes. Amelia is on the kitchen

both unhappy, talking low, as Cam lurks about.

I’ll be home in twelve days...

We want you to come home right now.

every single weekend. That’s what
you said.
INT. MAGGIE’S NEW YORK ROOM. SAME TIME
Maggie stands in a grim little room with a bed and a desk and
a bright overhead light. Her suitcases surround her. You
can hear loud traffic noise.
MAGGIE

INT. LIVING ROOM. MORNING
Cam is snoring on the couch still wearing the bright green
shirt and jade swimming trunks. The TV is on. Faith stands

Cam opens his eyes and blinks at her, disoriented.

A disheveled Cam races down the hall and puts his hand on the
door of the elevator to keep it from closing. In his other
hand he has a box of cereal.
Girls!

On the elevator is an attractive woman professionally
dressed. This is BECCA. She wears a turtleneck sweater and
big brown glasses. She smiles at Cam. He smiles back.

Cam has the hood of his car open. The girls walk up, wearing
their backpacks, not talking to each other.
CAM
You girls want to learn how to
change an oil filter? It’s pretty
straightforward -AMELIA/FAITH
No./Not really.
CAM
Just don’t be helpless.
He shuts the hood. A woman in her mid-50s is taking many
grocery bags out of her car. This is RUTH-ANN MCKAY.

INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY. NIGHT
Cam carries three bags and the girls each struggle to carry
one down the hall to Ruth-Ann’s apartment. She unlocks her
door and starts taking the bags from them.
CAM
Do you need us to help you put them

RUTH-ANN
No, this is fine. Just put the

The girls’ interest is piqued.
INT. GIRLS’ BEDROOM. NIGHT
Cam sits in the reading chair. The girls are in their beds,
listening intently to their father’s story. Faith has
curlers in her hair and a net over them.
CAM
I was on my way to my Ec 10 exam
and I hear this bag-pipe music so I
follow the sound into The Square
and a street musician is playing
Scottish ballads and he’s got his
hat out. People are walking by and
putting money in it and I think
that’s a good idea. So I put my
hat out and sit next to him and I
start singing along in my best
Scottish brogue and he tells me to
scram.
AMELIA
Because he didn’t ask you to sing
and he wants to make all the money.
CAM
Exactly. Well, we exchanged a few
words and then...the bastard jumped
me! This scrawny little guy and he
jumped me! We got into a major
brawl on top of the bag pipes and I
got so excited I shit my pants.
Ew!

AMELIA/FAITH

Cam laughs.
CAM
Needless to say, I didn’t make the
exam.

46.
AMELIA
And they kicked you out for missing
one exam?
CAM
Well... then the next semester I
registered for seventy-five
courses.
He chuckles.
CAM
That’s when they determined I might
not be Harvard material.
CUT TO:
Both girls are asleep, breathing steadily. The clock ticks.
Cam gets up from his chair and turns out the light.
INT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT
Cam walks into the living room of the apartment, which is now
full of all his boxes. He stares at them.
Cam opens a box. It is filled with magazines, pieces of
paper, phone books, tools, cords. It is completely
disorganized.
He blinks at it. It fills him with despair.
INT. KITCHEN. NIGHT
Dirty dishes are piled in the sink and all over the counters.
Cam stares at it in despair.
INT. HALLWAY. DAY
The laundry hamper is overflowing, dirty clothes piled
halfway up the wall. Cam stares at it in despair.
INT. FRONT DOOR. NIGHT
Cam grabs his coat and scarf from the coat-stand.

I’ll be back before midnight...
No answer from the sleeping girls.

He opens the door, closes it quietly behind him.
EXT. PARKING LOT. NIGHT
Cam steps out into the cool air. He takes a deep breath,
lights a cigarette, and heads out into the night.
INT. DIVE BAR. NIGHT
A bar full of aging professors, shaggy poets and intense
poetesses.
Cam sits at the bar, drinking a can of beer. He has an
animated conversation with two friends. One wears a bow-tie,
horn-rimmed glasses and a tweed jacket; the other wears a
grimy coat and ragged hat. The homeless-looking friend
laughs, revealing no front teeth. Cam gestures to the
bartender, indicating another round.
INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY. NIGHT
Cam, drunk and smoking, walks down the long hall to the
corner apartment. He takes out his keys and opens the door.
But it stops; the chain-lock has been fastened.
All the lights in the apartment are on.

Oh, shit.

Cam cannot handle the onslaught of attitude.

Fuck it, forget it.

Have a nice

Cam puts the Fiat in gear and zooms off, way too fast. The
girls watch him go, stunned and self-conscious, knowing that
the other kids heard.
INT. APARTMENT. DAY
Cam looks at all the boxes. The place is a disaster. He
goes to the window and looks out. It is a beautiful day.
Cam sighs.
CUT TO:
THE RECORD PLAYER
Cam drops the needle on Olatunje’s Drums of Passion. A heavy
rhythmic beat fills the room as he opens up the first box and
pulls out a rusted old machete.
INT. APARTMENT. LATER
The girls enter the apartment. They can’t believe their
eyes. It is spic and span. A large new bookshelf lines the
front hall. They jump up and down like crazy.
Daddy!

FAITH/AMELIA
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

Cam enters from his bedroom. He wears a grimy, oil-stained
jumpsuit. The girls throw themselves into his arms.
CAM
Pretty good, right?
FAITH
It’s beautiful. We love it!
CAM
Just don’t look in my bedroom.
The girls hurry to his bedroom.

51.
INT. CAM’S BEDROOM. MOMENTS LATER
Cam’s room looks like a garage. Large industrial metal
shelves house paint-thinner, spray paint cans, motor oil,
etc. Stacks of mail and magazines cover the desk and there
are clothes all over the bed. Amelia points at the bed.
AMELIA
Is that a machete?
FAITH
We’ll keep this door closed...
She closes the door.
INT. APARTMENT. NIGHT
Spirits are high. Amelia clears the dining room table.
Faith washes the dishes and Cam dries and puts the dishes
away. They sing a World War II marching song.
ALL THREE
Hitler! Has only got one
ball...Goering! Has two but very
small...Himmler! Has something
sim’lar...But Josef Goebels has no
balls at all...
EXT. TRAIN STATION. NIGHT
Cam and the girls stand on the platform as the train pulls in
to the Station. Cam is trying to untangle some of the
massive snarls in Amelia’s hair. Maggie gets off at the far
end. The girls take off, running for her.
Maggie drops her suitcase and drops to her knees and holds
them tight. Cam walks toward them, smiling. He holds a
bunch of orange gerberas. She accepts them and kisses him on
the cheek. She kisses both girls on the head.
He picks up her suitcase and they walk down the platform.
The girls skip alongside, holding their mother’s hand, happy
to be all together.
INT. APARTMENT. DAY
The family bustles into the apartment. Maggie stops dead
when she sees how cozy and warm it is. She looks at them
with amazement. The girls are gleeful.

52.
MAGGIE
Who built these shelves?
Daddy.

AMELIA

Cam looks modest but he is bursting with pride.
CAM
They’re just shelves.
EXT. PARK. DAY
Faith and Amelia play on the monkey bars.
on a bench. Maggie looks happy.

Cam and Maggie sit

MAGGIE
It was hard to come this weekend.
I’m so glad I did. I think this is
just what you needed, Cam! I think
this is going to be a great thing
for us.
He smiles at her and takes her hand. She smiles back at him.
They sit holding hands as they watch the girls play.
CUT TO:
UNDOING THE APARTMENT MONTAGE
Cam lays out a bunch of newspaper on the living room floor
and goes to work, taking apart an old phone. He walks away
from the tools and parts of the disassembled phone and it
never moves.
CUT TO:
The girls come in with a large hamper of laundry. They dump
it on the sofa and start folding it, but then they run off
and it stays where it is.
CUT TO:
The family sits in the living room eating dinner in front of
the television. A large roll of paper towels that is sitting
on the coffee table is knocked over and rolls to the floor,
leaving a long trail of paper towel. Nobody picks it up.
CUT TO:

53.
Cam lies on the sofa, drinking a beer and watching
television. His head rests on the pile of clean laundry.
Amelia and Faith roller skate around the room.
CUT TO:
The phone parts have been pushed under the piano bench to
make room for Cam’s bicycle, which stands upside down as he
fixes the brake mechanism. He puts his glass down on top of
the piano, in front of a large model ship. The top of the
piano is now filled with dirty glasses, beer cans and empty
yogurt containers with spoons sticking out of them.

Cam sits down in his armchair and starts taping wide silver
duct tape over a large tear in the arm.

Ow!

He is trying to

AMELIA
Daddy!

Sorry.
OW!

CAM
AMELIA

CAM
This is what happens when you don’t
brush your hair for two weeks.
Faith marches out of the kitchen, furious.
FAITH
Daddy, if you’re not going to do
the dishes, then I’m doing them.
Cam blinks at her.

It is an odd threat.

He shrugs.

54.
CAM

Okay.

Faith marches into the kitchen. A cupboard opens and slams
shut. He turns his attention back to Amelia’s hair.
AMELIA
You’re hurting me!

I’ll do it!

She turns and rips the brush from his hand.
Fine.

CAM
You do it.

Amelia stomps away to the bedroom. Seconds later Faith
marches back to the living room with a sponge held between
two fingers.
FAITH
Where are the sponges?
Cam becomes immediately stern.
CAM
What’s wrong with that sponge?
It smells!

FAITH

CAM
Then don’t smell it!
FAITH
My hands stink just from touching
it!
CAM
That’s because someone left it
soaking in the dishwater! I keep
telling you girls, it needs to be
rinsed and squeezed when you’re
through with it!
FAITH
You brought it from your old
apartment! It’s probably five
years old! It’s disgusting!
CAM
We are not the kind of people who
throw perfectly useful things away!
FAITH
You won’t throw anything away!

55.
CAM
That is a perfectly good sponge
with plenty of life left in it!
Faith throws the sponge at him.
Fine!

FAITH
Then you do the dishes!

Fine!

CAM
I will!

With this sponge!

Faith runs away. The downstairs neighbor pounds on the
ceiling. Cam angrily pounds back.
INT. APARTMENT. NIGHT
Maggie, wearing her coat and holding her suitcase, stares
with dismay at the wreckage of the apartment.
CAM
We lost some momentum, but we’ll
get it back.
(beat)
I did get a new sponge.
(pointed, to the girls)
Even though I washed the old one
with soap and it smelled fine.
INT. APARTMENT. DAY
Maggie, wearing yellow rubber gloves and her hair tied back,
cleans furiously. Cam and the girls make piles.

Amelia helps her mother make her bed on the sofa.
practices her pirouettes.
AMELIA
Faith and I thought of the perfect
job for Daddy. A crepe cart in
Harvard Square. Like they have in
Paris.
Maggie and Cam look at each other, amused.
MAGGIE
You do make the best crepes.

Faith

56.
CAM
And I do love standing outside in
January, freezing my ass off for
pennies.
Maggie laughs.
FAITH
We’re working on the menu.
MAGGIE
I like chocolate and coconut.
FAITH
We have that!
She does a dramatic pirouette.

Her parents laugh.

INT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT
It is late. Maggie sits up in her bed on the sofa, sewing a
button on a little girl’s sweater. Cam sits at the other end
of the sofa. The girls have gone to bed. Cam is feeling
sorry for himself.
CAM
...and the building is packed with
single mothers who are always
checking in with each other and
getting together for coffee but do
any of them ever ask how I’m doing?
Do they ever invite me for coffee?
I’m pretty sure they all got
together for wine and cheese two
nights ago.
Maggie has to bite her lip to keep from laughing.
MAGGIE
I’m sorry, it’s not funny.
CAM
(smiling)
It is funny. It’s pathetic. I’m a
pathetic whiner. Which is probably
why they don’t invite me.
MAGGIE
They’re leery of men, that’s all.
Especially married men with
children.

57.
CAM
I’m not exactly a married man.
(beat)
Am I?
Well.

MAGGIE
We’re a family.

Cam slides his hand up her leg.

She shifts away.

CAM
So is this really how we’re going
to do it? You come every weekend
and take up residence on the sofa?
For now.

MAGGIE

CAM
Come on, Maggie. We haven’t slept
together since before my breakdown-He leans forward and kisses her, but after a moment she rolls
off the sofa and moves away from him. He chases after her,
playful, flirting.
MAGGIE
I don’t know what will happen, Cam.
I just want to get through this
period. Can’t we see how it goes?
As he attempts to unbutton her top:
CAM
And what happens at the end? You
move back in here and what happens
to us? Where do I go?
MAGGIE
I want you to be the person we all
know you can be. It will take
steady, sustained effort. You can
do it, Cam. If you want to do it.
He puts his hand on her breast.
CAM
Sexy, sexy answer.
She laughs at his unrelenting flirtation.
MAGGIE
Honest, honest answer.

CAM
So what is this?

Some big test?

MAGGIE
Don’t think of it like that.

Not if this was on the test...
He kisses her.

This time she kisses him back.

APARTMENT HALLWAY.

NIGHT

The girls stand outside the closed door to Cam’s bedroom,
listening and whispering to each other.
FAITH
Are they having sex?
AMELIA
I think maybe.
The girls celebrate silently.

Then they hear raised voices:

MAGGIE (O.S.)
I’m sorry, Cam. I just can’t make
promises right now -CAM (O.S.)
What a bunch of baloney. You must
think I’m the biggest sucker on the
planet.
The girls scurry into their room as Cam’s bedroom door is
ripped open. Cam walks out, pulling his shirt on. He grabs
his coat. Maggie runs after him.
MAGGIE
Are you taking your lithium?
CAM
Oh, shit. Lithium doesn’t stop you
from feeling lonely and
unappreciated. Enjoy your sofa.
He exits.

The front door slams.

59.
INT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT
Maggie lies on her bed on the sofa. Amelia walks up to her.
Maggie lifts the covers and Amelia gets under the blankets
next to her mother.
AMELIA
When you and Daddy met at WGBH, was
he the way he is now?
MAGGIE
(delicately)
In some ways. He was funny.
Compassionate. He knew everything
about the outdoors. He had a job,
which was good for him. He was a
terrific lighting designer. But in
the end, it was too much
pressure... I didn’t understand
about the manic-depression.
Besides, everyone was having
nervous breakdowns in the 60s, so I
didn’t realize what a big deal it
was.
AMELIA
You’re probably sorry you married
him.
No.

MAGGIE
Never.

Amelia snuggles in closer.
AMELIA
You know, he’s not usually so angry
like he just was. We yell at him
way more than he yells at us.
This information is not comforting to Maggie.
EXT. STREET. DAY
A cold winter day in a run-down part of Somerville,
Massachusetts.
Cam leans over the engine of a dented and rusty Plymouth
Valiant, gunmetal gray with white patches. He wears a grimy
green parka with a gray three-piece suit poking out
underneath. He wears nice leather shoes. A cigarette hangs
out of his mouth. His hair is combed.
He shuts the hood.

60.
Amelia and Faith watch apprehensively. Amelia wears a parka
over white tights. Her snarly hair is pulled back in two
barrettes. Faith wears a long wool coat and has her hair
neatly combed under a velvet headband.
Cam crosses to the driver’s side, gets in and turns the car
on, revs the engine. CHRIS, the unfriendly man selling the
car, doesn’t even try to give a spiel.
CHRIS
Like I said in the ad, it runs.
Cam looks around the interior of the car.
CHRIS
There’s been some wear and tear on
the seats.
A large flap of vinyl hangs down revealing the foam
underneath. In the front and the back.
CAM
Get in, girls, see what you think.
Chris opens the back door and the unhappy girls start to
climb in.
AMELIA
There’s no floor!
CHRIS
It’s a little rusted.
on it.

Don’t step

Amelia and Faith look at each other, sinking. They slide
onto the backseat without stepping on the floor.
Cam leans through the back door and looks at the floor well,
which is a rusty hole with ragged rusted edges.
CAM
No floor? That’s dangerous. I
have two small children. I’ll give
you three hundred and you deal with
the Fiat.
He points to the Fiat which now has a broken driver side
window that’s been taped up with plastic and duct tape.
INT. VALIANT. DAY
As the Valiant pulls away, Amelia kneels on the backseat and
waves out the back window.

61.
AMELIA
Goodbye, Fiat! Goodbye, Fiat!
Cam honks the horn in rapid succession for a cheerful,
triumphant goodbye. They drive out into the street. Faith
sits down and opens a “Harper’s Bazaar” but Amelia stays
kneeling on the seat, looking out the back window. Her eyes
fill with tears.
FAITH
Daddy, Amelia’s crying.
AMELIA
You always cry.
Faith looks out the window, an angry expression on her face.
FAITH
Not anymore. I vowed never to cry
again.
Cam looks in the rear-view mirror with concern.
CAM
My little Stoic? What’s wrong,
darling? Ma petite pamplemousse?
The tears roll down Amelia’s face and she can’t wipe them
away fast enough.
AMELIA
It’s just... What’s going to happen
to the Fiat? Nobody’s going to
want it.
FAITH
I thought you were crying because
this car sucks.
Amelia shakes her head and says in a small voice:
AMELIA
That car sucked too.
She watches as the Fiat gets smaller and smaller and then
they turn a corner and it’s gone.
INT. VALIANT. DAY
The girls lie across the backseat, leaning against either
door, huddled beneath an old army blanket. They wear hats.

62.
Faith has the “Harper’s Bazaar” magazine on her chest and
Amelia holds a book called “Turning Your Dream Into A Small
Business”.
They are both mesmerized at the sight of the highway rushing
by through the rusty holes in the floor.
EXT. WESTON ESTATE. DAY
The Valiant turns onto a long driveway and drives past an
enormous lawn and a large weeping willow and an unattached
four car garage and parks in the circle in front of the
house, behind a maroon Bentley.
INT. DINING ROOM. DAY
A regal old lady sits at the head of a long mahogany table, a
little silver bell by her water glass. She is 92 and of
another era, extremely patrician. She wears a long-sleeved
black dress, pearls and a blonde wig that looks like hair
swirled into a bun. This is GAGA. Cam is at the foot and
the girls are in the middle. The table could sit twelve.
A BUTLER brings around a silver bowl of mashed potatoes.
Faith spoons a huge amount onto her plate next to the roast
beef and the peas. The butler continues around the table.
GAGA
I propose a game of crazy eights
after lunch.
Yeah!

FAITH

GAGA
We don’t say ‘yeah,’ dear.
‘yes.’

We say

CAM
Thank you, Gaga. Their mother
keeps fighting that battle.
GAGA
And how is their mother?
CAM
She’s well. She’s been home every
weekend. But she has finals so she
stayed in New York to study. We’re
muddling through without her.

CAM (cont'd)
Tell Betty the roast beef is
divine.
The butler nods silently and disappears to the kitchen.
GAGA
Do you girls think it’s unusual
that your mother is in New York?
AMELIA
She wants to have more career
opportunities.
FAITH
Mommy says women can do anything.
GAGA
She’s quite a “striver,” isn’t she?
That hangs in the air for the moment.
CAM
We prefer the word “fighter.”
FAITH
(pointing)
Is that a painting of Grandma
Paulie when she was little?
GAGA
Yes. And it’s pronounced
(very patrician)
‘Paulie.’
Polly.
Paulie.

Faith is fiercely concentrating. She says with extreme selfconsciousness in a faux British accent:

INT. LIVING ROOM. LATER
The girls sit at a game table playing cards with Gaga. Cam
enters, wearing his parka, carrying two large ancient cookie
sheets under his arm and a large roll of duct tape.
CAM
I’m going out to work on the car.
As Gaga shuffles the cards:
GAGA
The girls tell me it has no floor.
CAM
It had no floor.
(holding up cookie sheets)
I found these in your kitchen
vault. Betty said I could have
them.
FAITH
Cookie sheets?
CAM
You won’t be able to step on them,
but it’ll keep out the cold air and
detritus.

65.
Amelia sighs and shakes her head.
GAGA
Cam, I’m very proud of you for
taking care of these darling girls
all by yourself. I mostly use the
Lincoln these days. I’d like you
to have the Bentley.
The girls scream and leap to their feet like Lottery winners.
INT. BENTLEY. MOMENTS LATER
Amelia and Faith are scrambling all over it, touching
everything. They push every button. They run their hands
over the smooth wood. They rest their cheeks against the
leather and inhale. Amelia sits in the driver’s seat and
waves through the windshield at her father, who is outside,
looking at the car with apprehension, smoking a cigarette.
INT. LIVING ROOM. MOMENTS LATER
Gaga looks extremely displeased, both hands on her cane.
stands across from her, hands in his pockets.

Cam

CAM
We live in a rent-controlled
apartment.
GAGA
I know that. I pay your rent.
CAM
And we’re very grateful -Piffle.

GAGA
It’s dirt-cheap.

CAM
The point is... I can’t afford to
take care of the Bentley. I can’t
even afford to fill up its gas
tank.
GAGA
If you’re asking me for gas money -CAM
I’m not asking for gas money, Gaga.
Cam suddenly becomes nervous, uneasy.

This is hard for him.

66.
CAM
The girls are both phenomenal
students... they’re not being
challenged. If you really want to
help, I think they would flourish
in private school.
Beat.

She scowls at him.
GAGA
I don’t think that’s teaching the
girls a very good lesson, do you?

Cam looks confused, then resigned:
CAM
I suppose not.
Gaga takes his hand in an attempt to be supportive:
GAGA
We all believe in you, Cameron. We
know it’s not too late for you to
amount to something.
INT. VALIANT. NIGHT
They drive home in silence.

The girls pout in the back seat.

CAM
Girls, look. I’m sorry we can’t
take the Bentley. It just doesn’t
make sense. I know it’s
disappointing.
They don’t respond.

Then, in a coldly rational voice:

AMELIA
You should’ve taken it and then
sold it and bought the crepe cart
and then you could’ve made lots of
money and we wouldn’t be so poor.
CAM
Sweetie, although crepes may be
delicious, they’re not exactly the
goldmine you think they are.
Especially during a recession.
AMELIA
Well, then we could’ve sold the
Bentley and just had some money.

Gaga would never let me sell that
car.
AMELIA
But she was giving it to you.
CAM
That’s not how it works.

It’s hard

Beat.
FAITH
It was our one chance to have
something that other people might
want. Nobody wants what we have.
They ride on in silence.
EXT. TRAIN STATION. DAY
Maggie walks out of the station, with Cam and the girls. Cam
carries her suitcase. The girls brim over with excitement.
AMELIA
We have a surprise for you.
They can’t contain themselves. They run to the Valiant.
Maggie slows as she approaches the car. Inside, a DOG is
barking like mad and scrambling back and forth over the
seats. Cam whistles and when the dog sees him, he starts
whining and wagging his tail, scratching at the windows.
FAITH
That’s Jock! That’s our dog!
AMELIA
Daddy got him for us!
FAITH
Amelia named him!
MAGGIE
Why is he acting like that?
AMELIA
He was abused by his last owner.
So any time Daddy leaves him he
gets really upset.

68.
FAITH
Because he loves Daddy!
Daddy saved him!

Because

As Cam puts the suitcase in the trunk:
CAM
We’re working on it.
Maggie looks unenthusiastic.
MAGGIE
And this is the new car?
CAM
It was abused by its last owner.
But Daddy saved it!
Cam opens the passenger side door for her, with a flourish.
Jock streaks out and tears down the sidewalk, going after
another dog who is on a leash. Cam and the girls race after
him.
Jock!

No!

CAM
Bad dog!

Jock!

It is chaos.
EXT. RAYMOND PARK. DAY
Bundled up, the family kicks a soccer ball around. Jock runs
between them. Some distance away Kim and Ali watch from the
swings. Cam sees them.
CAM
Don’t those little girls live in
our building?
Yes.

AMELIA
But they’re really mean.

CAM
(amused)
Mean? They’re wearing identical
pink parkas. How mean can they be?
(calling)
Hey! Hey!
He waves at them to come over.

Hesitant, they do.

69.
EXT. RAYMOND PARK. LATER
Maggie sits on a bench with Faith in her lap. Cam plays a
spirited soccer game with all the little kids in the park.
The ball comes toward Cam, who is smoking. He throws down
his cigarette and dodges a kid, then passes the ball to Kim,
then picks up his cigarette again when the ball is gone.
INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY. NIGHT
The girls both hold onto Jock’s leash as they walk toward the
apartment. Cam and Maggie follow behind.
CAM
They seem like nice kids. You
should have them over sometime.
Both girls scowl at him over their shoulders.
No way.

AMELIA

FAITH
I’d rather die than have people
over to our shithole.
The girls take off running down the hall. Cam looks
exhausted. Maggie looks at him; he shrugs, beleaguered.
CAM
They crush my soul.
EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING. DAY
Spring.

The early crocuses are coming up.

INT. APARTMENT. NIGHT
The apartment is a disaster. Art materials lie all over the
table. Amelia bangs out a song on the piano and sings at the
top of her lungs while Faith does a dramatic dance. They are
both in their nightgowns.

Cam turns off the stove.

Grabs his overcoat and scarf.

Amelia jumps up from the piano and gets in his way.

Cam steams down the hall. Punches the elevator button.
Waiting at the elevator, he pulls a pack of cigarettes from

INT. HALLWAY. NIGHT
Cam walks back down the hall to the apartment. He unlocks
the door, but the chain is up. It stops him. He sighs with
frustration, then hurls his shoulder into the door, busting
the chain and sending the door smashing open.
The girls scream, alarmed, and jump to their feet. Amelia
holds a baseball bat, Faith holds a cricket bat. Then they
see it’s him.
INT. APARTMENT. CONTINUOUS
Cam walks in.

As he lights a cigarette:

73.
CAM
(worn-down)
You see, girls? That chain is
worthless. The only thing it
provides is a false sense of
security, and that’s the last thing
you girls need.
He hugs them and they hug him back.
AMELIA
We’ll be braver, Daddy, I promise.
Next time we’ll be braver.
He nods and heads back toward the kitchen.
CUT TO:
Cam cleans up the bowl and its contents that are spilled all
over the wall and floor.
CUT TO:
Cam replaces the chain on the door with a deadbolt lock.
INT. APARTMENT. NIGHT
Cam lies on the sofa, watching TV, drinking a beer, smoking.
He flips through the channels. He finishes the beer and
crumples it. It joins four other crumpled cans. He reaches
for another. He looks depressed.
INT. VALIANT. DAY
Cam, rumpled and low-energy, sits behind the wheel. The
girls sit in the back seat. As Maggie gets in the car, she
sees that Cam has a huge bandage that covers his entire hand
and forearm. It looks like a giant q-tip.
MAGGIE
Cam, what happened?
CAM
What? Oh. Broke up a dog fight.
Stupid.

We had to give Jock away.

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING. DAY
The swimming pool is being filled. All the kids in the
building stand outside the chain link fence watching with
excitement.
INT. VALIANT. DAY
Cam, still low-energy, waits in the car. Maggie opens the
door. The bandages on his hand are gone.
MAGGIE
The girls didn’t want to come?
CAM
It got old.
INT. APARTMENT. DAY
Maggie carries her suitcase over to the sofa in the living
room. She surveys the messy room, which now has a minitrampoline in the middle of the rug. She stares at the minitrampoline, incredulous. Faith runs in.
FAITH
Look what we found in the trash!
Faith happily starts jumping up and down on it, doing splits
in the air.
INT. KITCHEN. DAY
Cam stands at the open fridge, staring into it, uninspired.
Amelia and Faith, wearing bathing suits, charge into the
kitchen full of energy. Amelia grabs bread, peanut butter,
jam and milk. Faith hops up on the counter and pulls down
two glasses, two plates. Amelia slaps together two
sandwiches and Faith pours two glasses of milk. The girls
leave the kitchen, each gingerly carrying a plate and a very
full glass of milk. Cam still stares into the fridge.
EXT. TRAIN STATION. DAY
Cam waits in the car double-parked. He is driving a red
Toyota station wagon with one gray door. Maggie is confused
as she gets into the car.
MAGGIE
What happened to the Valiant?

Didn’t I tell you?

It caught on

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING. DAY
The swimming pool is being drained. Amelia, Faith, Kim, Ali
and Thurgood stand outside the chain link fence with their
bicycles, watching sadly as a tarp is pulled over it. After
a few moments, they hop on their bikes and pedal away.
EXT. STREET. DAY
September. Amelia and Faith walk to school in a large and
lively group of children, all wearing big backpacks.
INT. LIVING ROOM. DAY
Cam sits in his red armchair, watching TV, smoking. He is
unshaven and unkempt. He wears tube socks, a red smoking
jacket and tight tennis shorts. Amelia marches in and tapes
a sign on the TV screen that reads “SMOKING SUCKS AND THEN
YOU DIE!” Faith tapes one underneath with a picture of a big
black lung that says: “DEAD SMOKER’S ACTUAL LUNG!”
Cam stares blankly at the signs taped to the television.

CAM
I’m depressed.
Amelia sits down on the floor and starts tying her sneakers.
AMELIA
Of course you are. Your family

to live on, you can’t hold down a
job, and you annoy people.
CAM
You left out my hemorrhoids.
FAITH

Where are you going?
Out.

AMELIA
I’m meeting Kim and Ali.

Can I come?

AMELIA
(half-hearted)
I guess.
CAM
Can I come?
AMELIA/FAITH
(outraged)
No! God! We’re going to hang out
with our friends!

How come you never invite your
friends over here?

To this shithole?
CAM
Stop saying that.

And

CAM
How am I supposed to have my own
life when you won’t let me do
anything -They leave, slamming the door.
INT. HALLWAY. MOMENTS LATER
Amelia and Faith wait by the elevator. Cam opens the
apartment door and stands at the end of the hall, looking at
them mournfully. They are both furious. They look away.
They look back. He is still staring at them. They exchange
a look. They are pained by his misery. Finally, they
relent:
AMELIA
Fine. We’re hanging out at the
picnic tables.
The elevator doors open.

The girls get on.

77.
EXT. CONCRETE PARK. DAY
Kim, Ali and Thurgood sit at the metal picnic tables. Faith
and Amelia are across from them. Amelia has her Tarot cards
and she is doing a Tarot reading. She flips a card.
AMELIA
The Death card.
KIM
Does that mean I’m going to die?
AMELIA
Not necessarily...
Cam stands at the end of the table, digging stuff out of his
pockets, looking for matches.
CAM
Any of you kids got a light?
Amelia and Faith shoot him a withering look.

Amelia starts

Amelia looks at Thurgood who shakes his head.

law school -- he freaks out if
there’s kid noise.

You’re all welcome to come over to
our apartment...
Faith and Amelia look at each other, furious.

They both

AMELIA
Cam, can we speak to you for a
minute?
Faith and Amelia pull him aside, away from the other kids.
Cam looks uneasy.

78.
AMELIA
I am about to lose my shit. We
said you could come hang out with
us. We did not say you could
invite people into the apartment.
CAM
But I think it could be fun -No.

AMELIA
Not fun. Humiliating.

FAITH
Do we need to spell it out for you?
CAM
But I’ll make tea for everybody.
And cinnamon toast. We’ve got lots
of board games -AMELIA
(hissing)
We don’t want people to see how we
live!
CAM
(exploding)
Big deal how you live! It’s not
your fault! Tell them your Dad’s
manic-depressive or bi-polar or
whatever they’re calling it these
days! Don’t not have friends
because of me!
The girls are thrown by this outburst.
Fuck it.

CAM
Forget it.

Cam slumps.

Never mind.

He turns and walks back to the building, defeated.
Amelia look at each other, considering.

Faith and

INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY. DAY
Amelia and Faith stand outside their apartment with Thurgood,
Kim and Ali. Amelia takes her keys from around her neck.
AMELIA
I’m warning you. You’ve never seen
anything like this.
THURGOOD
I’ve been to messy houses before.

Faith raises her eyebrows.

Cam blinks, surprised.
Really?

CAM

Amelia nods and closes the door.
INT. APARTMENT. DAY
Amelia and Faith stand in the middle of the squalor with
Thurgood, Kim and Ali, who seem stunned by the mess.

Hey!

KIM
This is cool!

Kim happily bounces on the mini-trampoline in the middle of
all the squalor.
CUT TO:
The children fill the living room:
Amelia, Faith and Ali play Roulette.
Thurgood sits cross-legged on the mini-trampoline, bouncing
gently and staring at the album cover of “Guys and Dolls.”
Kim examines an old wooden cane. She pulls the handle and a
sword comes out. She is totally amazed.
Cam emerges from the kitchen with a teapot and a plate of
cinnamon toast points. He serves them all toast and refills
their teacups.
Cam has never seemed happier.
CAM
Would anyone like to learn how to
make chocolate truffles from
scratch?
Me!

THURGOOD

He leaps to his feet and follows Cam into the kitchen.
EXT. HILLSIDE. DAY
Cam comes into view, striding up the hill, whacking at the
tall grasses with his machete. Behind him, the children
begin to appear; they march behind him, fanning out on either
side, talking and laughing: Amelia, Faith, Kim, Ali,
Thurgood, and three other kids from school.
EXT. WOODS. LATER
The gang of children spreads out, searching the ground for
mushrooms and playing.
CUT TO:

81.
The children sit on a fallen tree trunk, watching, as Cam
demonstrates on Amelia how to twist someone’s arm behind
their back. Amelia grabs his arm and does it to him.
CUT TO:
Cam crams the kids into the Toyota. He lays the boys down in
the way back like cord wood. The engine turns over twice and
starts. The car is weighed down and drags in the back as Cam
drives slowly down the dirt road.
INT. KITCHEN. DAY
Amelia watches as Maggie frosts a birthday cake. Maggie
starts to pipe “Happy Birthday Faith” in white icing on the
top.
AMELIA
I don’t think I’m black.
MAGGIE
Of course you’re black.
AMELIA
But I look white.
MAGGIE
Sweetie, you’re black.
AMELIA
Faith looks black.
Daddy.

I look like

MAGGIE
You’re a mix of both of us.
AMELIA
Nobody thinks I’m black. When I
tell them. Nobody thinks I look
like you.
MAGGIE
Amelia, I am black. Your mother is
black. So you’re black.
Maggie runs out of space on the cake, halfway through
“Faith.”
Damn it.

MAGGIE

She throws down the pastry bag.

Amelia feels guilty.

82.
AMELIA
You know, you and Daddy could go
out to dinner some time. We don’t
need a babysitter.
You don’t?

MAGGIE

Amelia shakes her head.
AMELIA
We used to get scared, but we’re
not scared anymore.
Maggie puts her hand on Amelia’s head and looks at her.
MAGGIE
You’ve gotten so old.
AMELIA
(smiling)
If it makes you feel better, I’ll
tell people I’m black. Even if
they think I’m delusional.
EXT. STREET.

NIGHT

Cam and Maggie walk to a restaurant. They are both nicely
dressed, wearing scarves and overcoats.
MAGGIE
I think the last time we were at
Legal Seafood, Faith pulled shrimp
scampi all over my silk blouse.
CAM
You were so sad.
MAGGIE
It was my best shirt.
CAM
That was the same dinner where she
trundled across the room and
punched me right in the nuts.
MAGGIE
(laughing)
You were so sad.
He nods, laughs.

Amelia told me she doesn’t think
she’s black.

What? Her mother’s black. She’s
just testing you, being feisty.
She smiles at him with real gratitude.

MAGGIE
She also said they’re not scared

really good place.

so hard in the knee she put him on
crutches.
Wow.

MAGGIE

CAM
I felt quite proud.
MAGGIE
You seem good too, Cam.
So do you.

CAM
Well whaddaya know.

You never said anything about this

MAGGIE
I’m done nagging you to clean your

CAM
And my room is not inviting to you?
MAGGIE
(amused)
No! Not to me or anybody else.
Probably not even to you.
Cam laughs, good-naturedly.
CAM
Definitely not to me. I’m cleaning
it up. It’ll take me two days
tops. You’ll see. It’ll be a
thing of beauty.
They walk on.

INT. FINANCIAL FIRM. DAY
Maggie sits in a waiting room, professionally dressed,
completely pulled together. Across from her sit three
handsome 24-year-old white men. Suits, ties, polished shoes.
They are talking, laughing.

Twelve and ten. Very independent.
Which allows me to come in early
and work late --

BUSINESSMAN 1

Thank you so much. We’ll let you
know.
The men stand up, signalling the end of the meeting.
INT. FINANCIAL FIRM. DAY
As Maggie walks past three young men in their nice suits and
ties, she understands her prospects.
EXT. STREET. DAY
Maggie waits on a corner in downtown Boston. She looks cold
and unhappy. She looks up the street and sees the red Toyota
wildly backing down the one-way street. Irate drivers honk
at Cam. He stops in front of her. She gets into the car.
INT. TOYOTA. CONTINUOUS
CAM
How’d the interview go?
Maggie puts on an upbeat front.
MAGGIE
Really well I think! I know a lot
of people are vying for this
position, but I think I’m very
qualified. And I’ve got some more
interviews.
CAM
Any one of these places would be
lucky to have you.
She smiles at him gratefully.
INT. CAM’S BEDROOM. DAY
Cam stands in the middle of his messy bedroom, pulling excess
books off the shelf and putting them in a box. He comes
across The Collected Poems of Robert Frost. He opens the
book. He sits down on the edge of the bed, reading.
Amelia calls from the kitchen:

87.
AMELIA (O.S.)
Daddy, do I add more butter for
each omelette?
As Cam turns the page:
CAM
(yelling)
Half a tablespoon and make sure you
let it get nut-brown.
Faith steps into the doorway. She is festooned with gold and
pink ribbons wrapped around her arms and upper torso.
FAITH
Did you start my costume?
CAM
...What costume?
FAITH
You know. My Flamenco dancer
costume for the talent show.
You’re making me a skirt.
Beat.
Right.

CAM

FAITH
(concerned)
Daddy, it’s tomorrow.
CAM
(lamely)
Right. I know.
I knew it!

FAITH
You’re not making it.

CAM
I am making it. I said I would
make it and I will.
FAITH
Can you even sew?
CAM
Hey, I was in the army.
FAITH
I want it to be all sparkly and
ruffly.

88.
CAM
You got it, buggins.
Faith claps her hands and excitedly breaks into her stomping
Flamenco dance. The neighbor below bangs on the ceiling.
INT. APARTMENT. NIGHT
Cam opens a closet door and hauls Maggie’s sewing machine off
the top shelf.
CUT TO:
Dining room table. Cam sits in front of the sewing machine,
a cigarette dangling from his lips. He studies Faith’s
Flamenco doll.
CAM
I just have to make this skirt, two
hundred times bigger.
CUT TO:
He draws a pattern on the pink satin fabric. He cuts out the
pattern, smoking all the while. A huge amount of ash drops
on the fabric. He doesn’t notice.
CUT TO:
He pushes the fabric through the sewing machine. This way.
That way. The table is covered with dirty coffee cups. His
ashtray overflows with cigarette butts. He screws up a seam.
CAM
Goddamnit! I can’t do it!
fucking do it!

I can’t

He yanks the fabric out of the sewing machine, throws it on
the floor, jumps on it, picks it up, throws it at the wall,
it flutters to the floor. This only fuels his rage. He
spastically grabs it, crosses to the open window and hurls
out the unfinished skirt. He pushes his hair back, looks
around wild-eyed and crazy.
EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING. NIGHT
He wades through a bush to retrieve the skirt.

Cam has returned to working on the skirt.

He picks up

CAM
(into phone)
Guess what I did?
INTERCUT WITH MAGGIE
She turns on her bedside lamp and sits up, trying to orient
herself.
MAGGIE
Cam... it’s almost four in the
morning.
Cam examines the skirt with pride.
CAM
I just made your daughter an
incredible skirt. Sparkles,
ruffles... It’s probably my
greatest achievement since I
rebuilt the engine to my Dad’s
Studebaker in college.
MAGGIE
That’s terrific, Cam. You should
probably get some sleep.
CAM
I don’t want to sleep.

90.
MAGGIE
But you must be tired -CAM
But I’m not tired.
Maggie sits up.
MAGGIE
Cam, you know how important sleep
is to -CAM
Come on, Maggie! Name me one other
father in America who is up right
now sewing their daughter a
flamenco skirt!
MAGGIE
Cam... You are taking your
lithium... aren’t you?
Beat.
CAM
Actually, I haven’t taken my
lithium since you left.
Maggie hangs her head.
CAM
I find that if I take small, steady
sips of beer throughout the day, it
keeps me on an even keel...
He takes a long, loud, defiant sip of his beer.
Ahhh...

CAM

Maggie looks stricken.
INT. APARTMENT. MORNING
Cam sits on the floor surrounded by bits of fabric.
Faith manages to squeeze into the very beautiful and way too
tight skirt. It is so tight all the way down, she can barely
move her legs. She finally gets it on and stares down at it.
She wiggles to make the ruffle move. Then:
FAITH
I look like a flamenco mermaid!

91.
She hops over to Cam, throws her arms around his neck and
says dramatically:
FAITH
It’s the most glorious skirt I’ve
ever known!
EXT. STATION. SAME DAY
Maggie walks out of the train station. Cam is double-parked.
He wears his battered corduroy jacket and an Oxford shirt.
Maggie gets in the car, closes the door.
INT. TOYOTA STATION WAGON. CONTINUOUS
They sit in silence.
CAM
I’m not manic.
MAGGIE
But you could be.
CAM
I was excited. People are allowed
to get excited when they can’t sew
worth a damn and they manage to
pull off a flamenco skirt that gets
their daughter the second-most
applause at the talent show.
INT. RESTAURANT.

DAY

A tony Boston restaurant. The lunch crowd is well-dressed.
Cam and Maggie cross to sit down at the bar. Cam is angry.
MAGGIE
You promised to take your lithium.
CAM
And you promised to love me for
better or for worse.
The MAITRE D’ hurries over to them.
MAITRE D’
Excuse me, sir. But our dress code
requires you to wear a tie...
Without missing a beat, Cam pulls an untied bowtie out of his
jacket pocket. As he ties it without looking:

92.
CAM
Let me say one thing about lithium - no one even knows if it works.
Same goes for haldol, valproic
acid, and all their other so-called
treatments. I’m just a guinea pig.
And you never would’ve known I’d
stopped taking it if I hadn’t told
you. I’m an idiot. A fucking selfdestructive fuckhead.
His bowtie is perfectly tied. The Maitre D’ nods and quickly
retreats from this conversation.
MAGGIE
Cam, you said you would take
responsibility for your condition -CAM
The way you’ve taken responsibility
for your children?
MAGGIE
That’s not fair. You know how hard
this was for me.
CAM
I know, I know, it was hard to come
every weekend...
MAGGIE
No! It wasn’t hard to come, it
wasn’t hard to come...
Tears suddenly roll down Maggie’s face.

Cam is startled.

MAGGIE
...it was hard to leave. Every
weekend. And have people think I
was the worst mother in the world
because I wanted my children to
have a better life and I didn’t see
any other way to get it. You’re
from an old blue-blood family.
When you live in squalor, it’s
“eccentric.” When black people
live in squalor, believe me, no one
is charmed.
Cam is quiet for a moment as that sinks in.
CAM
If it’s any consolation, no one
seems charmed by my squalor either.

Maggie looks at him and nods, resigned.

Then:

I’m going to take the E.F. Hutton
job. In New York. It’s my only
offer.
CAM
New York? Maggie, I can’t keep
doing this all by myself -She puts her hand on his arm.
MAGGIE
I’m not asking you to. You’ve done
an amazing job. It’s time for me
to take the girls.
Cam reacts.
CAM
You’re taking the girls to New
York? But what about me and you?
What about us?
Maggie looks away.

She is anguished.

I knew it.

Cam seethes.

CAM
I knew it.

MAGGIE
There’s so much I love about you,
Cam. And I don’t want to give up
on you. But I just... I can’t.
CAM
So were you even trying to get a
job here? Or was this your plan
all along?
MAGGIE
No! My plan was to come home and
maybe I’d be with you and maybe I
wouldn’t, but we’d still be a
family. But none of that matters.
These Boston firms don’t want me.
CAM
Why don’t they want you?

DICK
I have to say, Cam, this is why we
never invite you to the Christmas

CAM
I don’t give a shit about your

hire my wife. She works fifty
thousand times harder than any of
you!
Dick gets up from the desk.
DICK
I’m afraid I have to ask you to
leave.
CAM
Do you have any idea how hard it
is? Do you have any idea what
sacrifices she’s made? She needs a
job here! In Boston!
Cam picks up a model sailboat and hurls it at the wall.

Cam picks up a chair and throws it at the bookcase, which
comes down. Dick tackles him to the floor.

Cam doesn’t look at her.

He takes out his bottle of lithium.

is a chilly day, he wears denim overalls, a striped denim
workshirt and a denim cap. The girls play Chinese jumprope
with Kim and Ali at the other end of the park. Maggie sits
at the picnic table, near Cam, watching her daughters play
with their friends.
Thurgood runs into the park area and stops in front of Cam.
THURGOOD
You’ve been working on the
railroad.
CAM
All the live-long day.
Thurgood laughs and runs off to join the other kids.
smiles. Cam stares into the fire.
CAM
I can’t visit you in New York.
Too much speed and noise and all
the people out on the streets all
night. Winds me up. Knocks me off
track.
MAGGIE
(nods)
I was just thinking about that.
CAM
I do understand why you don’t want
to live with me. I’m a much better
father than I was a husband.
MAGGIE
You know what Faith said to me last
night? She said: “You don’t lose
your temper like Daddy and you keep
the apartment nice, but the thing
about Daddy is he’s always around.
He’s always there.”
CAM
I thought that irritated them.

Maggie

100.
He reaches through the flames and turns the shishkebabs with
long metal tongs. Maggie stares off. Then she takes a deep
breath.
MAGGIE
I have a plan. I take this job and
earn some money. The girls stay
here with you. They keep riding
their bikes. They stay with their
friends. But we get them into a
good private school where they can
be challenged. I insist on that.
Maggie.

CAM
Are you sure?

Maggie stands and walks over to Cam.
MAGGIE
If they come to New York they’ll be
shut up like house pets in some
dark apartment and I’ll be working
till eight o’clock at night, every
night. I don’t want that for them.
Maggie looks over at the girls.

Her heart breaks.

MAGGIE
They’re my babies.
Maggie buries her face in her hands.

Cam holds out his arms.

ANGLE ON THE CHINESE JUMPROPE
Amelia is jumping.

Kim looks over Amelia’s shoulder.

KIM
I thought your parents were
divorced.
FAITH
(sighing)
No, they’re married.
KIM
But your Mom doesn’t live with you?
No.

AMELIA
Except on the weekends.

THURGOOD
So are they married on the
weekends?

101.
AMELIA
Sort of, not really...
Amelia turns to look at her parents at the other end of the
park. Maggie has collapsed into Cam’s arms and she is
sobbing. Cam is sobbing too. He still holds the metal
tongs. Amelia watches them for a long time. Then:
AMELIA
It’s hard to explain.
INT. TOYOTA STATION WAGON. DAY
Cam drives the car on the highway, smoking. A CAT is draped
over Cam’s shoulders while he drives. The girls are sleeping
in the backseat under a blanket. Amelia yawns and stirs.
Daddy?

AMELIA
How much longer?

CAM
(pleasantly surprised)
You’re awake. I thought you were
going to sleep the whole way home.
He quickly stabs out his cigarette.

Faith squirms awake.

CAM
We just crossed into Massachusetts.
We’re making great time.
Faith climbs into the front passenger seat.
CAM
You both conked out so quickly.
Must’ve been a fun weekend.
It was.

FAITH
Mommy let me do her hair.

Cam drives. It’s quiet for a moment.
stares out the window, then:

Amelia sits up and

AMELIA
Do you know that Mommy has a
boyfriend in New York?
CAM
Of course I know.
He’s nice.

AMELIA
But I don’t like him.

102.
FAITH
Me neither.
Oh boy.

CAM
Poor Mommy.

AMELIA
Why poor Mommy?
CAM
Because it’s hard to conduct a
romance when your children are
gunning for your lover.
Ew!

AMELIA/FAITH
Lover!

CAM
Lover, swain, beau, whatever.
AMELIA
How come you always feel so sorry
for Mommy?
Cam sighs and looks sad.
CAM
Because Mommy tries hard. She
wanted things to go differently.
Me too.
Me too.

AMELIA
FAITH

Cam smiles.
Me three.

CAM

The girls laugh. Then Faith looks back at her sister and
rolls her eyes with irritation.
FAITH
Daddy, Amelia’s about to cry.
Cam looks in the rearview at Amelia who is crying.
CAM
Big Little... what is it?
AMELIA
I just... I worry about you.

103.
CAM
Please, darling. Don’t worry about
me. I’ll be fine.
They drive in silence. Then, starting in an absurdly deep
voice, Cam breaks into “Annie Laurie.” He sings in a full
Scottish brogue, his voice getting very high and squeaky and
forlorn on the chorus.
CAM
Maxwellton Braes are bonnie
Where early lies the dew
Twas there that Annie Laurie
Gave me her Promise True
Gave me her promise true...
And ne’er forgot shall be...
For Bonnie Annie Laurie, I’d lay me
doon and dee...
The girls join in.

As they sing, a series of cuts:

-- Cam takes Amelia and Faith on a walk through Mt. Auburn
Cemetery.
-- Amelia runs between the shelves of books in an overstuffed
bookstore. She rounds the corner and nestles in next to Cam
who sits on the floor, with Faith on his lap.
-- Cam proudly leads Amelia, Faith, Thurgood, Kim and Ali on
a tour through the grand old mansion on Beacon Hill. The
children are blown away by the splendor. As they file past
Mr. Fabrini on their way out, thanking him, he nods curtly
and gives them all a very tight smile. He is clearly
extremely annoyed by Cam and can’t wait to get rid of him.
Cam grins back at him, victorious.
BACK TO:
INT/EXT. TOYOTA STATION WAGON. DAY
They sing together.
ALL THREE
Like dew on the gowan lying
Is the tread of her fairy feet
And like winds in summer sighing
Her voice is low and sweet
Her voice is low and sweet...
(high and squeaky)
She’s all the world to me...
And for bonnie Annie Laurie, I’d
lay me doon and dee...

104.
They speed down the highway.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. SHADY HILL SCHOOL ATHLETIC FIELDS.

DAY

AMELIA, wearing the school athletic uniform, her hair pulled
back in a tidy french braid, stands with eight other girls at
lacrosse practice. They are lined up, taking turns shooting
on goal. A TITLE CARD READS: One year later.
Amelia runs forward and fires a ball into the net.
CAM (O.S.)
Nice shot, Amelia!
Amelia waves at Cam, who is cheering from the sidelines.
Another girl runs and shoots into the net.
CAM (O.S.)
Nice shot, Amelia’s friend!
Amelia jogs back to the line of girls.
SHS TEAM MATE
How come your dad always comes to
practice?
AMELIA
(matter-of-fact)
He’s got nothing else to do.
ON CAM
He gives Amelia a thumbs up.
some pictures.

He drops to his knee and takes
CUT TO:

Practice is over. Amelia is laughing with her friends as
they put the lacrosse balls in a bag and pick up the cones.
Faith runs up to Amelia. Faith is wearing an SHS sweatshirt
and eyeglasses. Together the girls run over to Cam as he
puts a new roll of film in his camera. The rest of the team
heads back to the gym.
AMELIA
Daddy, Annie invited me for a
sleepover, can I go? Please?

105.
FAITH
And Fifi asked if I wanted to go
with her family to the movies.
CAM
But I finally convinced Eliot
Perkins to let me borrow his boat.
I thought we could have a picnic on
the river.
AMELIA
It’s too late to go out on a boat.
CAM
It’s four o’clock.
AMELIA
I really want to go to Annie’s.
CAM
Maybe Annie wants to take a ride
down the Charles River.
Daddy...

AMELIA

CAM
I’m serious. She lives in Boston.
How many times has she gotten a
ride home on a boat?
Now they are the only ones left on the field.
AMELIA
She takes the T.
CAM
(to Faith)
What about Fifi, do you think she’d
like to have a picnic on the water?
FAITH
Her mom’s picking her up in twenty
minutes. Please can I go?
CAM
You will never find a more
beautiful boat or a more perfect
day to go out on the river.
They are unmoved.

Cam shakes his head, giving up.

106.
CAM
Okay, well, I guess I’ll tell the
Charles River to go fuck itself.
Both girls laugh at his ridiculous reaction.
AMELIA
Well, I have heard that the Charles
River is a real asshole.
Cam chuckles at that.
AMELIA
Thanks, Daddy.
He nods.

They both hug him.

He hugs them back.

FAITH
Bye, Daddy.
CAM
Oh, darlings, I’m so proud of you.
So’s Mommy.
Why?

AMELIA

CAM
We just are.
They back away from him, waving, then turn and head across
the field. He stands, watching them go. They glance back
over their shoulders, smile and wave again quickly. He waves
mournfully. They quicken their pace. Then he calls out:
CAM
I love you!
They stop dead. They whirl around and steam toward him.
They are completely enraged.
AMELIA
Don’t do that.
Do what?

CAM

AMELIA
Watch us walk away.
CAM
I’m just watching you walk.

107.
FAITH
Please don’t.
Why?

CAM

FAITH
You make us feel bad.
CAM
I don’t want you to feel bad.
FAITH
(stamping her foot)
Yes, you do! That’s why you stand
there looking all pathetic!
CAM
I’m just watching you walk across
the field, for chrissake! I think
I’m allowed!
The girls sigh, frustrated. Amelia steps toward him, looking
him dead in the eye. She is stern, deliberate.
AMELIA
Daddy. We are walking away now.
And we are not turning around. We
are not looking back.
CAM
I’m not asking you too!
They shake their heads.
FAITH
(angry)
We love you, Daddy.
AMELIA
(furious)
We love you. Goodbye.
The girls turn and link arms. They huddle close together and
walk away from him as quickly as they can. As they go, Faith
glances at her sister with concern. She puts her hand over
Amelia’s and squeezes it.
Don’t cry.

FAITH
Don’t cry.

Tears stream down Amelia’s face.

108.
AMELIA
(shakes her head)
Can’t help it.
ANGLE ON CAM
Hands in his pockets, he watches them walk away.
Pressed together, in lock-step, they cross the playing
fields. Autumn leaves skitter around their feet.
They keep walking.
look back.

They do not turn around.

They do not

Then, just before they recede from view, they stop and turn.
They face him from this great distance. He brightens and
holds up his hand. They each hold up a hand. He makes a
fist in the air as if to say courage, onward. The girls do
the same. The three of them stand like that for a moment.
Then Amelia and Faith turn and run in the opposite direction,
disappearing into the gymnasium.
Cam looks up at the sky. He smiles to himself. He pulls a
tam o’shanter with a red pompom from his pocket and puts it
on his head. He lights a cigarette and walks toward the
river.
FADE OUT.
