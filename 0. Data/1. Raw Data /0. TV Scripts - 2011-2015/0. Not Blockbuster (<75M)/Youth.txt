1. EXT. HOTEL GARDEN. DAY
A terribly English face, its pale skin flushed in the crisp
springtime sun. Short, fair hair. Jacket and tie. A highly
intelligent face, persuasive too. The face of a fifty-yearold man who is sitting, legs crossed, in the pretty garden of
a hotel.
Slightly behind him sit two younger assistants.
And behind them, a beautiful swimming pool. Only a few
bathers, all of them wrapped in identical, soft white robes.
A lazy, early morning, vacation atmosphere.
Jacuzzis dot the flawless lawn around the pool.
In the background, a magnificent hotel. Welcoming, dignified,
and luxurious all at once.
And framing the hotel, reigning over it, are the mountains.
The fifty-year-old man takes out a pack of cigarettes and is
about to light up when a calm, uncritical voice warns him.
CALM VOICE
You can’t smoke here.
FIFTY-YEAR OLD
Not even outside?
CALM VOICE
Not even inside.
The calm voice belongs to the man sitting across from him.
English, about eighty years old, in a soft beige jacket and
trousers, and eyeglasses with imposing black frames, behind
which nest watery, light blue eyes, laden with melancholy and
cunning. We’re talking about Fred Ballinger.
There’s a small table between them. An open newspaper in
front of Fred. He is calm, placid, serene, but a vague
disenchantment hovers in his eyes. In what we realize is a
habitual gesture, he unwraps a candy and pops it in his
mouth. He’s clearly a regular consumer of such candies.
FIFTY-YEAR OLD
Pardon me, Mr. Ballinger, or may I
call you Maestro?
Fred Ballinger shrugs his shoulders. It really doesn’t matter
to him.
FIFTY-YEAR OLD (CONT’D)
And may I ask how your holiday is
going?
FRED BALLINGER
Very well, thank you.

2.

FIFTY-YEAR OLD
Have you been coming here long?
FRED BALLINGER
For more than twenty years. I used
to come with my wife. Then I kept
coming on my own, I have many
friends here.
FIFTY-YEAR OLD
Why Switzerland, Maestro?
FRED BALLINGER
It's close to Italy. And I directed
the Venice orchestra for twentyfour years. After London and New
York, of course.
FIFTY-YEAR OLD
But of course, how silly of me!
This must also be a very good place
to relax.
FRED BALLINGER
It’s only a place to relax.
The fifty-year old smiles. Fred doesn’t.
FIFTY-YEAR OLD
Are you still directing or
composing, Maestro?
FRED BALLINGER
No, I’m retired.
FIFTY-YEAR OLD
It goes without saying, of course,
that I, like everyone else, am a
great admirer of yours.
FRED BALLINGER
Thank you.
The fifty-year old smiles.
FIFTY-YEAR OLD
Maestro, as I indicated to you in
my letter, I work for the
Ceremonies and Events Office at
Buckingham Palace.
Fred stirs slightly when he hears this.
FRED BALLINGER
You work for the Queen?
FIFTY-YEAR OLD EMISSARY
Well, in a sense, yes!

3.

FRED BALLINGER
Good. Monarchies are always so
endearing.
FIFTY-YEAR OLD EMISSARY
(surprised) If I may, Maestro, why
exactly do you find the monarchy
endearing?
FRED BALLINGER
Because it’s so vulnerable.
Eliminate just one person and all
of a sudden the whole world
changes.
Like in a marriage.
FIFTY-YEAR OLD EMISSARY
Her Majesty the Queen would be
honored to confer a knighthood upon
you this coming June, Maestro.
A little smile darts across Fred’s face.
FRED BALLINGER
Do you know what Satie said when he
was offered the Legion of Honor?
“It’s not enough simply to refuse
it, you also have to not deserve
it.” But I am not Satie. And you
must excuse me, I have the most
dreadful habit of quoting other
people.
FIFTY-YEAR OLD EMISSARY
Her Majesty will be delighted to
learn you have accepted.
FRED BALLINGER
Her Majesty has never been
delighted about anything.
Embarrassed, the Queen’s emissary skates over Fred’s remark.
FIFTY-YEAR OLD EMISSARY
What is more, your investiture just
happens to coincide with the
birthday of His Royal Highness The
Prince Philip, and the Queen would
very much like to give him a
concert with the London
Philharmonic Orchestra at the New
Wimbledon Theatre, to which the
Prince is deeply attached, for
reasons unknown to me. Her Majesty
would be delight-- honored if you
would agree to conduct, your own
compositions of course.

4.

FRED BALLINGER
I haven’t conducted for a long
time.
FIFTY-YEAR OLD EMISSARY
(smiles) I’m sure you haven’t
forgotten how it’s done.
Fred Ballinger ponders this.
FRED BALLINGER
No, I haven’t forgotten how it’s
done.
The Queen’s emissary’s smiles radiantly.
FIFTY-YEAR OLD EMISSARY
Prince Philip and Her Majesty will
be simply ecstatic to hear you
conduct your famous “Simple Songs.”
In a remarkably calm, resigned voice, Fred says:
FRED BALLINGER
Ah, but I will not conduct any of
my “Simple Songs.”
FIFTY-YEAR OLD EMISSARY
Why not?
FRED BALLINGER
Personal reasons.
FIFTY-YEAR OLD EMISSARY
The great soprano Sumi Jo has
agreed to sing.
FRED BALLINGER
Sumi Jo won’t do.
FIFTY-YEAR OLD EMISSARY
Well then, tell me which soprano
would do, and you shall have her.
FRED BALLINGER
No one will do.
Fred Ballinger’s refusal seems irrevocable. He goes back to
reading the paper, all the flattery already behind him. The
emissary is devastated. He lowers his head.
Silence. Only a slight noise. The camera moves to discover
what it is. Fred is rubbing the plastic-coated candy wrapper
between his fingers at regular intervals. Without a doubt,
the quick, alternating tempo creates a distinct musical
rhythm.

5.

The Queen’s emissary puts a cigarette between his lips and is
about to light it when he remembers that smoking is not
permitted. He stammers out one last, lame attempt.
FIFTY-YEAR OLD EMISSARY
If I may, Maestro, the Queen might
take your refusal rather poorly,
she’s not used to being told no.
Fred Ballinger, who is reading the paper, interrupts ex
abrupto rubbing the candy wrapper.
FRED BALLINGER
I’m sure she will come to terms
with it. There are far more
important things in life than my
Simple Songs.
The emissary is disconsolate.
FIFTY-YEAR OLD EMISSARY
Well then, I shall relay our
conversation to the Queen. Good
day, Maestro.
The emissary takes his leave. His two assistants follow him.
When they get up, we see that there is a man sitting behind
them, who looks as if he has overheard the whole
conversation.
His name is Jimmy Tree. He’s thirty-four years old,
Californian, drop dead handsome, a Hollywood star. Though
it’s still early, he’s eating a steak and French fries.
Hiding behind sunglasses and a few days' razor stubble,
wearing an unflattering baseball cap and sloppy clothes, he
looks undone.
The three Englishmen are circumnavigating the pool on their
way out of the garden, when someone suddenly catches the
emissary’s attention.
This someone is floating in the pool: a man about fifty, only
his face above water. A puffy, South American face, hair dyed
a surreal yellow, full lips, tired features, dark,
intelligent eyes, and furrows far too deep for a man his age.
He stares blankly into space.
The emissary gazes at the South American and whispers to one
of his assistants.
FIFTY-YEAR OLD EMISSARY (CONT’D)
Do you see that man? Could it
really be him?
His two assistants turn to look at the man in the pool, and
recognize him immediately. They get all excited.

6.

FIRST ASSISTANT
Why yes, it is!
SECOND ASSISTANT
Good god, it really is him.
The three Englishmen keep walking, but they can’t keep from
glancing furtively at the South American who, with the help
of a woman in her forties and three lifeguards, whom he leans
on like a dead weight, is getting out of the pool. He
struggles up the low stairs, which to him seem
insurmountable.
As he slowly emerges from the water, we see how
extraordinarily obese he is, and how much trouble he has
walking. Panting, this cumbersome yet charismatic creature
settles himself at the edge of the pool. His arms are
swarming with tattoos: faces of famous heroes from famous
revolutions.
The lifeguards withdraw.
The forty-year-old woman with a kindly, patient face is his
companion, apparently. She sits next to him and lovingly rubs
his hair with a towel, caring for this immense whale.
FADE OUT.
2. EXT. VENICE. NIGHT
Guitar notes - irregular, sporadic, imploded, muffled sounds
that seem to come from the deepest depths of the sea or your
own conscience - surface now and then during the scene.
What we see next is like a vision.
A breathtakingly beautiful vision: high water in a deserted
Saint Mark’s Square. That vast space, with its unforgettable
porticos and palaces, is now a square lake, water lapping at
the columns.
A narrow, raised walkway intersects the Square. But there’s
no one on it, at least not right now.
Then, in the dead of night in this most mysterious city, Fred
Ballinger appears at the far end of the long walkway. Like
all old people, he looks vulnerable as he shuffles along,
taking tiny, trying steps.
Fred looks up and espies a statuesque female figure coming
toward him from the other end of the walkway. They move
toward each other, the only human beings in this surreal,
submerged Venice. They’re closer now, they’re about to meet.
With ill-concealed amazement, Fred fixes his eyes on the
woman: she’s 6’1”.

7.

An impossible beauty, with black hair and eyes so green they
seem fake, wearing a one-piece bathing suit and a sash that
says MISS UNIVERSE.
She’s even closer now, approaching him with the solemn,
inhuman gait of a top model in a big-time fashion show.
They’re about to meet. But the walkway is only three feet
wide, so they both move aside to let the other pass without
falling in the water. It’s inevitable that they touch. Miss
Universe’s plentiful decolleté brushes against Fred’s scrawny
chest.
He gazes up at her from below, as if he were beholding a
benign tragedy.
Like all beauty queens, she stares coldly into space, not
even noticing her perfect body’s fleeting contact with Fred.
Having avoided a mishap, they each proceed on their way. The
beauty queen sways off into the full moon, surrounded by that
expanse of water, like in some debatable Dolce & Gabbana
dream.
Fred shuffles along the walkway. He’s afraid now, and with
good reason: the water is rising quickly, flooding the
walkway and swirling around his feet, his ankles, his knees.
Fred tries to hurry, but he’s old and the water tugs at his
legs. He turns and cries out in a suffocated voice, as if
begging Miss Universe for help.
FRED BALLINGER
Melanie, Melanie!
But Miss Universe is no longer there, it’s as if she
evaporated.
Fred keeps going, but not for much longer. The water is up to
his chest now, his neck, his chin, he’s panicked, a stifling
guitar note sounds, when, luckily...
3. EXT. HOTEL GARDEN. NIGHT
... he wakes up. Fred quickly regains his composure. He
struggles up from his chair. It’s late. No one’s around.
Except for a small crowd of guests in the distance, real
night owls.
The guitar notes flow now, crisp and real.
Fred takes tiny steps toward them, the underwater pool lights
providing a shadowy glow.
As he shuffles across the deserted lawn, the OPENING CREDITS
start to roll, and a voice joins in with the guitar, it’s
coming from the little group of people.

8.

The song is “Onward,” a magnificent, somber, American folk
ballad. Fred instinctively heads toward the music.
Fred hovers near the edge of the gathering, where Mark
Kozelek, guitar in his lap, is singing “Onward.” Three women,
a twenty-year-old kid, and Jimmy Tree are there as well. The
little group, all mellow and relaxed, listens contentedly to
the great American folksinger.
The OPENING CREDITS continue to roll as Fred Ballinger,
standing slightly apart, listens to the beautiful ballad.
Mark Kozelek notices him and is unable to conceal his emotion
at having such a distinguished spectator.
Mark gives a reverential little bow with his head and then,
during an instrumental break, says to Fred.
MARK KOZELEK
Maestro.
Fred smiles slightly.
The OPENING CREDITS are over.
Jimmy Tree is stretched out on the grass, eyes closed. He
opens his eyes and sees Fred. They nod hello to each other;
then Jimmy gestures aimiably to him to join him. Fred goes
over and sits near Jimmy, perching on the edge of a chaise
lounge. Jimmy offers him a mug.
JIMMY TREE
I slipped a bit of gin and tonic
into the herbal tea. Interested,
Mr. Ballinger?
FRED BALLINGER
No, thanks. I'd prefer a bit of
herbal tea slipped into a gin and
tonic.
They both smile.
Fred takes out a cloth handkerchief, quickly blows his nose,
expertly folds his handkerchief and, in a habitual gesture he
has clearly done a million times, quickly wipes his nose four
times, then puts his handkerchief back in his jacket pocket.
Jimmy Tree, an irresistible smile on his face, has observed
Fred’s handkerchief routine with utmost attention.
JIMMY TREE
I was thinking today that you and I
have the same problem.
FRED BALLINGER
Is that so.

9.

JIMMY TREE
We’ve been misunderstood our whole
lives because we allowed ourselves
to give in - just once - to a
little levity.
FRED BALLINGER
Perhaps. Because levity is an
irresistible temptation.
JIMMY TREE
I’ve worked with all the great
European and American directors,
but I’ll be remembered forever for
Mister Q, for a fucking robot. I
had to wear a suit of armor that
weighed two hundred pounds, you
couldn’t even see my face. But
every five minutes someone has to
come up and remind me that I did
Mister Q, the same way they remind
you that you did those “Simple
Songs.” And they forget that you
also composed “The Black Prism,”
“The Life of Hadrian,” and all the
rest.
Fred Ballinger smiles and so does Jimmy. They’re accomplices
now.
FRED BALLINGER
Because levity is also a
perversion. What are you doing in
Europe?
JIMMY TREE
I’m doing a new film, in Germany,
starting in a month. I’m developing
the role.
FRED BALLINGER
Is it a lighthearted role?
JIMMY TREE
That depends on your point of view.
FRED BALLINGER
Is it coming along well?
JIMMY TREE
We’ll see.
Mark Kozelek breathes the last note of “Onward.” The little
group claps languidly. Fred doesn’t join in. Then, struggling
to get up, he takes his leave of Jimmy.
FRED BALLINGER
It’s late for me.

10.

JIMMY TREE
Not for me.
Fred smiles. Jimmy salutes him playfully, two fingers to his
temple.
Fred moves off with the uncertain gait of an old man. Jimmy
drinks and observes Fred's slow walk.
4. INT. HOTEL RECEPTION/ELEVATOR. NIGHT
Fred Ballinger stands immobile in the lobby, across from the
reception desk. He’s waiting for the elevator.
A young night doorman stares blankly at a small, silent TV.
A very petite, dignified-looking woman, who looks older than
her sixty years, rings the doorbell. The doorman, without
taking his eyes off the TV, presses a button and buzzes her
in. The woman enters and sits on a bench. Melancholy and
resigned, she stares into space. Fred Ballinger, still
waiting for the elevator, has watched all this, his face
expressionless.
Finally, the elevator. An old contraption with a metal grate.
Fred steps inside. The elevator ascends. We see his
silhouette rising.
4A. INT. HOTEL ELEVATOR/CORRIDOR. NIGHT
It stops at his floor. A chubby, unattractive young woman,
about twenty, is waiting to take the elevator down. Her face
is pocked here and there with pimples, an adolescent
peculiarity that clashes with her sharp, aggressive look. We
can safely assume that she’s a hooker, but a hooker sui
generis.
Fred forgets to look at her, and she pays no attention to
him.
Alone, Fred Ballinger makes his way down the hallway, taking
tiny, slow steps. Next to every door are pairs of hiking
boots, neatly arranged, which the guests have put out to be
aired.
In the silence of the night, an old man in an electric
wheelchair overtakes Fred and vanishes around a corner.
The sound of a violin comes from one of the rooms, stopping
Fred in his tracks. He turns, searching for the source. It
starts up again, from the beginning: only two notes, played
poorly. Someone’s obviously practicing, one of those really
tedious exercises.
Fred takes a step in the direction of the sound, but it stops
again.

11.

He is about to keep walking when he encounters his reflection
in a mirror. He touches a sunspot on his temple, which he
notices for the first time there in the mirror.
5. INT. MICK BOYLE’S SUITE. NIGHT
Those same violin notes start up again, but extra-diegetic
now, and perfectly executed. They give life to a soft,
melancholic music.
We’re in a room where confusion reigns: papers and notes
spread all over the place, laptop computers left open and
forgotten. Five kids - four guys and a girl - all under
thirty, are sleeping, curled up in armchairs scattered here
and there, and on the bed. They are sleeping the sleep of the
just.
Fred Ballinger and another elderly man are standing in the
room, he too about eighty years old, still attractive, his
hair a little long, his bright, sparkling eyes omnivorous and
full of life. His name is Mick Boyle.
The two old men silently observe the sleeping kids. The
violin vanishes. After a while.
FRED BALLINGER
Did you take a piss today?
MICK BOYLE
Twice. Four drops. You?
FRED BALLINGER
Same. More or less.
MICK BOYLE
More or less?
FRED BALLINGER
Less.
MICK BOYLE
Look how beautiful they are.
FRED BALLINGER
Beautiful, yes.
MICK BOYLE
If you only knew how moving it is
to see them working on the
screenplay. They’re so passionate.
FRED BALLINGER
They’ve caught your passion.
MICK BOYLE
And have you lost yours?

12.

Fred just shrugs.
Mick, with what is clearly a habitual gesture, smooths his
hair across his forehead with the palm of his hand, and then
changes the subject.
MICK BOYLE (CONT'D)
See those two?
He points to the girl and one of the guys, who are sleeping
on opposite sides of the room.
FRED BALLINGER
Of course I see them.
MICK BOYLE
They're falling in love, but they
don't know it yet.
The girl, her eyes still closed, gives a smile that no one
sees. Because she’s not asleep.
FRED BALLINGER
How do you know?
MICK BOYLE
(reflects)I know because I know
everything there is to know about
love.
FRED BALLINGER
Then you'll have to give me lessons
one of these days.
MICK BOYLE
It's late now.
Have you heard the latest? Joyce
Owens, Miss Universe, is coming to
stay. Apparently one of her prizes
is a free week in our hotel.
FRED BALLINGER
Yeah, I heard. But it seems more
like a punishment than a prize to
me.
MICK BOYLE
Which is just how it should be.
Some forms of beauty have to be
punished, to make life bearable for
the rest of us.
FRED BALLINGER
How’s the screenplay coming along?
MICK BOYLE
It’s going to be my masterpiece. My
testament.
(MORE)

13.
MICK BOYLE (CONT'D)
And Brenda is going to make an
unforgettable leading lady. We hit
on the title today: “Life’s Last
Day.” What do you think?

FRED BALLINGER
(reflects) It’s good. I’m going to
bed.
Fred heads out while in the background Mick shakes one of the
kids.
MICK BOYLE
Come on, guys, wake up, it's time
to go back to your hotel.
6. INT. FRED BALLINGER’S SUITE. NIGHT
A beautiful woman, about forty, sleeps soundly in the bed.
Her name is Lena.
A sweeping shot of the room. We see the night stand, with a
framed photograph from ten years ago, of Fred being hugged by
a woman his age. They smile happily in the photo. We can
assume it’s his wife.
The sweeping shot ends on Fred, sitting in a chair. He’s
staring bright-eyed at the sleeping woman.
Lena opens her eyes and sees Fred. She’s surprised.
LENA
Aren’t you sleeping, Daddy?
Fred, trying to hide his tears, smiles sadly.
FRED BALLINGER
No, I’m looking at you.
Lena notices her father’s tears.
LENA
But Daddy, you’re...
FRED BALLINGER
(anticipates what she is going to
say) Don’t worry. Old people cry
all the time. And for no good
reason.
6A. EXT. HOTEL GARDEN. DAWN.
Early morning dew. The extensive hotel grounds, punctuated
here and there by beautiful, centuries-old trees.

14.

The chubby hooker and the petite, sixty-year-old woman we saw
earlier at the reception desk appear, seen from behind.
They’re probably mother and daughter.
They walk hand in hand, sad and forgotten by the world.
With a awkward, inelegant gesture, the girl adjusts her very
short shorts, which have annoyingly worked their way in
between her buttocks.
Mick Boyle is sitting on a bench, looking over his work
notes. He senses the presence of the two women and looks up.
His eyes immediately grow melancholy when he sees the mother
and daughter walking hand in hand.
The sky beyond the high mountain peaks begins to brighten,
while the dew vanishes from the leaves of the garden’s
beautiful plants.
7. INT. FRED BALLINGER’S SUITE. DAY
Fred is on his stomach on a massage table. An eighteen-yearold girl, incredibly timid, slight, with delicate features,
is giving Fred a massage.
Lena looks out the window and sees an Asian man sitting at
the far end of the garden.
LENA
That guy who levitates is out
there.
FRED BALLINGER
I’ve been coming here for years.
He’s never levitated. So, where is
it you decided to go?
LENA
Polynesia. For two weeks. Julian
went overboard, as usual.
FRED BALLINGER
Good.
LENA
(smiling) You’ll be glad to have
the room all to yourself now. I was
in your way.
FRED BALLINGER
Not at all. You kept me company.
Mick is working and I get bored.
LENA
You won’t be bored now. I arranged
the full treatment for you.
(MORE)

15.
LENA (CONT'D)
Massage and sauna every day, checkups with the doctor... to help you
get back in shape.

FRED BALLINGER
At my age, getting back in shape is
merely a waste of time. I’m going
to be even more bored now.
LENA
You’re a victim of your own apathy,
Daddy. Why don’t you go to Venice
one of these days? You could bring
flowers to Mummy.
Fred doesn’t answer.
The masseuse is very discreet, it’s as if she weren’t
listening.
LENA (CONT'D)
By the way, the French write to me
every day. They’re really insisting
that you write your memoirs. What
should I do?
FRED BALLINGER
Let them insist.
Lena stares at her naked father being massaged. His body is
worn with age. A wave of tenderness washes across her face.
Sad now, she takes her leave.
LENA
Bye, Daddy, I’ll call you when we
get there.
FRED BALLINGER
Have fun.
Lena wheels her carry-on out of the room.
MASSEUSE
(Swiss accent) Would you mind
turning over on your back, please?
Her voice is that of a young girl, which makes her even more
charming. Fred turns over, though not without difficulty. The
masseuse starts rubbing his arms.
His eyes are closed, but he opens one slightly, on the sly,
to look at the girl’s face.

16.

7A. INT. HOTEL.(VARIOUS SETTINGS). DAY
7A/1
The day begins at this enormous compound, which is at once a
hotel, a spa, a medical center, a sports complex, and a
physical rehab facility. With established rhythms and welldefined schedules.
In fact, antique bells ring throughout the hotel, so that the
guests will not be late for their appointments.
7A/2 7A/3
Nurses and masseuses, all in uniform, emerge from sterile
changing rooms and head to their work stations.
7A/4
Doctors don white coats.
7A/5 7A/6 7A/7
The guests, most of them elderly, and all of them wearing
identical hotel bathrobes, form orderly lines and head to
their check-ups, or to the swimming pools, saunas, and
massage rooms.
The silent, serene, and sparsely attended activity of a world
just set in motion.
7A/8
The waiters, backlit, clear tables in the breakfast room.
7A/9
An anorexic cook heads out behind the kitchen. Enjoying the
first drag on his cigarette, he stares at the clear blue sky
above the mountains.
8. INT. MASSAGE ROOM. DAY
Soporific, new age music pervades the room.
In the darkness, relieved only by a sea of candles, Fred is
lying on an enormous straw crib, like an eighty-year-old baby
Jesus.
A little Thai man, about fifty, is placing burning black
stones on Fred’s body. Fred moans lightly in pain each time
one touches his skin.
The masseur smiles, then says in halting English.
MASSEUR
After pain come pleasure.
FRED BALLINGER
And then pain again.

17.

9. INT. HOTEL INFIRMARY. DAY
A nurse is drawing Fred’s blood.
A doctor, about sixty, comes in. He has a nice, kindly face.
DOCTOR
How’s it going, Mr. Ballinger?
FRED BALLINGER
It’s going. I don’t know where, but
it’s going.
The doctor smiles. Then he stops and looks at Fred’s face. He
puts his glasses on and examines Fred more attentively.
FRED BALLINGER (CONT’D)
My daughter says I’m apathetic. Is
it that obvious?
DOCTOR
(smiles) Would you like to have
those sunspots removed? We could
take them off with a laser.
FRED BALLINGER
No, why?
DOCTOR
Because they’re unsightly.
FRED BALLINGER
But they remind me of something
fundamental.
DOCTOR
What?
FRED BALLINGER
That my life is full of spots.
The doctor smiles. Fred smiles. The nurse has finished
drawing his blood. Fred looks out the window, which frames a
spotless mountain peak set against an unbelievably blue sky.
Fred is serious now.
10. INT. MICK BOYLE’S SUITE. DAY
The young screenwriters are in the middle of an argument.
Mick, immersed in a sea of papers, listens but doesn’t
intervene.
Fred comes in, but no one pays any attention to him. They’re
all too embroiled in their argument. So Fred listens
impartially.

18.

They’re all talking at once, it’s impossible to make out
everything they’re saying, but two of them, arguing fiercely,
are louder than the others.
Naturally, it’s the boy and the girl who, according to Mick,
are falling in love.
SCREENWRITER IN LOVE
You’ve been watching too many
movies, you idiot, you’ve forgotten
what life’s about!
FEMALE SCREENWRITER
Movies are life! All you know how
to do is criticize. If you only had
some inspiration for once.
He laughs and claps sarcastically.
A shy screenwriter, sitting next to Mick, comments under his
breath on their argument.
SHY SCREENWRITER
Exactly!
SCREENWRITER IN LOVE
Inspiration?! Didn’t they teach you
at film school that inspiration
doesn’t exist? Inspiration’s a lie.
There’s no such thing as
inspiration, only fermentation.
SHY SCREENWRITER
Exactly!
FEMALE SCREENWRITER
Inspiration exists, alright, you
just don’t recognize it, because
you have zero talent.
SHY SCREENWRITER
Exactly!
Mick, hearing the contradictory remarks coming from the shy
screenwriter sitting next to him, addresses him harshly.
MICK BOYLE
What the fuck are you doing?
Agreeing with everyone?
SHY SCREENWRITER
Of course! I'm timid and insecure.
My parents never gave me any
encouragement. My brother's
favorite sport was beating me up.
My sister called me "the failure".
(MORE)

19.
SHY SCREENWRITER (CONT'D)
I've never had a girlfriend, and I
also have serious doubts about my
sexual orientation.

Mick stifles a laugh.
MICK BOYLE
Stop it! You’re not going to move
me.
SHY SCREENWRITER
My aunt has polio.
Mick laughs.
SCREENWRITER IN LOVE
(furious) Don't you dare accuse me
of having no talent ever again, you
idiot.
FEMALE SCREENWRITER
Now’s not the time for
fermentation, you untalented
parasite.
MICK BOYLE
That’s enough, you’re really
getting on my nerves. We have to
come up with an ending, and you’re
wasting time talking philosophy and
big ideas.
Fred joins in.
FRED BALLINGER
But they’re right, Mick. It’s the
big ideas that give rise to all the
little ones.
Only now do the others realize Fred is there.
MICK BOYLE
Oh, Fred, you’re here. Listen, I
still have a couple of hours to go
here, and then I have to talk to
the doctor. I’ll find you after
that.
FRED BALLINGER
Okay.
Sad, and also a bit disappointed because no one even
commented on his observation, Fred leaves the room, while
Mick hounds his screenwriters.
MICK BOYLE
Well? Come on, who’s got an idea
for the ending?

20.

Another screenwriter, who hadn’t taken part in the argument,
speaks up. He has a long beard and tousled hair: the epitome
of a well-educated, ironic young man. As if having a vision,
he says dreamily.
INTELLECTUAL SCREENWRITER
So he’s on his deathbed, he can
barely talk, and he whispers to his
wife: “Don’t cry, honey. You know
I’ve always found women who weep
frivolous and repulsive.”
The two who had been fighting exchange a conspiratorial look
and start to laugh.
The timid, insecure screenwriter thinks for a moment and then
says with confidence.
SHY SCREENWRITER
Nice!
Mick throws him a disgusted look, then says.
MICK BOYLE
What a totally asinine idea. What
else?
11. EXT. HOTEL GARDEN. DAY
A deep torpor has settled over the hotel guests, as if they’d
been anesthetized. The silence is numbing. In the early
morning light, we watch a slow swarm of rich Russians drop
onto chaise lounges to sunbathe, and a handsome black
American family, immobile in the pool.
Off to one corner, outdoor massages are available, in the
shade of a beautiful canopy. Two teenage boys, in the swirl
of a hormonal tempest, are hanging around there, furtively
eyeing a beautiful woman who is getting an gentle, oriental
style massage.
Few guests, all of them wealthy.
We can make out a pair of parachutists in the distance, set
against the crisp, imposing mountains.
An elderly couple has dozed off in their electric
wheelchairs.
Their Asian caregivers are as discreet and invisible as mice.
A fifty-year old son does gymnastics with his decrepit
father.

21.

At the far end of the garden, near the hedges that act as a
fence, the obese South American is leaning on a cane and
signing autographs for a whole mix of people, all of whom
seem bewitched by their hero. His companion at his side. In
eternal apprehension, she regulates how much time each person
gets with her husband. Someone takes out a cell and snaps a
photo on the sly. She is furious and orders a complete
moratorium on photos of her husband.
Fred Ballinger, wrapped in a white robe and lying on a chaise
lounge, sucks on a candy and watches, with resigned interest,
the autograph-signing ritual. One hand dangling off the
chaise, he rubs the candy wrapper between his fingers, the
irregular tempo creating a clear rhythm.
Jimmy Tree is stretched out on a chaise lounge next to Fred.
He too is studying the South American, but seems more
interested in his cane. It’s of briarwood, made to look old,
all twisted and full of knots.
Jimmy looks around and something else catches his eye: a
mother is rubbing suntan lotion on her thirteen-year-old
daughter.
The girl, so pale you can almost see through her, stares at
the ground, as if overcome by a pathological timidness. Then,
for no apparent reason - she must have gotten nervous - she
starts biting her fingernails, practically devouring them.
After a while, the mother apparently tells her to stop,
because she gets all pissed off, screams at her mother, then
gets up and storms off.
Jimmy, an unlit cigarette dangling from his lips, studies her
like an entomologist.
The South American, leaning on his cane and his wife, is
coming across the garden. They skirt a deserted tennis court.
But his attention is drawn to a particular: a forgotten
tennis ball lies in the middle of the court.
11A. INT.PHARMACY.DAY
Fred and Mick stand next to each other at the counter of the
pharmacy.
Fred waits impassively while Mick, glasses perched on the tip
of his nose, checks to make sure that the pharmacist is
getting everything right.
The pharmacist places a whole range of drugs on the counter
in front of Mick, creating a veritable "mountain" of
medicine.
PHARMACIST'S VOICE
That's everything.

22.

MICK BOYLE
Good.
Mick turns to Fred, and only now does he realize that his
friend hasn’t asked for any medicine for himself. We can hear
the puzzlement in Mick’s voice as he asks.
MICK BOYLE (CONT'D)
Don’t you need anything?
So Fred, faking uncertainty, looks around the pharmacy and
fixes his gaze on the first shelf he happens to see, which
contains a full selection of Bandaids.
Fred grabs a random box of Bandaids and puts it on the
counter in front of the pharmacist.
Mick has observed Fred's actions closely.
MICK BOYLE (CONT’D)
What do you need Bandaids for?
FRED BALLINGER
I don’t. I’m getting them out of
solidarity with you.
Mick turns back to his mountain of medicine and speaks in a
voice that is halfway between serious and humorous. Barely
opening his mouth, he says to himself, but as if he were
speaking to Fred.
MICK BOYLE
Fuck you.
A wry smile appears on Fred Ballinger's face.
12. EXT. COUNTRY LANE. DAY
Fred and Mick stroll through a meadow in a beautiful valley,
with an expanse of trees to the right, and the mountain
village to the left.
The two friends are chatting.
FRED BALLINGER
Why do you think we come here on
holiday every year?
MICK BOYLE
Because you always want to go back
to the places that made you happy.
FRED BALLINGER
(smiles) That’s the screenwriter in
you talking.

23.

MICK BOYLE
I wish! Actually, it’s John
Cheever.
FRED BALLINGER
Do you remember Gilda?
MICK BOYLE
The film?
FRED BALLINGER
No, Gilda Black. The Gilda we both
were in love with.
MICK BOYLE
Gilda Black???
FRED BALLINGER
Gilda Black.
MICK BOYLE
(laughs) What are you going and
remembering her for? That was a
hundred years ago.
FRED BALLINGER
To me it seems like yesterday. I
would have given twenty years of my
life to sleep with her.
MICK BOYLE
Well that would have been a pretty
stupid thing to do! Gilda Black
wasn’t worth twenty years of your
life. She wasn’t worth a single
day.
Fred is suddenly incredibly disappointed and also somewhat
apprehensive.
FRED BALLINGER
How would you know? Did you sleep
with her?
Mick stammers, he realizes he has put his foot in his mouth.
MICK BOYLE
What? What did you say?
FRED BALLINGER
You heard me. Sixty years ago you
swore you never slept with her, out
of respect for my love for her. But
now you’ve changed your tune.
MICK BOYLE
Look, I have to confess something.

24.

FRED BALLINGER
Fine, go right ahead!
MICK BOYLE
The real tragedy -- and believe me,
it really is a tragedy -- is that I
can’t even remember if I slept with
Gilda Black.
FRED BALLINGER
Are you serious?
MICK BOYLE
Unfortunately, yes. I swear.
FRED BALLINGER
Well then, that changes things.
MICK BOYLE
How?
FRED BALLINGER
If you were sure you’d slept with
her, our friendship would be over
right this second. But if you’re
not sure, well, let’s just say...
that I can live with the
uncertainty.
MICK BOYLE
Anyway, if I did go to bed with her
and don’t remember it, that means
she wasn’t worth twenty years of
your life, wouldn’t you say?
FRED BALLINGER
Well yes, I guess you’re right. So
Gilda Black is a closed book
between us.
MICK BOYLE
Good. Have the kids left?
FRED BALLINGER
Your son wanted to do it up in
style: Polynesia.
MICK BOYLE
I know, he’s a real spendthrift,
that one. Who knows where he gets
it from.
FRED BALLINGER
Not from you, obviously.
Mick laughs. Silence. All of a sudden, Fred seems anxious. He
sighs. Mick notices.

25.

MICK BOYLE
What? Are you still thinking about
Gilda Black?
FRED BALLINGER
No. I’m thinking about the things
you forget over time. I don’t
remember my parents any more. What
they looked like, how they talked.
Last night I was watching Lena as
she slept and I started thinking
about all those little things,
thousands of them, that I did for
her as her father. I did them
deliberately, so that she would
remember them when she grew up. But
in time she won’t remember a single
one.
Mick looks at him but doesn’t know what to say. It’s a
beautiful moment.
Fred meets Mick’s gaze and, with a quickness and vigor that
is unusual for him, he grabs his friend’s arm and hisses
angrily.
FRED BALLINGER (CONT’D)
Tremendous efforts, Mick.
Tremendous efforts, and all for the
most modest results. That’s the way
it always is.
Mick is surprised, stunned even.
MICK BOYLE
This conversation’s getting
interesting. I need a cigarette. I
left mine in the hotel, though.
Wait here, I’m going to go buy
another pack.
Fred nods sadly, as if defeated.
Mick heads off toward the village.
The silence is broken by a cicada singing. Fred turns toward
the sound and, as if in a trance, heads toward it.
CUT TO:
12A. EXT. WOODS. DAY
Fred is in the middle of the woods, where hundreds of cicadas
are singing. Then a strange bird chimes in, making an odd
sound, a sordid chirping that can be heard above the cicadas.
Fred forgets about the cicadas and heads off in search of the
bird, drawn to this new noise.

26.

He stares up at the trees, hoping to see the mysterious bird.
He crosses the woods, is almost at the other side, when a new
constellation of sounds is added to the others: cowbells.
Fred comes out of the woods and is greeted by a sunny, gently
rolling hill. Scattered across it are fifty or so grazing
cows, randomly ringing their bells. Fred’s eyes light up at
the sight. He sits on a rock and stares.
He listens to this superimposition of sounds: cows, bird,
cicadas.
Fred closes his eyes, concentrating now, as the camera slowly
zooms in on him.
Fred begins to move his hand - gently, gracefully, just like
an orchestra director - and, as if by magic, some of the
cowbells fall silent. Others keep ringing, but no longer in
anarchic fashion. Now they play in some clearly melodic
manner. Fred moves his hand again and silences more bells, so
that only two keep ringing, sounding alternate notes. Next
Fred waves his arm behind him, and the bird comes in. Then he
sweeps both arms wide, inviting the chorus to join in:
hundreds of cicadas accompany the bird solo and the cowbell
countermelody. A symphony of nature. Fred’s eyes are still
closed, he is smiling to himself.
The camera has zoomed in to a close-up of Fred’s face. For
the first time, he looks happy.
Mentally selecting the sounds nature offers him, he is doing
something amazing. He is composing.
CUT TO:
12B. EXT. MEADOW. DAY
Mick returns to the spot where he left Fred. He looks around,
but there’s no sign of him. He lights a cigarette.
As he does so, his eye catches something moving behind a
fence in the distance. A white horse.
So Mick does the only thing he knows how to do: he makes a
frame with his hands, the way directors do, to simulate the
viewfinder of a movie camera. He closes one eye and with the
frame of his hands he follows, in a panoramic shot, the
movement of the beautiful white horse.
13. INT./EXT. HOTEL. DAY
A pedestrian bridge leads from the back of the hotel to the
mountains. About a dozen staff - waiters, cooks, and nurses have congregated here, enjoying their break.

27.

They’re all smoking, chatting, horsing around; this is their
time to relax. All except for one girl, who keeps to herself.
She smokes too, but doesn’t talk to anyone. She seems
melancholy. She is leaning over the railing, staring down
below, but without really seeing anything. It’s the masseuse
we saw in Fred's room.
Fred is a hotel hallway, standing at a window that looks out
onto the bridge. His face too is veiled in melancholy as he
stares at the lonely masseuse who smokes and stares.
The sound of that violin, still practicing that same
exercise, catches Fred’s attention. Off he goes, searching
for the source.
14. INT. HOTEL HALLWAY / ROOM. DAY
Fred moves cautiously down the deserted hallway. The violin
can be heard more clearly now. He runs into the sixty-yearold doctor with the kindly face, followed by two nurses. Fred
and the doctor nod in greeting.
Fred comes upon a room, the door open. The chambermaid is
just finishing tidying up, and at the far end, standing in
front of a mirror with a musical score open in front of him,
a twelve-year-old boy is practicing those same two notes,
over and over and over.
The chambermaid leaves, pushing her cleaning cart through the
door.
Fred instinctively steps into the room. He watches the boy
play. The child senses someone’s presence and turns to look
at Fred.
Fred smiles at him. The boy smiles back.
Fred is a little worked up.
FRED BALLINGER
Do you know who composed the piece
you’re practicing?
BOY
No, who?
FRED BALLINGER
Me.
BOY
I don’t believe you. What’s it
called?
FRED BALLINGER
It’s called “Simple Song No.3.”
The boy checks the title on the cover of his score.

28.

BOY
You’re right. And what’s the
composer’s name?
FRED BALLINGER
Fred Ballinger.
BOY
And you, what’s your name?
FRED BALLINGER
Fred Ballinger. You can check at
the front desk. I’m staying here.
The boy is surprised now.
BOY
Incredible.
FRED BALLINGER
Yeah, it is incredible.
BOY
My teacher makes me play it, he
says it’s a perfect piece to start
with.
FRED BALLINGER
He’s right. Because it’s simple.
BOY
But it’s not merely simple.
FRED BALLINGER
It’s not?
BOY
No, it’s also really beautiful.
Fred, cold and impassive, instinctively lets something "hot"
slip.
FRED BALLINGER
Yes, it is beautiful. Because I
composed it when I still loved.
The boy seems not to understand what Fred means, so simply
starts practicing again.
Fred listens for a while, then interrupts him.
FRED BALLINGER (CONT’D)
May I do something while you play?
The boy nods uncertainly.
BOY
(doubtful) Okay.

29.

He starts playing again.
Fred steps timidly into the room and shuffles over to the
boy, who keeps on playing. Fred stretches out his hand and
touches the boy’s arm, the one holding the bow. He raises the
boy’s elbow an inch, correcting his position.
That’s all. Fred is relieved.
FRED BALLINGER
There.
15. INT. HOTEL RESTAURANT. EVENING
The lugubrious silence of the rich as they dine. The only
sound is the tinkling of silverware.
The Russians are there, the black family, and droves of
elderly guests.
Many eyes are irresistibly drawn to the table where the
famous, obese South American dines in silence with his wife.
At another table, a twenty-year-old kid can’t resist the
temptation to take a picture. He discreetly positions his
iPhone. The obese South American, who realizes what the kid
is doing, merely nods wearily to his wife. She understands
immediately, gets up, and goes to get a screen from behind a
column. She places the screen between her husband and the
rest of the room, angling it so as to block the young man’s
view. Then she disappears behind it.
Jimmy Tree is eating alone and has followed the scene that
has just unfolded with utmost concentration.
Another guest is observing the scene too, a giant of a man,
about fifty, with a thick beard, disheveled hair, and dressed
in trekking gear. He looks like a belated hippy. Tucking his
cloth napkin into his shirt, he tackles a bowl of broth.
The obese South American has finished eating, and now crosses
the dining room. He moves with considerable effort, leaning
on his cane and his companion. As he goes by, all the guests
look at him again out the corners of their eyes.
But Jimmy’s attention is still focused on his briarwood cane.
At another table, Fred and Mick.
They obsessively observe a very distinguished, German-looking
couple, around sixty years old: husband and wife are dressed
alike, in brown and beige, clearly not by chance. They both
look incredibly bored and stare into space, not exchanging a
single word.
Fred and Mick chat, but never take their eyes off the silent
couple.

30.

MICK BOYLE
So where did you disappear to
today?
FRED BALLINGER
I got lost following the sounds in
the countryside.
MICK BOYLE
Didn’t you used to get lost in your
music too?
FRED BALLINGER
Everything one hears is music.
Stockhausen. What did you get up
to?
MICK BOYLE
I couldn't find you, so I went to
see my doctor friend. They’re going
to talk tonight, you’ll see.
The married couple still hasn’t said a word.
FRED BALLINGER
Thirty Swiss francs says they won’t
say a word the entire dinner.
MICK BOYLE
I’m so sure they’re going to talk,
I’ll raise you to fifty.
FRED BALLINGER
Done.
The
out
and
the

couple is about to leave. He graciously pulls her chair
for her. She takes his arm. They leave the dining room,
Fred and Mick follow them with their gaze all the way to
door. The couple still doesn’t speak.
FRED BALLINGER (CONT’D)
Including your losses these past
few days, we’re up to 250 Swiss
francs that you owe me.

Fred blows his nose, then rubs the tip four times with his
handkerchief, folds it, and puts it back in his pocket.
Mick Boyle runs his hand over his hair.
Jimmy Tree has been studying their every move from his
solitary table.
16. EXT. HOTEL GARDEN. NIGHT
A swing band is trying to liven up the evening with an upbeat
number that only ends up making people feel sentimental.

31.

Four old men in electric wheelchairs are gathered around a
small table, absorbed in a card game.
A handful of energetic types sway awkwardly on the dance
floor.
A Russian and his wife twirl around in a sweat, as if they
were in a dance competition. He dips her and she laughs.
Jimmy Tree, incongruous in his sunglasses, is in a corner,
chatting with a small group of people, including Mark
Kozelek.
MARK KOZELEK
When did you go to dinner?
JIMMY TREE
Pretty early.
MARK KOZELEK
I would have joined you if you’d
called me.
JIMMY TREE
Just as well. I didn’t just eat at
dinner.
MARK KOZELEK
What else did you do?
JIMMY TREE
I worked.
Mick and Fred, at another table, gaze distractedly at the
gloomy evening.
The upbeat song ends and the band starts in on a slow number.
Couples form.
The eternally mute couple makes its way to the dance floor.
They dance with conviction, but still don’t say a word, don’t
even look at each other. She keeps her inexpressive eyes on
Jimmy Tree. He realizes it, lowers his sunglasses and smiles
courteously at her. She doesn’t return the smile. She doesn’t
react at all. Her husband has followed the whole thing, a
severe, jealous expression on his face.
The hippy mountaineer, sad and solitary, watches the swing
band and sips his herbal tea. It’s so hot it burns his lips.
He lets out a quick but intense groan, which no one hears.
Mick and Fred give in to a brief, tragic exchange.
MICK BOYLE
Today?

32.

FRED BALLINGER
Nothing today. You?
MICK BOYLE
Nothing.
FRED BALLINGER
Let’s hope we can piss tomorrow.
With enormous effort, the obese South American makes his way
to the center of the dance floor, leaning on his cane. He
smiles and holds out his hand, inviting his wife to dance.
She beams and runs to join him. They dance for all of ten
seconds, during which he struggles against his own body, his
legs ruined by his weight. Then he stops, completely
exhausted. His companion grows anxious and gestures for
assistance. Two dutiful waiters carry a chair onto the dance
floor, and the South American collapses in it, as if finally
able to breathe again.
Everyone observes the happenings with a grave air.
Fred and Mick watch as well. Fred blows his nose in his
ritual fashion. Mick, referring to the South American, says:
MICK BOYLE
That man is the last true authentic
myth on the face of the planet.
Like in ancient Greece. If it were
anybody else, we would have laughed
at this little scene. But not him.
No one is laughing. And do you know
why?
FRED BALLINGER
No, why?
MICK BOYLE
Because a myth leaves no room for
the ridiculous.
17. INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. NIGHT
Fred walks down the hallway, away from us. He is overtaken by
an old man in an electric wheelchair. When the man gets to
the far end of the hallway, he crashes into another
wheelchair, which emerges from the hallway to the right. A
minor wheelchair accident. An altercation ensues over matters
of priority, who has the right of way, and what determines
careless driving.
Fred watches the whole thing without batting an eye. He puts
his key in the door and disappears into his room.

33.

18. INT. FRED BALLINGER’S SUITE. NIGHT
Fred is in his room, getting undressed. He’s taking off his
shirt when he hears an inexplicable, muffled lament coming
from the bathroom. He shuffles over to the bathroom door and
opens it. His daughter Lena is sitting on the edge of the
tub, drowning in tears.
It goes without saying that Fred is surprised and, at least
for a second, speechless. Then:
FRED BALLINGER
What are you doing here?
Lena doesn’t answer, she just goes on weeping.
FRED BALLINGER (CONT’D)
Aren’t you supposed to be on a
plane to Polynesia?
She cries some more.
FRED BALLINGER (CONT’D)
Where’s Julian?
Whatever it is she says sounds like the cry of some strange
animal. Impossible to understand. She goes back to crying.
FRED BALLINGER (CONT’D)
Well, aren’t you going to answer
me?
But she doesn’t answer him. She can’t. Because she needs to
cry.
19. INT. MICK BOYLE’S SUITE. NIGHT
Mick Boyle, fully dressed, is lying on his bed, which is
covered in papers and computers, talking merrily on the
phone.
His young screen writers are all pacing the room, eyes
trained on Mick, eager to know the outcome of his phone
conversation.
MICK BOYLE
That’s great, Nick. I’m glad you
like the second draft... Sure,
we’ll work some more on the ending,
we’re not totally happy with it
either... I talked to Brenda.
Everything’s all set... Yes, of
course, she can’t wait. When is she
ever going to get offered a part
like this again, at her age!...
Yeah, I know she’s capricious, but
she behaves with me.
(MORE)

34.
MICK BOYLE (CONT'D)
She always says I’m the best when
it comes to actresses, that I’m the
only one in the world who knows how
to direct her. So, if it’s okay
with you, I’d like to start
scouting out locations next
month... perfect. Great... yeah,
bye.

The screenwriters, pleased with what they hear, grin and pat
each other on the back.
Mick puts down the phone and looks up.
Only now do we discover the presence of Fred Ballinger
sitting impassively in a chair.
MICK BOYLE (CONT’D)
What happened to you? You look like
you just came from a funeral.
FRED BALLINGER
Your son left my daughter.
FEMALE SCREENWRITER
Fuck!
MICK BOYLE
What do you mean?
FRED BALLINGER
They were boarding the plane for
Polynesia, and right there in the
tunnel he stops and tells her he’s
fallen in love with another woman.
MICK BOYLE
Nothing like being in a tunnel to
make you feel you're in a tunnel.
FRED BALLINGER
(ironic) How profound! You're quite
the magician of metaphor.
The screenwriters snigger.
MICK BOYLE
And then he took this other woman
on vacation?
FRED BALLINGER
It seems he at least had the good
taste not to do that. At least not
yet.
MICK BOYLE
And Lena?

35.

FRED BALLINGER
Lena’s in my room, crying her eyes
out. I’ve never seen anybody cry so
much my whole life. I didn’t think
it was possible to cry that much.
MICK BOYLE
I read in some magazine once that
tear ducts can produce tears for
three days without stopping.
SHY SCREENWRITER
I heard that too, but on a BBC
documentary.
INTELLECTUAL SCREENWRITER
He’s on his deathbed, and he says
to her, "Let's watch one last BBC
documentary together, darling."
FRED BALLINGER
Knock it off, guys.
MICK BOYLE
I don’t know if it’s true, though,
this thing about the tear ducts. It
was in one of those popular
magazines, they have a tendency to
exaggerate, you know, better for
sales.
FRED BALLINGER
I think we’re getting off track.
MICK BOYLE
I think you’re right. Julian’s such
a shit. Just like his mother.
Remember? I idolized her, but she
was busy idolizing electricians and
grips.
FRED BALLINGER
She idolized everyone, Mick.
FEMALE SCREENWRITER
(smiling) Ecumenicalism is a noble
ideal.
MICK BOYLE
(with staged anger)
Ecumenicalism??? My best friend is
telling me that my ex-wife was
sleeping with everyone, and all
these years he never said a word!
Do you get how serious this is?

36.

FRED BALLINGER
And you never told me about Gilda
Black.
MICK BOYLE
Ok, I get it. Now that you’ve had
your little revenge, can we be
serious? I’m going to call that
shithead son of mine.
Mick grabs the phone again and dials.
FRED BALLINGER
What are you going to do? You
really think you can convince him
to get back together with Lena?
It’s hopeless.
MICK BOYLE
No, but I want to at least know
what happened.
His son must have said “hello” on the other end of the line,
because Mick starts in on him, his tone severe.
MICK BOYLE (CONT’D)
Julian, this is your father, even
though at this point, based on the
evidence, I’m not so sure you are
my son.
The intellectual screenwriter gestures to the shy one to take
notes.
INTELLECTUAL SCREENWRITER
Take notes. We can use this in the
film.
20. INT. DINING ROOM. HOTEL. DAY
It’s late for breakfast. Some of the waiters are already
setting up for lunch.
The only guests at this hour are the eternally silent couple.
They finish their breakfast, then get up and leave,
maintaining their strict silence the whole while.
Mick and Fred follow them with their eyes, and when they
disappear from view, Mick, with a mechanical gesture, hands
Fred fifty Swiss francs.
MICK BOYLE
How are you always so sure they’re
not going to speak?

37.

FRED BALLINGER
Because I know something about
them, the waiter told me.
MICK BOYLE
What?
FRED BALLINGER
I can’t tell you, it’s my advantage
over you.
MICK BOYLE
Tell me right this minute. Besides,
I can always get the waiter to tell
me too, a little bribe... I’ve
thrown so much money away over this
story already...
FRED BALLINGER
Alright then, I’ll tell you:
they’re mute.
Mick starts.
MICK BOYLE
You little shit! Give me back my
money, all of it. You’re a cheat.
All bets are off.
FRED BALLINGER
You are so gullible! I was joking,
Mick, they’re not mute.
Their conversation is interrupted by a silent apparition at
the far end of the dining room: a forty-year-old man,
impeccably dressed in jacket and tie, followed by a plump
woman who is, by all appearances, his secretary, an anonymouslooking woman of about forty, unkempt, hair pulled back any
old way, no makeup, decent but inexpensive clothes.
Mick and Fred glare at the man who makes his way toward them.
Without even looking at her, he hands his secretary his cell
phone, and she slips it into a men’s leather briefcase.
They cross the dining room together. The man stops at Fred
and Mick’s table. The secretary keeps a few feet back and
starts fiddling with her phone, checking e-mails.
Mick looks at the man. By now it’s clear that this is his son
Julian. Stunningly handsome, classic good looks, perfect.
Confident and proud, Julian holds his father’s gaze. Fred’s
eyes ping-pong from one to the other.
MICK BOYLE
What the hell is going on?

38.

JULIAN
It’s really rather banal, dad. I
fell in love with another woman.
MICK BOYLE
Who’s all of eighteen, right?
JULIAN
No dad, she’s not eighteen. She’s
thirty. A reasonable age.
MICK BOYLE
Well, however old she is, you’ve
really fucked up.
JULIAN
That’s your opinion.
MICK BOYLE
Yes, that is my opinion. Lena is an
extraordinary woman. At this point
I realize, of course, that she’s
wasted on you. She’s far too
intelligent for you.
JULIAN
Perhaps. But why did you make me
come? I’m not about to change my
mind.
MICK BOYLE
That’s what everyone says, at
first. Then they end up begging
their spouse to take them back. I
can’t tell you how many times I’ve
seen it...
JULIAN
Mom left you and she never begged
you to take her back.
MICK BOYLE
(to Fred) What did I tell you? You
see now where he gets it from, this
asshole?
JULIAN
So in your opinion, a man’s an
asshole because, even if he didn’t
want to, even if he tried like
crazy to stay with his wife, even
if he booked them a dream vacation,
he realizes he just can’t go
through with it because he has
fallen hopelessly in love with
another woman?

39.

MICK BOYLE
Just like your mother!
Melodramatic, hyperbolic, and
completely idiotic.
JULIAN
Thanks, Dad.
MICK BOYLE
(explodes) Well then, are we
allowed to know who this whore
you’ve fallen in love with is?
WOMAN’S VOICE
Me.
Fred and Mick go white. They lean forward. We’d nearly
forgotten about the nondescript secretary standing behind
Julian, but it was she who spoke. She takes a step forward
and reaffirms in a dignified manner:
SECRETARY
I am the woman Julian has lost his
head for. We’re getting married as
soon as his divorce is finalized.
JULIAN
Precisely.
Fred’s and Mick’s jaws drop. Stunned in disbelief, they just
gape at her, at a loss for words.
The woman stands close to Julian. They put their arms around
each other. He is gorgeous, as handsome as George Clooney.
She just the opposite.
MICK BOYLE
And who the fuck are you?
SECRETARY
My name is Paloma Faith. And I’m
not a whore. I’m a singer.
JULIAN
(proud) We work together. I'm
producing her next album.
Mick recovers a grain of sense and says:
MICK BOYLE
Excuse me, Miss, but could you
leave us alone for a moment? My
son’s father-in-law and I need to
have a word in private with Julian.

40.

PALOMA FAITH
Okay, but not for long. We can't
stand being apart from each other
for more than five minutes.
MICK BOYLE
Very kind of you, dear, but don't
worry, I'll only need a minute to
fathom my son's psychology.
The woman walks away, her gait ackward and ungainly.
Fred and Mick follow her with their eyes and wait until she
has left the dining room before they turn to meet Julian’s
proud, impassive gaze.
Mick seems sincere now. He truly wants to fathom the mystery
of the human condition.
MICK BOYLE (CONT’D)
Forgive me, Julian, but I’m trying
to understand. It may be banal, and
maybe I’m too old to understand,
but you have to explain something
to me: Lena is a beautiful woman, a
dream. And this one here is the
most insignificant woman on the
face of the planet. In short, I
mean, but you, what the fuck do you
see in her?
Julian is ill at ease for the first time. He sighs, looks
away.
JULIAN
You really want to know?
MICK BOYLE
Yes, Julian, I really want to know.
Julian takes his time. He checks to make sure his secretary
is not in the room, then turns and looks at his father and
says all in one breath:
JULIAN
She’s really good in bed.
Mick and Fred are really at a loss for words now.
21. EXT. COUNTRY LANE. DAY
Fred and Lena walk through that beautiful valley.
Proud and serious, she stares into the distance.

41.

He is ill at ease and doesn’t know what to say. He’s
distracted by the sound of a bird that suddenly starts to
sing when Lena calls him back to reality.
LENA
So who is this bitch?
FRED BALLINGER
Somebody by the name of Paloma
Faith.
LENA
And what does she do?
FRED BALLINGER
The most obscene thing in the
world.
LENA
She’s a prostitute?
FRED BALLINGER
Worse. She’s a pop star.
LENA
And what did Julian say?
FRED BALLINGER
I already told you.
LENA
Not really. All you did was babble
incomprehensibly.
FRED BALLINGER
Julian was the one who was
babbling. He’s not all there in the
head.
LENA
It doesn’t seem that way to me. He
must have made twenty decisions in
two hours. He moved out. He rented
an apartment. He spoke with a
divorce lawyer. That doesn’t seem
like a confused man to me. You keep
telling me this woman is ugly and
insignificant, so what does he see
in her that he didn’t in me?
FRED BALLINGER
How should I know?
LENA
You told me Mick asked him.
FRED BALLINGER
Did I?

42.

LENA
Yes, that’s what you said. So what
was Julian’s response?
FRED BALLINGER
You know, Lena, I don’t remember.
LENA
You’re really pissing me off,
daddy. You remember perfectly well,
and you’re hopeless at telling
lies. What did he say?
FRED BALLINGER
I really don’t remember, I swear.
He must have mumbled something
idiotic.
LENA
If you don’t tell me, I swear I’ll
scream right here and now. What did
he say? What the fuck does this
woman have - at least according to
Julian - that I don’t? I want to
know what he said! I want to know.
Fred stops. He can’t stand it any more. He sighs deeply. And
decides to tell her what she wants to know.
FRED BALLINGER
He said she’s good in bed.
Lena turns to stone. Her face tightens, sours nastily. With a
savage coldness, she says to her father.
LENA
You didn’t have to tell me.
And she storms off, leaving her father alone in the middle of
the valley as the two notes the little boy had played return,
not on a violin now, but on a gloomy double bass.
21A. INT. WELLNESS CENTER (VARIOUS SETTINGS). DAY
21A/1
Those two gloomy notes hover in the steam of the Turkish
baths and saunas, where backlit, naked bodies of all ages
look lifeless, abandoned to the heat and sweat.
Toned, gleaming bodies, ample, round bodies, old, worn-out
bodies. This is the work of wellness. This is how some people
try to prolong the future or awkwardly pursue a youthful
past.
21A/2 21A/3
And then, more bodies, eyes closed, buried in tubs, wrapped
in herbs and mud. Like living meadows.

43.

Motionless still lifes, while the double bass plays
discreetly, without ever moving away from those two simple
notes.
22. INT. MASSAGE ROOM. DAY
Candles, incense, shadows.
And the two double bass notes, to which is now added a slight
variation.
Fred and Lena are lying on their backs on marble benches.
Naked, but completely covered in dark mud.
They look like they’ve been petrified in some volcanic
eruption. Their eyes are the only part of them not covered in
mud. They stare lifelessly at the ceiling, on which a soft
and hypnotic light plays.
Fred, rather awkwardly, is trying to be fatherly.
FRED BALLINGER
Believe me, Lena, I can understand
you, really, I can.
Silence. Lena doesn’t respond. But when she does, she is
lucid, furious, and ruthless.
LENA
You can understand me, Daddy? Like
hell you can! Mummy would have been
able to understand me. Mummy found
herself with you in the same
situation I’m in now, not once but
dozens of times. And she always
pretended not to know. You had a
stream of women, but she just kept
going. Not just for us children,
but also, above all, for you. She
loved you and so she forgave you.
No matter what happened, she still
wanted to be with you. But who were
you? Who? That’s what I always
asked myself. You never gave
anything, not to her, not to me,
nothing. You gave everything to
your music. Music, music, music!
There was nothing else in your
life. Only music. And aridness.
Never a caress, never a hug, a
kiss, nothing. You never knew
anything about your children. You
never knew if we were suffering, if
we were happy. Nothing. Everything
was on mummy’s shoulders.
(MORE)

44.
LENA (CONT'D)
At home, all you’d ever say to her
were two words: “Quiet, Melanie.”
And mummy would explain to us,
“Quiet, daddy’s composing,” “Quiet,
daddy’s resting, he has a concert
tonight,” “Quiet, daddy is talking
on the phone with someone
important.” “Quiet, daddy has
Stravinsky coming to the house
today.” You wanted to be
Stravinsky, but you didn't have a
single drop of his genius.
"Quiet, Melanie!", was all you knew
how to say.
You never knew the first thing
about my mother!
You never bothered to take care of
her. And even now, you haven’t
brought her flowers for ten years.
And then that letter! You think
mummy never read it? Well, you’re
wrong. She found it and she read
it. And I read it too. You probably
don’t even remember that letter,
but we do. The letter in which you
declared your love for another man.
Mummy had to endure that
humiliation too. “My necessary
experimentation in sexual matters,”
as you put it. So your musical
experimentation wasn’t enough for
you, you had to experiment with
homosexuality too! And you didn’t
give a fuck about all the anguish
you caused her. So don’t come
telling me that you can understand,
because you don’t understand a
fucking thing.

She’s done. Silence. Fred doesn’t say a word. They just lie
there, buried in mud, staring at the ceiling.
The double bass notes are done as well.
23. INT. HOTEL GYM. DAY
One entire wall is set up for free climbing.
The hippy mountaineer is at the top of the wall, thirty feet
up, hanging by one hand, dangling in the air without a safety
rope, with an admirable casualness.
He addresses that pale, thirteen-year-old girl we saw
earlier. She stands down below, near the base of the wall.
She hasn’t even climbed an inch. The mountaineer speaks
sweetly from up above.

45.

MOUNTAINEER
Come on, Frances, give it a try.
The girl looks up at him but doesn’t say a word. She’s still
biting her nails.
MOUNTAINEER (CONT’D)
Wouldn’t you like to come see what
the world looks like from up here?
The girl looks at him and nods.
MOUNTAINEER (CONT’D)
Good, now give it a go.
The girl shakes her head no.
MOUNTAINEER (CONT’D)
Ok, wait there.
In three swift moves, the mountaineer is back at her side.
MOUNTAINEER (CONT’D)
Climb on my shoulders.
The girl gets onto his huge shoulders. He starts climbing
confidently, easily, as if he were carrying a knapsack
instead of a human being.
MOUNTAINEER (CONT’D)
Ok, now, as we climb, look down.
See how beautiful the world is from
up here?
The girl, clinging to his shoulders, turns and looks down.
And from high up on the wall she spots someone standing at
the door to the gym, looking up at them. It’s Lena.
So the girl “knocks” on the mountaineer’s shoulder, inviting
him to turn. He looks down, but Lena’s not there. She has
already disappeared.
24. EXT./INT. HOTEL GARDEN/MASSEUSE’S ROOM. DAY
We’re in a different garden now, more isolated, further away
from the hotel, one that abuts the building where the staff
lives. Guests never come here. The main hotel seems far away.
In the center of the garden are abundant rose bushes,
fountains, even a fake little stream. All laid out - rather
clumsily - to resemble a lush, lyrical garden of Eden.
As we said, there’s no one here. No, wait - there’s Fred.
He’s sitting on a bench staring at the fake little stream,
sucking on a candy. His eyes are so laden with melancholy it
would be impossible for them to look any sadder. He seems
dazed, absent, lost in thought.

46.

All of a sudden he rouses himself. He blows his nose, quickly
rubs the tip four times with his handkerchief, folds it, and
puts it back in his pocket.
As he puts his handkerchief away, his eye is drawn to
something in a ground-floor window: his tiny, timid masseuse,
in shorts and a T-shirt, is dancing, moving gracefully in
front of a TV. She’s playing a Kinect game. A stylized female
figurine on the TV screen demonstrates the moves for her.
It’s marvelous and moving to see this petite girl dance. And
with such incongruous intensity. She’s all sweaty, her hair
plastered to her forehead and temples.
Fred watches her while his hand instinctively, rhythmically
rubs a candy wrapper.
Fred doesn’t notice that there’s another man there, behind
him, wrapped in a white robe. He’s watching the girl dance
too. It’s Jimmy Tree, the American actor.
25. INT. HOTEL RESTAURANT. EVENING
Lots of people at dinner. Still that cavernous silence.
Fred and Mick stare at the silent German couple, in matching
tonalities today too, a blue theme this time.
Lena enters the dining room. She has abandoned her simple,
sober look and is wearing a highly provocative dress and has
a new, very flattering hairstyle.
A wave of nostalgia floods Mick’s heart.
MICK BOYLE
You remind me of Brenda Morel when
she was thirty. When she made "At
James' house" with me. You should
dress this way all the time, Lena.
LENA
From now on that's exactly what I’m
going to do.
Fred follows Lena with her eyes, but she deliberately avoids
looking at him and takes her seat at the table.
The mountaineer, seated at another table, can’t help but
notice how beautiful Lena is. His eyes light up, but then
grow dull again, as if he’s been defeated even before he
begins. Dejected, he puts down his spoon and stops eating.
Mark Kozelek and his other friends have joined Jimmy at his
table. They’re all talking, in groups of two, all except for
Jimmy. He’s fixated on the mountaineer and Lena, and doesn’t
miss a thing of what is unfolding between them.

47.

Then, all of a sudden, something unbelievable happens.
The German woman gets up calmly and slaps her husband so hard
he nearly falls out of his chair.
It goes without saying that everyone turns and gapes in
astonishment.
The woman walks out of the dining room in the most dignified
manner imaginable.
Mick’s, Fred’s and Lena’s jaws drop. Stunned, they follow the
whole thing.
Everyone at Jimmy Tree's table starts snickering. All but
Jimmy, that is. He too follows the scene open-mouthed.
The slapped husband seems indifferent to their stares. He
simply returns to his meal, calmly eating his cream of
mushroom soup.
The obese South American, supported by his wife, gets up from
his table and slowly makes his way toward the dining room
door. But when he gets to the table of the slapped husband,
he stops. The elderly German lifts his eyes to the obese
South American, who does two things: first he smiles
slightly, and then he caresses the German’s cheek with his
pudgy hand. The elderly man looks at him gratefully, and
tries to return the smile. The South American walks away amid
the deadly silence that has descended over the room.
The camera finds Jimmy Tree. He has followed everything,
naturally, and is really moved.
26. EXT. HOTEL GARDEN. NIGHT
One of those little stages has been set up in the garden,
opposite the pool. A local singer - an elegant woman, about
fifty years old - is performing, accompanied by three
musicians.
The hotel guests are scattered about on lawn furniture,
enjoying the beautiful concert.
Fred, Mick, and Lena are at one table, listening to the
singer’s splendid rendition of “Lili Marleen.”
Jimmy Tree stands and listens too, completely enraptured. A
serious, concentrated look on his face, he whispers the
German lyrics, which he knows by heart.
Then he senses a presence to his left. Jimmy turns. The
silent German woman is looking at him, her hand extended, as
if inviting him to dance. He smiles at her and steps closer.
They begin to dance slowly.

48.

The German woman’s husband, sitting at a table, is a bundle
of anger, he is devoured by jealousy.
Fred and Mick are dying of curiosity. They stare at Jimmy and
the woman as they dance.
Jimmy murmurs something in her ear, not trying to be
seductive though.
JIMMY TREE
What lovely perfume you’re
wearing... What is it?
Mick and Fred wait for the woman to speak.
The German woman, embarrassed, doesn’t respond, but holds him
a little tighter. Jimmy holds her tighter too and, as he
dances, he lets himself go, closing his eyes.
From their table, Kozelek and his friends stare intently at
Jimmy.
The hippy mountaineer pretends rather awkwardly that he just
happens to be passing by, but it’s clear that he is taking a
tortuous path in order to look at Lena. She doesn’t even
notice him. He is so overcome with emotion that, despite
being an expert climber, he trips on a table leg, but doesn’t
fall.
“Lili Marleen” is over. The German woman smiles at Jimmy and
he smiles back. They move apart.
She returns to her husband’s table. He glares ferociously at
her. She feels his eyes on her but avoids his gaze.
Jimmy approaches Fred carrying a herbal tea. He sits down
next to him. Their smiles convey a shared warmth.
FRED BALLINGER
Is that straight herbal tea or is
it mixed with a gin and tonic?
JIMMY TREE
Straight tea. I'm trying to be
good.
Fred smiles.
FRED BALLINGER
Too bad!
He blows his nose in his usual manner. Jimmy observes him.
FRED BALLINGER (CONT’D)
How’s the work on your character
going?

49.

JIMMY TREE
So so... pretty well, actually.
I’ve come up with some interesting
details.
FRED BALLINGER
Good.
JIMMY TREE
This morning, that girl dancing all
by herself. I saw her too. It
was... it was....
FRED BALLINGER
... unforgettable.
JIMMY TREE
Yes. That’s exactly the word:
unforgettable.
Jimmy finishes his herbal tea and takes his leave with a
playful military salute. Fred smiles at him. But Lena wipes
the smile off his face when she says.
LENA
Maybe the problem is that Julian
and I never had children.
Fred turns and looks at her. Serious now.
FRED BALLINGER
I don’t know what the problem is.
I’m not going to try and cheer you
up by telling you lies or talking
about things I’ve never understood.
You’re right: all I understand is
music. And do you know why? Because
music doesn’t need words or
experience to be understood. It
just is. Your mother would have
understood you. I can’t.
But your mother's not here.
They look at each other without saying another word.
26A. INT. HOTEL RESTAURANT. NIGHT
The elegant woman who sang "Lili Marleen" is the only person
in the otherwise deserted restaurant. Wearing an evening gown
and showing us her ancient and noble profile, she is sitting
at one of the tables. Eyes lowered, with the concentration of
a starving animal, she devours a chicken leg with her hands.
Suddenly she stops eating and looks up, gazing vacantly into
space. A fixed, sterile stare. At that very moment a verse
she had sung from "Lili Marleen" echoes in her head, a
cappella. She lowers her eyes to the chicken leg and the song
stops. She starts eating again, as voracious as before.

50.

26B. EXT. HOTEL GARDEN. NIGHT
It’s late. The garden where the little concerts are held is
deserted. Only Fred Ballinger is still there. He has fallen
asleep in a chair, as in the opening scene of the film. The
lights are low and the wind is blowing. Fred opens his eyes
and sees that a dozen rocking chairs, scattered around the
garden, are moving in unison in the wind. Everything else is
still.
26C. INT. HOTEL LOBBY. NIGHT
The deserted lobby. Only one person is there, sitting on a
couch: the young and eternally ungainly hooker.
Mick Boyle crosses the deserted lobby on the way to his room.
His eyes fall on the chubby girl.
She gives him an awkward but alluring, knowing look.
He smiles at her, but with the smile of a father, which seems
like a tender refusal. He walks away.
The girl looks sad and serious again.
But after a few steps Mick stops, as if he’s had second
thoughts.
The girl realizes this, but she deliberately keeps from
looking at him again.
Mick turns and observes her from afar. He is serious. And
tempted. He reflects. He stares at the girl.
She decides to look at him now, but it’s too late: Mick is
already gone.
27. INT. FRED BALLINGER’S SUITE. NIGHT
Fred and Lena are asleep in the double bed.
Then, through the windows, a theatrical light slowly comes
on, illuminating ten women on the balcony, all dressed in
black. Somber, immobile.
Slowly, slowly, the violin starts up again, playing those
same first notes of “Simple Song No.3.”
The women on the balcony join in with the violin and begin to
sing in the most splendid soprano voices.
Fred opens his eyes and says.
FRED BALLINGER
Enough.

51.

Then, all of a sudden, as if he were possessed, he throws off
the covers and hurls himself at the window.
But there’s no one there. The balcony is empty and dark. Fred
shouts and punches the glass.
FRED BALLINGER (CONT’D)
Enough! Stop singing, now! Enough!
Lena wakes up with a start. She is worried.
LENA
Daddy, stop, that’s enough! You
were dreaming.
Fred composes himself. He stops shouting, but still clings to
the glass, in a daze. Lena looks behind him, now she’s the
one who doesn’t know what to say.
28. EXT. COUNTRY LANE. DAY
Parachutists twirl gracefully, silently just below the craggy
mountain peaks.
Fred and Mick are taking a walk.
Out of nowhere, a little dramatically, as if choosing a topic
at random, Fred says.
FRED BALLINGER
This morning I took a long,
powerful piss. And while I was
doing it, I was thinking, Jesus,
when is this going to stop? When? I
just kept pissing and pissing. And
I was so happy! I haven’t been that
happy in months.
Mick hides his displeasure.
MICK BOYLE
Good, I’m happy for you.
But Fred realizes his friend is upset.
FRED BALLINGER
I was joking, Mick. It didn’t
happen like that.
MICK BOYLE
Don’t joke about these things,
Fred. Prostate is serious.
FRED BALLINGER
You always fall for my jokes.
You’ve been believing every word I
say for the last sixty years.

52.

MICK BOYLE
I invent stories, Fred. I have to
believe everything in order to make
things up. Do you remember the
other day? When you told me you
don’t remember your parents any
more?
FRED BALLINGER
No, I don’t remember.
MICK BOYLE
Of course you do. Well, you made me
realize that not only do I not
remember my parents, but my
childhood, for example, I don’t
remember a thing about it. There’s
only one thing I still remember.
FRED BALLINGER
What’s that?
MICK BOYLE
The precise moment when I learned
to ride a bicycle. I know it sounds
banal, but oh, what joy! It was
sheer joy. And this morning, as if
by magic, for the first time, I
also remembered the moment right
after I learned to ride a bike.
FRED BALLINGER
The moment in which you fell.
MICK BOYLE
How the fuck did you know?
FRED BALLINGER
Because that’s how it was for
everyone, Mick. You learn to do
something, you’re really happy, and
then you forget to brake.
MICK BOYLE
Isn’t that a terrific metaphor for
life?
FRED BALLINGER
Let’s not go rushing to
conclusions, Mick.
And then something amazing happens. A boy, about eleven years
old, comes toward them on the country lane. He’s riding a
mountain bike, and, with astonishing self-confidence, is
doing a wheelie. Mick and Fred watch him, speechless. The boy
peddles past them, still up on one wheel. He races all the
way to the end of the lane, as silent as a ghost, balanced on
one wheel.

53.

Mick and Fred turn to watch him, ecstatic.
Fred thinks for a minute, then says:
FRED BALLINGER (CONT’D)
You know something, Mick?
MICK BOYLE
What?
FRED BALLINGER
You and me, we’re never going to
die.
Mick turns to his friend. He smiles and then adds:
MICK BOYLE
Now let’s not go rushing to
conclusions, Fred!
But then something catches his attention: the silent German
couple, dressed in matching green, is about to enter the
dense woods. Mick gestures to Fred, who turns and sees them
too, right as they disappear among the trees. Fred doesn’t
need to think twice. He turns to Mick and in a serious voice
says:
FRED BALLINGER
Let’s follow them.
29. EXT. WOODS. DAY
Fred and Mick crouch behind some bushes, perfectly still.
Watching. And what do they see?
They see the silent German couple leaning against a tree,
their clothes half off. He is penetrating her with a passion
worthy of an teenage boy dying to screw.
They are really enjoying it. He is in a frenzy, she’s about
to climax. They come, both of them, together. The myth of the
simultaneous orgasm, right there in the woods. They moan with
pleasure.
So in their own way, they have spoken.
Impassive, Fred merely takes out his wallet and hands Mick
fifty Swiss francs.
30. INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. DAY
Fred walks down the hallway. Lena is waiting for him at the
door to their suite. She seems restless, short of breath,
anxious to talk with her father. In fact, she says to him
right away.

54.

LENA
Where have you been, daddy? This
man’s been here for an hour, he
says he’s Queen Elizabeth’s
emissary.
Fred snorts, as if this was the last thing he wanted to hear.
LENA (CONT’D)
I told him to make himself
comfortable in the living room.
31. INT. FRED BALLINGER’S SUITE. DAY
Lena pours a coffee for the Queen’s emissary, whom we met
earlier. He and Fred sit facing each other, one on a love
seat, the other in an easy chair, a small table between them.
Lena goes and sits on a chair behind her father.
The emissary nervously taps his pants’ pocket, where we can
see clearly the bulge of a packet of cigarettes. Fred notices
his agitation.
FRED BALLINGER
You can smoke here, if you want.
The emissary can’t believe his ears. He’s as astounded as if
there’d just been an earthquake.
QUEEN’S EMISSARY
Are you serious?
FRED BALLINGER
The hotel manager is a music lover.
So he grants me some small
privileges.
The emissary’s smile is one of infinite gratitude.
QUEEN’S EMISSARY
You have no idea how much pleasure
this gives me.
FRED BALLINGER
Are you feeling tense?
QUEEN’S EMISSARY
I’ll say.
He says, taking a deep, restorative drag on his cigarette.
FRED BALLINGER
There’s no ashtray, though.
QUEEN’S EMISSARY
That’s fine, I’ll cope.

55.

FRED BALLINGER
I don’t have much time, so let’s
skip the formalities. I have to do
a thorough cleansing of my
intestines soon.
The emissary’s expression instinctively looks pained and
says.
QUEEN’S EMISSARY
Will it hurt?
FRED BALLINGER
No, it's just embarrassing.
The emissary sighs and starts in.
QUEEN’S EMISSARY
I wasn’t able to convince the
Queen. I relayed your reticence
about the songs to her. I proposed
an alternative repertoire. An
alternative musician. An
alternative sort of evening. She
doesn’t want alternatives. She
wants you and only you and only
your “Simple Songs.” She says it’s
all that Prince Philip listens to.
FRED BALLINGER
I’m sorry. I don’t want to seem
rude. But I’m afraid it’s
impossible.
QUEEN’S EMISSARY
But why?
FRED BALLINGER
I explained why, the last time we
met. Personal reasons.
QUEEN’S EMISSARY
And is there no way to resolve
these personal reasons?
FRED BALLINGER
Unfortunately not.
QUEEN’S EMISSARY
I’m begging you, Maestro. I have a
difficult job. I simply must return
to London with a positive answer.
FRED BALLINGER
But my answer is negative.
Lena follows every word.

56.

QUEEN’S EMISSARY
I simply don’t understand. What is
it that doesn’t work? The date? The
location? The orchestra? The
soprano? The Queen?
FRED BALLINGER
Please, don’t insist. Personal
reasons.
The emissary drops his diplomatic demeanor and shows a flash
of anger.
QUEEN’S EMISSARY
And what exactly are these bloody
personal reasons?
Fred doesn’t respond.
Lena is beginning to understand. We’re not, but she is. She
starts to cry quietly, inwardly.
FRED BALLINGER
Personal means that I’m not obliged
to explain them.
QUEEN’S EMISSARY
Let’s see if we can resolve these
personal problems then. What is it
that is wrong?
FRED BALLINGER
(at random) The soprano.
The emissary beams. He thinks they have arrived at a
solution.
QUEEN’S EMISSARY
We’ll get a different one, then, no
problem.
FRED BALLINGER
It wouldn’t make any difference.
QUEEN’S EMISSARY
Even though Sumi Jo is the absolute
best, and she has already expressed
her enthusiasm at being directed by
you. She’s ecstatic! In seventh
heaven!
FRED BALLINGER
I’m not interested.
QUEEN’S EMISSARY
What is it you have against her?

FRED BALLINGER
Nothing! I don’t even know her.
QUEEN’S EMISSARY
And so?!
Fred loses his patience for the first time. He raises his
voice, practically shouts.
FRED BALLINGER
So enough already!
Lena cries more openly now, her eyes brimming with tears.
She tries to hide them, but she can’t.
The emissary notices Lena’s tears and is dumbfounded. He’s
trying to understand, but doesn’t know what to say. He throws
open his arms in defeat.
QUEEN’S EMISSARY
I just do not understand. What
exactly is the problem?
Fred shouts at him again. His words come tumbling out,
unplanned.
FRED BALLINGER
The problem is that those Simple
Songs were composed for my wife.
And only my wife performed them,
only my wife recorded them. And as
long as I live, my wife will be the
only one to sing them. The problem,
my dear sir, is that my wife can’t
sing any more. Now do you
understand? Do you?
Lena has buried her face in her hands, trying to stifle her
sobs.
Fred is beside himself. He looks exhausted, drained.
The emissary is struck dumb. He gets to his feet and stubs
out his cigarette in the pack. He is deeply dismayed.
QUEEN’S EMISSARY
Yes, I do understand now, and I beg
your pardon. Maestro.
He walks quickly to the door.
Fred and Lena just sit there, he staring into space and she
weeping behind him.

58.

31A. INT/EXT. CORRIDOR + HOTEL BRIDGE. DAY.
31A/1
In close-up, the bells in the corridors trill merrily.
31A/2
On the bridge where the staff goes to smoke, they all put out
their cigarettes and, like a flock of sheep, head back inside
the hotel to work.
32. INT. MASSAGE ROOM. DAY
The young masseuse is rubbing oil on her hands.
Fred Ballinger, lying on his stomach on the massage table,
his head stuck in the hole, looks down at the floor, right at
the girl’s tiny sandals.
The masseuse places her hands gently on Fred’s naked back.
She begins massaging him, but stops after a minute.
MASSEUSE
I’m going to give you a different
type of massage, because you are
stressed. No, to be precise, you’re
not stressed, you’re emotional.
FRED BALLINGER
You understand everything with your
hands.
MASSEUSE
We can understand all sorts of
things by touching. Who knows why
people are so afraid of touching.
FRED BALLINGER
Maybe because they think it has
something to do with pleasure.
MASSEUSE
Which is another good reason for
touching instead of talking.
Fred is silent. He stares at the floor for a while. Then he
says:
FRED BALLINGER
Don’t you like to talk?
MASSEUSE
(frank) I never have anything to
say.
FRED BALLINGER
We forget sometimes, but sincerity
is beautiful, isn’t it?

59.

But the masseuse has changed the kind of massage she is
doing. She has nothing more to say, so she doesn’t say
anything.
Fred relaxes and closes his eyes.
33. EXT. MOUNTAIN PEAK. DAY
Mick and his young screenwriters are climbing up a steep
mountain path.
They meet a young family coming down the mountain. The father
is wearing a toddler backpack carrier, in which his threeyear-old son is sleeping peacefully. Mick looks at the
sleeping child.
Dressed for trekking, Mick and his young screenwriters are
ascending an impassable mountain trail. They reach the summit
- what a view! We can sense that suspended silence, the
clean, crisp air, and appreciate the magnificent panorama of
the mountains and the valley below.
There is a telescope at the lookout point, one of those
tourist ones you have to put a coin in to make it work.
They admire the panorama in silence. Mick breaks away from
the group and puts a coin in the telescope. Then he calls his
young screenwriters over.
MICK BOYLE
Come look.
The girl goes first. She peers into the telescope. Mick
instructs her as the others listen in.
MICK BOYLE (CONT’D)
Now listen. Do you see that
mountain over there?
GIRL
Yeah, it seems really close.
MICK BOYLE
Exactly. That’s what you see when
you’re young. Everything seems
really close. That’s the future.
Now come with me.
She takes the girl by the hand and invites her to look
through the telescope from the other direction.
The girl looks from the other side and sees the faces of her
friends. They look really far away even though they’re only
six feet away from her.

60.

MICK BOYLE (CONT’D)
And this is what you see when
you’re old. Everything seems really
far away. That’s the past.
The girl looking in the telescope is moved. He’s too far away
in the inverted lens, so she can’t see that the boy she’s
always fighting with is moved as well.
They’re all at a loss for words.
Mick crouches over a knapsack and pulls out a bottle of
spumante and some plastic cups, talking all the while.
MICK BOYLE (CONT’D)
When I was young, I used to say to
myself: if I grow old I’m not going
to make the same mistake all old
people make, I’m not going to
become boring and pedantic. But
that’s exactly what I have become.
So, forgive me.
Now for the serious stuff: Brenda
can’t wait to get started. And I am
so proud of having written this
screenplay with you. I have to
confess something. I’ve made twenty
films, but they’re all irrelevant.
This is the only film that means
anything to me. This film has...
yes, well, it’s my sentimental,
intellectual, and moral testament.
This film is the only thing that
matters to me. Nothing else. And
so, let’s toast to the completion
of the third draft of “Life’s Last
Day.”
SCREENWRITER 1
What about the ending, Mick?
MICK BOYLE
The ending... We’ll come up with
one, sooner or later. Cheers.
33A. EXT. GARDEN WITH CANOPY. DAY
The beautiful garden with its centuries-old trees and
canopied paths is deserted until a stocky, big-bellied man,
completely covered in mud, appears. He looks like a statue
that has turned out wrong. He’s clutching a cell phone,
yelling in Italian with a heavy Neapolitan accent.
MUD MAN
You gotta realize, baby, you're
asking me to deliver 24,000
mozzarel in two days.
(MORE)

61.
MUD MAN (CONT'D)
We’re not even in the same
universe, capisc? Now listen good:
don’t you go stressing me during my
relaxing vacation, cuz the last guy
who did that never managed to relax
again... Ciao.
I'll send you a WhatsApp tomorrow.

34. EXT. HOTEL POOL. DAY
Jimmy Tree and Fred Ballinger float serenely in the pool.
Side by side, their shoulders resting against the edge of the
pool, they let themselves be cradled by the powerful jet of
water hitting their backs.
Fred opens one eye and spots Mick walking with the doctor not
too far away. They are speaking intently. Fred closes his
eye.
Fred and Jimmy float in silence, eyes closed.
... until the arrival of the boy violinist makes them open
their eyes.
BOY
Hello, Fred Ballinger.
FRED BALLINGER
Hi.
BOY
I wanted to tell you that I checked
at the front desk, and you really
are Fred Ballinger.
FRED BALLINGER
Good, I’m glad you set your mind to
rest on that score.
Jimmy Tree smiles.
BOY
There’s something else I wanted to
tell you too.
FRED BALLINGER
Go right ahead.
BOY
I wanted to tell you that ever
since you corrected the position of
my elbow, I play better. The sounds
comes more naturally.
FRED BALLINGER
Very good. Do you know why? Because
you’re left-handed.
(MORE)

62.
FRED BALLINGER (CONT'D)
And left-handed people are
irregular, so an irregular position
helps.

Now we see - we didn’t before - the South American’s fat face
looming close to ours. He has been listening in on the
conversation, and, in a strong Spanish accent, says candidly
to the other three:
OBESE SOUTH AMERICAN
I’m left-handed too.
Fred, Jimmy, and the boy are astounded and look at him
excitedly.
Jimmy flashes him a beautiful smile and says:
JIMMY TREE
Christ! The whole world knows
you’re left handed.
35. INT. HOTEL POND. DAY
Lena, wearing only a towel, sits at the edge of a beautiful
pond. Her long wet hair falling on her shoulders, she seems
even more beautiful than she really is.
The hippy mountaineer, all excited, is facing her. He too in
only a towel. With his hairy shoulders, hairy chest, shaggy
beard, and long hair, he looks like a giant bear, like some
large, peaceful beast.
Lena keeps her eyes closed. The mountaineer can’t take his
kindly eyes off of her.
He swallows, musters his courage, starts to say something,
changes his mind, too timid to speak, then tries again. This
is his chance. He has a heavy Tyrolean accent.
MOUNTAINEER
I’m Luca. Luca Moroder.
Embarrassed, he lets out a moronic laugh that sounds like a
thunderclap.
Lena opens her eyes, expressionless, and simply says:
LENA
Hello.
MOUNTAINEER
I’m a mountaineer. And I teach
climbing. I give lessons at the
hotel.
And he produces another laugh, so moronic it makes us doubt
his intelligence.

63.

MOUNTAINEER (CONT’D)
This is a Forerunner 620, it has a
color touch display, it estimates
VO2max values - the maximum rate of
oxygen consumption during maximum
exertion. I’d like to give it to my
cousin for Christmas. We always go
climbing together. He was supposed
to be here too, but he slipped in
the bathtub and broke his femur.
Lena smiles politely.
LENA
The bathtub is more dangerous than
Mount Everest.
MOUNTAINEER
How true. (hesitates) Do you know
what I found once, on the K2
summit?
LENA
What?
MOUNTAINEER
A bedside table.
LENA
No.
MOUNTAINEER
Yes, I did. I opened the drawer,
but it was empty.
He’s quiet for a moment but then starts in again.
MOUNTAINEER (CONT’D)
It’s an amazing feeling, climbing,
you know? A real sense of freedom.
Yet another moronic laugh, as if he’d never be able to
confirm what he just said.
Lena closes her eyes again and comments somewhat ironically:
LENA
All I would feel is fear.
MOUNTAINEER
That’s an amazing feeling too, you
know.
And he laughs again.
Lena opens her eyes but doesn’t look at him.

64.

Overlooking the little pond is a glass cube that houses the
indoor pool. With an expressionless face, Fred Ballinger
looks out the window at his daughter down below.
36. EXT. HOTEL SOLARIUM. DAY
Fred, Mick, and Jimmy Tree, in white robes, are sunning
peacefully on chaise lounges. Eyes closed. Fred has a
newspaper open on his lap. Mick and Jimmy are chatting.
JIMMY TREE
So who’s the most talented actress
you’ve ever worked with, Mr. Boyle?
MICK BOYLE
Brenda Morel. Without a doubt. A
genius. She can’t have read more
than two books her whole life, and
one of them was her autobiography,
written by a ghost writer
naturally, but still, Brenda’s a
genius.
Jimmy chuckles.
JIMMY TREE
A genius in what sense?
MICK BOYLE
If you know how to steal, you don’t
need training. Stealing becomes
your education. That’s how Brenda
is. Even when, thanks to my films,
she’d become a diva, she never
forgot where she came from, her
home was really the street. And
that’s where she stayed, on the
street, stealing everything.
Everything. Which is how she
created such unforgettable
characters. And won two Oscars.
JIMMY TREE
What would she steal?
MICK BOYLE
We were filming “The Crystal
Woman.” And in the middle of a
scene, an electrician walks by,
toward the back of the set. He’s
got this limp, real slight.
Whenever he steps with his shorter
leg, it makes a noise, real faint
though, barely noticeable. No one
even hears it, no one but Brenda,
that is.
(MORE)

65.
MICK BOYLE (CONT'D)
She’s reciting her lines and all of
a sudden she yells “stop.” So I
yell back, “What the fuck are you
doing, Brenda? Only I can say
stop.” “Fuck that, Mick,” she says
to me, “if my character is wrong,
then I’ll say stop.” She looks at
the electrician. He’s dying, but
Brenda lights up and says, “Mick,
my character has to have one leg
shorter than the other. She limps.”
I practically fall off my chair.
“Are you out of your mind, Brenda?”
I say to her. “Your character can’t
limp. Your character is the most
desirable woman in the whole world,
every man on the planet wants to
get her into bed, she’s a dream.”
And you know what she says? She
says to me, “Even dreams have their
problems, Mick.”

Jimmy laughs.
MICK BOYLE (CONT’D)
And she was right. That little limp
won her her second Oscar.
A muffled, intermittent sound, which at first only Fred
hears, makes him open his eyes. But the sun is shining right
in them, so all he can see is a small black circle that rises
up to the sky and then falls again. The sound, and then the
black circle again.
It’s enough to make Fred want to get up and take a look.
Curious, he shuffles toward the tennis court, and Jimmy Tree
and Mick Boyle decide to go with him.
37. EXT. TENNIS COURT. DAY
At the tennis court, Fred, Mick, and Jimmy are struck dumb by
what they see.
That obese South American is doing something out of this
world: with his left foot he sends a tennis ball flying high
in the air, and when it comes down, he kicks it up again,
without ever letting it touch the ground, sending it sixty,
seventy feet in the air. The tennis ball against the blue
sky. It falls, he kicks it again, with a naturalness despite the inhuman effort it takes for that massive body to
move - that sparks admiration and horror at the same time.
Mick, Jimmy, and Fred can’t believe their eyes. Rightly so.
After five or six feats of such amazing acrobatics, he stops,
completely exhausted. He has trouble catching his breath.

66.

Jimmy spots his briarwood cane, leaning against the fence. He
grabs it and rushes over with it.
The South American thanks him, eyes brimming with gratitude,
body dripping with sweat. Without saying a word, he slowly
walks away, leaning heavily on his cane.
Two guitar notes, melancholy and discreet, accompany the
South American’s broken, belabored gait.
Jimmy, Fred, and Mick just stand there, scattered around the
tennis court, and watch the best ex-soccer player in the
world leave the field.
FADE TO BLACK.
38. INT. ROOM. AFTERNOON
FADE IN:
The two guitar notes float in here, without developing
further.
A flowered wall, English style. In front of it is a small
table with a magnificent silver tea service.
A women’s purse, flung by who knows whom, crashes into the
tea set. Everything ends up on the floor. The purse tumbles
open. It’s empty.
After a moment, the Queen's emissary enters the frame. He is
very distraught. He says in a whisper.
QUEEN’S EMISSARY
Your Majesty, you nearly hit me!
QUEEN ELIZABETH’S VOICE
Yes, Mr. Bale, I nearly hit you.
The devastated emissary sighs. It’s as if the whole universe
were going to hell in a handbag.
39. INT. HOTEL RESTAURANT. EVENING
The two guitar notes die softly during this scene.
The German couple is silent again. They eat serenely, their
eyes never meeting.
The hippy mountaineer looks dejected, as if all his hopes
have been dashed as he steals glances at Lena, sitting with
Fred and Mick. She doesn’t even notice him.

67.

Jimmy Tree is dining with Mark Kozelek and other friends.
They’re laughing at Jimmy’s perfect imitation of Marlon
Brando.
Sushi tonight. Everyone’s using chopsticks.
Fred, Mick, and Lena dine in silence.
Lena says routinely.
LENA
The French called again. They
really want to do that book with
you... your memoirs, everything
about your work, your life. What
shall I tell them?
FRED BALLINGER
(reflects) Tell them...
He doesn’t know what else to say. Silence. Lena and Mick
wait.
LENA
What?
FRED BALLINGER
To forget me! Tell them that. I'm
retired! I’m done! With work and
life.
Mick raises his eyes heavenward, as if he knew this "song"
all too well and can’t stand it anymore.
FRED BALLINGER (CONT’D)
I have nothing to say, and what’s
more, I'm not interested.
MICK BOYLE
Will you cut the crap? Your music
conveyed surprising, new emotions.
FRED BALLINGER
But emotions are overrated too,
Mick.
Mick throws his chopsticks onto the table. He’s really pissed
off.
MICK BOYLE
You're really unbearable when you
play the depressed cynic, Fred.
It’s a mystery how I managed to be
your friend all these years.
FRED BALLINGER
You're a man of much patience,
Mick.

68.

MICK BOYLE
And you're an idiot.
FRED BALLINGER
That's for sure!
Lena is about to say something but Mick cuts her off.
MICK BOYLE
A book about your work, life your
experiences - it would last
forever. It would be a help to
young musicians, to everyone. It's
important...
FRED BALLINGER
(interrupts him) Important!...
Preserve your memory for posterity,
pass on your knowledge. I've been
hearing the same old tune for years
now, but it’s just an excuse, Mick,
a way of ignoring the real problem.
MICK BOYLE
And what’s the real problem, Fred?
FRED BALLINGER
Death, Mick! Death, it’s so close.
LENA
So, instead of living you're
thinking about death coming closer.
Even though you’re still alive.
Mick nods vigorously. He addresses Lena.
MICK BOYLE
Do you see why it pisses me off?
FRED BALLINGER
Yes, Lena sees.
LENA
But doesn’t the idea of reliving
your life, your work, fascinate
you?
FRED BALLINGER
No. It only hurts me. Can’t you see
that? And besides, there's nothing
more to say. Stravinsky already
said it all. He composed simple
music and everyone attacked him.
“He’s abandoned modernism! He’s not
respecting tradition!” the critics
thundered. But he was merely
rediscovering the past, his mirror.
(MORE)

69.
FRED BALLINGER (CONT'D)
That’s when he uttered that
beautiful phrase: "You may respect,
but I love." What more can I add?

Lena and Mick have nothing else to say. Fred picks up his
chopsticks and holds them in the air, not eating. Lena stares
at him.
Out of the blue, the boy violinist comes over. Fred doesn’t
even notice him.
The child gently adjusts Fred’s hand - the one holding the
chopsticks - raising it an inch. As if correcting his
position.
Fred gazes at the boy and smiles sadly.
The boy simply smiles back at him, and then runs off, the way
children do. Always running, they are.
40. EXT. HOTEL GARDEN. NIGHT
A fakir is lying on a bed of nails on the stage.
Lena, Fred, Mick, and Jimmy Tree are sitting together at one
of the tables, impassively watching the show.
JIMMY TREE
These shows are really pathetic.
All that’s missing is a mime.
FRED BALLINGER
We usually get one of those by the
end of the summer as well.
The fakir levitates, rising above the bed of nails.
The audience applauds.
The fakir's back is very red. He spits fire from his mouth
and says.
FAKIR
Thank you, everyone. And now, I
hope you will enjoy some
traditional horn music, played by a
local ensemble.
Eight old men carrying long horns come onto the stage. They
begin a gloomy litany.
A man whom we assume to be the hotel manager comes over to
our characters’ table. He addresses Jimmy Tree, but Fred,
Mick, and Lena listen in as well.

70.

HOTEL MANAGER
Excuse me, Mr. Tree, but a new
guest has arrived. Her name is
Joyce Owens, she has just won the
Miss Universe pageant. She’s a
great admirer of yours and would
like to meet you.
JIMMY TREE
Ok, here I am.
The manager gestures, and Miss Universe appears from a dark
corner of the garden.
Our characters wait for her to arrive, their hearts aflutter.
But Miss Universe turns out to be an unbelievable
disappointment. She’s wearing a cheap, oversize track suit
that ruins her figure and makes her look plump, and - even
though it’s dark - a pair of violet-tinted sunglasses with
vulgar frames that are too big for her face. Her skin is bad,
her hair stringy and dirty. What’s more, she has an awful
voice, which we hear when she shakes Jimmy’s hand.
MISS UNIVERSE
It’s such a pleasure to meet you.
I’m a huge fan of yours. I
literally went crazy when you
played Mister Q.
Jimmy Tree raises his eyes heavenward. He’s had more than
enough of Mister Q.
MISS UNIVERSE (CONT’D)
I never miss a robot movie, but
that one’s my favorite.
JIMMY TREE
(teasing) Thank you. And do you
ever watch any other kinds of
movie, other than robot movies?
MISS UNIVERSE
Of course! I’ve got my whole life
ahead of me, and I want to be an
actress. I don't want to just rely
on my beauty.
JIMMY TREE
(chuckles) What else do you watch?
Cartoons?
Miss Universe stiffens a little.
MISS UNIVERSE
Whatever I want.
JIMMY TREE
Brava, Miss Universe!

71.

MISS UNIVERSE
(now very serious) You know
something, Mr. Tree?
JIMMY TREE
What?
MISS UNIVERSE
I appreciate irony, but when it is
drenched in poison, it is drained
of its force and reveals something
else.
JIMMY TREE
What does it reveal? Tell me.
MISS UNIVERSE
Frustration. Yours, in this case,
not mine.
JIMMY TREE
(leaning forward, nervous) I'm
frustrated, Miss Universe?
MISS UNIVERSE
I'm happy I took part in the Miss
Universe pageant. Are you happy you
played Mister Q?
Jimmy Tree has no answer for her.
Embarassment washes over the whole group.
Jimmy extends a hand to Miss Universe, as if to acknowledge
defeat. But Miss Universe doesn’t shake it. She walks away.
Mick smooths his hair with the palm of his hand as Jimmy
looks on.
Watching Miss Universe as she quickly disappears, Mick, to
break the chill that has descended...
MICK BOYLE
How unbearable the insolent
ostentation of youth is.
FRED BALLINGER
In particular if the person
listening is no longer young.
MICK BOYLE
(laughing) That woman should be
stabbed to death, I mean stabbed!
Fred turns to look at Jimmy who has gone back to watching the
horn ensemble. And he says a touch of irony.

72.

FRED BALLINGER
She's not at all stupid, Miss
Universe.
Jimmy, without looking at him, replies immediately.
JIMMY TREE
Not at all!
They both break out in big smiles.
Lena watches Miss Universe walk across the garden, that
peculiar look in her eye that women have when watching
another woman. And when Miss Universe disappears from view,
Lena does something: she turns ninety degrees and looks
squarely at the mountaineer, who, naturally, is looking at
her. His eyes are sparkling like never before.
41. EXT./INT. (MUSIC VIDEO) CAR. DAY.
(The whole scene is shot and edited in the style of a music
video).
Music so funky it would make a corpse dance:"Can't rely on
you."
A luxury car - a Maserati - races along a sun-kissed mountain
road. Julian is driving. A splendidly made-up Paloma Faith
appears in the backseat. She is the one who is singing. She’s
wearing sexy lingerie and moving her body in the most
sinuous, sensual manner. A totally different Paloma from the
dull, anonymous woman we saw earlier. She flicks her tongue
in Julian's ear and he howls with pleasure. Down on all
fours, she moves like a panther in the back seat, upping the
eroticism with every gesture. Slithering like a snake, she
slips out the open window and climbs gracefully onto the
roof, singing the whole time. She gets to her feet and dances
on top of the car, as sensual and sexy as before.
The only reason she doesn’t fall off the roof of the moving
car is because we are very clearly in the unreal world of
music video.
Julian leans out of the window and watches her from below,
turned on and moaning like a fool. He leans so far out of the
car trying to grab her that he has to hold the steering wheel
with his foot.
The car swerves, but there’s no danger: we’re in a music
video.
Julian climbs back into the driver's seat to avoid an
accident.
He fixes his eyes on the road, but is not for long: Paloma
now appears on the front windshield.

73.

Slowly, she slithers down the windshield onto the hood.
Pressing her body against the glass, she winks at him, makes
eyes at him, shows him her tongue and everything else as she
rolls onto the hood, the car still tearing along at 120mph,
the wind in her hair.
With an acrobatic move, Paloma finally climbs through the
window again and is back in the car.
She sits next to Julian. He wants to touch her, but she coyly
prevents him, increasing his desire. She’s been singing the
whole time, but now she pauses the song for a moment and
says.
PALOMA FAITH
Now watch what I'm going to do for
you!
She opens the glove compartment and produces a sex toy the
likes of which has never been seen before.
A huge black rubber ball studded with menacing metal,
luminescent stingers. It’s impossible even to imagine what
you could do with it.
PALOMA FAITH (CONT’D)
Watch this, honey.
And the spiked, luminescent ball slowly disappears beneath
her body, but just then...
JULIAN
Holy shit!
42. INT. FRED BALLINGER’S SUITE. NIGHT
... DARKNESS.
A woman’s scream shatters the music and everything else.
Alarmed, Fred Ballinger switches on the lamp on the night
stand. Lena awakens with a start, as if from a nightmare.
She’s sweating, panicked. She can’t breathe.
FRED BALLINGER
Lena, what’s wrong?
Lena is gasping for breath. She slowly comes back to reality,
her breath returning to normal. She reassures her father.
LENA
Nothing, nothing. It was just a
dream.
FRED BALLINGER
A nightmare?

74.

LENA
Let’s say somewhere between the
two. It’s over now.
Fred turns off the light. Half-light. Lena slowly settles
down, but she can’t fall asleep. They have their backs to
each other. After a while she asks.
LENA (CONT’D)
As a man, how did Miss Universe
seem to you?
FRED BALLINGER
An unbelievable disappointment.
Lena is greatly cheered by her father’s remark. Then, after a
pause.
LENA
Daddy, I have to tell you
something... personal.
FRED BALLINGER
Tell me, Lena.
LENA
Julian’s an ass. Because I’m really
good in bed.
FRED BALLINGER
I know.
LENA
What do you mean... you know?
FRED BALLINGER
You’re my daughter. And, in all
modesty, I was a wonder between the
sheets myself.
Slowly but surely, once their embarrassment has faded, they
start sniggering in the dark, each on his own side of the
bed.
43. INT. CRAFT SHOP. DAY
A shop full of souvenirs and local crafts made of wood.
Fred roams around, glancing at the stuff on the shelves, but
without much interest.
Jimmy Tree goes over to the cash register and - proud at
having found it - presents a briarwood walking stick, very
similar to the one we saw the South American using. The sales
clerk starts wrapping it.

75.

Jimmy is waiting when the pale, thirteen-year-old girl from
the hotel appears at his side. Pink circles around her eyes,
making her seem not scary exactly, but vaguely pained.
She bites her nails nervously as she stares at Jimmy, who
senses her presence and so turns to her.
She stares unabashed at him, long and hard enough to make
Jimmy feel embarrassed, and then says confidently.
PALE GIRL
I saw you in a film once.
JIMMY TREE
So you liked Mister Q as well?
PALE GIRL
No, I saw you in that film where
you play a father who never knew
his son and meets him for the first
time in a highway diner when the
son’s already fourteen.
Jimmy turns to stone. He mutters.
JIMMY TREE
But nobody saw that movie!
PALE GIRL
There was a bit of dialog I really
liked, when your son says, "Why
weren't you a father to me?" and
you say, "I didn't think I was up
to it." At that moment I understood
something really important.
JIMMY TREE
What?
PALE GIRL
That no one in the whole world
feels up to it. And so there's no
reason to worry. Bye. See you at
the hotel.
And the girl walks away, her stride natural and easy.
Jimmy just stands there, immobile, at the counter, staring
into space. He’s stunned. Instinctively, he puts on his
sunglasses.
Fred, standing still behind him among the shelves, must have
heard everything, because he merely stares at Jimmy's back.
He is as overcome as Jimmy is, and doesn’t say a word. He
just looks at back of the actor who is probably deeply moved
right now.

76.

44. EXT. COUNTRY LANE. DAY
Jimmy and Fred walk along the beautiful lane that skirts the
mountain village.
They walk in silence, wrapped in perfect sounds: cicadas and
distant cowbells.
JIMMY TREE
What do you do all day, Fred?
FRED BALLINGER
They tell me I’m apathetic. So I
don’t do anything.
JIMMY TREE
Don’t you miss your work?
FRED BALLINGER
Not at all. I worked far too much.
JIMMY TREE
So what do you miss?
FRED BALLINGER
My wife. I miss my wife Melanie.
JIMMY TREE
I read on Wikipedia that you hung
out with Stravinsky for a while
when you were young.
FRED BALLINGER
True.
JIMMY TREE
What was he like?
FRED BALLINGER
He was a very placid man.
JIMMY TREE
Placid? That’s all? Be generous
with me, Fred. I need a generous
friend. Tell me about Stravinsky.
FRED BALLINGER
One day he said to me,
“Intellectuals don’t have any
taste.” So from that day on, I did
everything I could not to be an
intellectual. And I succeeded.
Jimmy doesn’t say anything. They walk on in silence.
FRED BALLINGER (CONT’D)
And you? What do you miss?

77.

JIMMY TREE
Nothing, I’d say. Luckily.
FRED BALLINGER
Be generous with me, Jimmy.
Jimmy smiles, as if caught red-handed.
JIMMY TREE
What I missed I discovered four
months ago reading Novalis.
Fred is surprised.
FRED BALLINGER
You read Novalis?
JIMMY TREE
(playful) Even actors from
California, when they’re not
getting drunk, snorting coke, or
hanging out with anorexic models,
occasionally read Novalis.
FRED BALLINGER
You're right, sorry. I'm an old man
and full of prejudices. And what
does Novalis say?
JIMMY TREE
"I'm always going home, always
going to my father's house."
45. EXT. GARDEN HOTEL. NIGHT
Mark Kozelek presses play on an iPod, and the sweet notes of
a synthesizer float out the speakers. It’s a slow, hypnotic
track. The camera moves slowly around the room; it takes in
Kozelek and Jimmy Tree's friends, who are listening
seriously, attentively to the music. The camera glides out
onto the terrace and takes in Jimmy Tree, lying on a chaise
lounge and listening very intently to the music. He smokes a
cigarette, which he then puts out in a cup of herbal tea.
Mark Kozelek comes out and joins him. He lies down on the
chaise lounge next to Jimmy’s.
MARK KOZELEK
How do you like it? I wrote it
yesterday. It’s called “Ceiling
Gazing.”
Jimmy listens and then says sincerely.
JIMMY TREE
It’s fabulous, Mark.

78.

On the track, Mark’s voice joins in and blends with the
synthesizer. A voice so romantic it gives you the chills.
46. INT/EXT. REAR GARDEN HOTEL/ MASSEUSE’S ROOM. NIGHT
The beautiful music continues, extra-diegetic now. It’s
really moving.
Softly, as if in slow motion, the tiny, timid masseuse comes
into the camera’s eye. In close-up now, she’s dancing. She’s
playing with Kinect again, but a different dance now.
47. INT./EXT. SOUTH AMERICAN’S SUITE/REAR GARDEN HOTEL. NIGHT
The beautiful music can be heard here as well.
The South American is on the terrace, in his underwear. He’s
half-reclining on a chaise lounge. His wife is at the foot of
the lounge, massaging his massive, aching legs.
He stares out across the valley. And then, suddenly, it’s
like he has a vision. Bright lights come on, like the
floodlights at a soccer stadium, and he sees twenty-two men,
divided into two rows of eleven. One row is wearing the
Argentina national team jersey, and the other that of
England. The twenty-two players clamber up the steep field
and arrive at the hotel garden. They merge into a single row
and wave to a crowd that is not there. It seems like the lead
up to an important soccer match.
Overcome with emotion, the South American stares at this
vision.
His wife looks up at him sadly. She sees he is moved and asks
in Spanish.
SOUTH AMERICAN’S WIFE
What are you thinking about?
The stadium floodlights suddenly go out.
SOUTH AMERICAN
The future.
48. INT. FRED BALLINGER’S SUITE. NIGHT
Kozelek’s music dies down here. It’s instrumental now, which
makes it seem remote and discreet.
Lena is asleep in the bed. Half-light.
Fred is in the little living room, sitting in the middle of
the couch. From here he can see Lena asleep in the distance.
He looks away, and stares into space.

79.

He’s thinking, his thumb and index finger rubbing a candy
wrapper imperceptibly at irregular intervals, creating a
beautiful, elementary melody.
And that slight sound is what awakens Lena. She opens an eye.
Without moving, she studies her father from the bed as he
sits motionless on the couch.
49. INT. HOTEL RECEPTION. NIGHT
The lights are dimmed for the night. Two concierges are
checking in a group of six guests who have just arrived.
They’re all about forty years old, four women and two men,
normal faces. But they have some unusual baggage: rigid metal
suitcases. Two other women arrive, wheeling metal racks from
which hang dozens of outfits, covered in garment bags.
They all seem really tired. Kozelek’s music caresses them...
50. INT. SALINE GROTTO. NIGHT
... and flows here.
A fake underground grotto with papier-mâché walls made to
look like the Alps.
A long spiral staircase in the center goes down and down,
finishing right in a large round pool full of dark water with
so much salt that you can do the dead man’s float without the
least effort.
And in fact, Mick Boyle and his five screenwriters are
floating naked on their backs in a studied darkness.
They’re brainstorming about the ending of “Life’s Last Day.”
FUNNY SCREENWRITER
He’s on his deathbed, and murmurs
to her, “I should have devoted
myself to you, and to our love,
instead of wasting my life trying
to become the king of insurance
policies.”
SCREENWRITER IN LOVE
Or maybe he just says something
banal to her, real simple, like
“Take care of yourself.”
INTELLECTUAL SCREENWRITER
No, we have to stay with the
physical pain right up to the end.
How about if he says, “Not even
morphine can help me now.”

80.

FEMALE SCREENWRITER
What if he focuses on some
insignificant detail? If he said
something like, “I wonder whatever
happened to that key ring you gave
me twenty-five years ago, the one
shaped like a horseshoe?”
MICK BOYLE
No. He doesn’t say anything on his
deathbed.
Silence on the part of the screenwriters. They’re waiting.
MICK BOYLE (CONT’D)
She’s the one who talks. Brenda.
She says, “I lost so much time
because of you, Michael. I lost the
best years of my life.”
Silence. Then the shy screenwriter.
SHY SCREENWRITER
He’s lying on his deathbed, and she
slaps him, just like that.
An icy stare from Mick and the others. The shy screenwriter
tries to make eat his words.
SHY SCREENWRITER (CONT’D)
I was just kidding!
51. INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. NIGHT
Kozelek’s sweet music follows us here, in the stillness of
the hallway of this mountain hotel. The group of people who
recently checked in are coming toward us, wheeling their
metal racks and cumbersome metal suitcases.
The group passes a room, the door slightly ajar, without even
noticing it.
But the camera notices and peeks inside. On the bed sits a
elderly, bare-chested man, exhausted and sweaty. He stares at
the floor and drinks a glass of water. The unattractive,
plump hooker is putting on her overcoat. She exits the room
and makes her way awkwardly and gracelessly to the elevator.
52. INT. PANORAMA HALL. NIGHT
The Ipod again, Mark Kozelek’s music again, diegetic now.
A man gently combs Jimmy’s hair and pulls it back, as Jimmy
looks at himself in the mirror, a serious expression on his
face. One of those dressing room mirrors, with all those
little lights around it.

81.

The hairdresser uses a razor to layer the hair on the back of
Jimmy’s head. He cuts it really short. A tense, somber mood.
The other members of the group are watching Jimmy and his
hairdresser.
Then, with a quick, expert move, the hairdresser moves a lock
of Jimmy’s hair to the right.
He sticks his fingers in a jar of brilliantine.
A middle-aged woman carefully unzips one of the garment bags
and we get a glimpse of a green outfit.
53. EXT. HOTEL POOL. DAWN
Kozelek’s music swells slightly, moving us even more.
The lights in the pool are on, creating a marvelous blue
glow.
We see
slowly
tired,
starts

Jimmy Tree from the back, his hair quite short. He’s
doing the breaststroke. He gets out, his movements
limited, like an old man’s. He drys himself off and
getting dressed. We still haven’t seen his face.

In the distance, behind the mountains, dawn is breaking.
Kozelek's music vanishes.
54. EXT. HOTEL GARDEN. DAY
Adolf Hitler, in military uniform, is attempting to strut
across the garden, beneath a long canopy. He manages in part
thanks to the briarwood cane. His steps are short, uncertain:
in other words, an older Hitler, in his sixties, full of
aches and pains.
He marches past the camera. It’s not Hitler, it’s Jimmy Tree,
in a perfect character reconstruction.
He walks slowly, almost prudently, but with an austere,
dictatorial demeanor that erases the distinction between
Jimmy’s character and the real Hitler. He looks around, but
no one’s there.
Then, all of a sudden, Hitler stops. He puts his palm on his
forehead to smooth down his hair, just as Mick Boyle does all
the time, and then, with a certain pomposity, gives the Nazi
salute.
He has saluted Frances, the pale thirteen-year-old girl who
stands before him. Jimmy keeps his arm raised, waiting for a
reaction. She merely looks calmly at him and smiles, not in
the least frightened by this unusual performance.

82.

55. INT. COVERED POOL. DAY
Mick Boyle is lying on a chaise lounge near the pool, wrapped
in a robe.
Lena swims languidly, without much effort.
Other than Mick and Lena, there’s no one there.
MICK BOYLE
I’ve never told you how sorry I am
about how things ended between you
and Julian.
Lena stops near the edge of the pool.
MICK BOYLE (CONT’D)
I mean, I want to apologize for his
behavior.
LENA
“Apologize?” What do you have to do
with it?
MICK BOYLE
Let's face it, as a father, I could
have done more.
LENA
Julian did what he wanted to,
without worrying about the
consequences. He picked up the
scent. I'm starting to smell it as
well.
MICK BOYLE
What scent?
LENA
(smiling) The dizzying scent of
freedom.
MICK BOYLE
(smiles) Oh right, I know that
scent.
LENA
But Daddy really didn’t tell you
anything about the Queen, about the
Simple Songs he was supposed to
conduct in London, and how he
refused?
MICK BOYLE
No. He didn’t tell me a thing.

83.

LENA
What a strange friendship you two
have.
MICK BOYLE
Strange? No, it’s a good
friendship. And in a good
friendship, you only tell each
other the good things. He must have
thought that the Queen’s concert
wasn’t one of them.
LENA
He says he can’t conduct his
“Simple Songs” because the only
person who could sing them was my
mother.
MICK BOYLE
(surprised) He said that?
LENA
Yes, that's what he told the
Queen's emissary.
MICK BOYLE
It took him eighty years to finally
say something romantic, and who
does he go and say it to? The
Queen's emissary.
Lena smiles. And so does Mick.
LENA
He watches me at night, while I
sleep. And tonight, for the first
time in my life, he caressed me as
I was asleep. Only I wasn’t asleep,
I was pretending.
MICK BOYLE
Parents know when their children
are pretending to be asleep.
Lena’s eyes are bright now, and she turns her back to Mick so
he can’t see how touched she is.
MICK BOYLE (CONT’D)
Are you worried about him?
LENA
No, I’m not worried about him.
56. INT. HOTEL DINING ROOM. DAY
We’re well aware that this hotel is a quiet place, but it has
never been this silent before.

84.

Everyone is looking in the same direction: at the table where
Adolf Hitler, indifferent to all those around him, is digging
in to a hearty breakfast.
And the astounding thing is that they’re all looking at him
deferentially, in awe, as if this were actually the real
Hitler, sixty years later. So much so that some of them,
passing by him on their way out of the dining room, end up
bowing ever so slightly, respectfully, to the fuhrer and
saying “Good morning.”
Hitler returns their greeting with the hint of a haughty
salute.
Then Jimmy/Hitler takes a handkerchief out of his pocket,
blows his nose, rubs the tip quickly four times, just as he
had always seen Fred do, folds it, and puts it back in his
pocket.
Fred Ballinger observes Jimmy from his table and, on seeing
his own habitual gesture reinterpreted by Hitler, smiles
strangely.
Then the silent German couple stop in front of Hitler and the
woman stares severely at Jimmy/Hitler. In a serious voice,
she orders him.
GERMAN WOMAN
Don't you ever dare to do that
again.
57. INT. SKI LIFT. DAY
Fred and Mick, all decked out for trekking (hats, sunglasses,
the latest backpacks, formfitting, orange synthetic T-shirts,
Bermuda shorts, colorful Solomon hiking shoes, and poles) sit
next to each other on the ski lift, suspended in mid-air as
they climb up to 10,000 feet. They look up at the vertiginous
peaks and the jagged rock face of the mountains as they sail
silently upward.
After a while.
MICK BOYLE
I talked with Lena a bit this
morning. She’s worried about you.
Fred stares at the mountain peak, impassive. Mick waits, but
Fred doesn’t respond.
MICK BOYLE (CONT’D)
It's years since you went to see
Melanie. Why don't you go? Venice
is so close.

85.

Fred is impassive. He doesn’t say a word. Mick turns to look
at him, but Fred keeps staring straight ahead, his eyes on
the mountain. Mick tries again.
MICK BOYLE (CONT’D)
Lena told me about this story with
Queen Elizabeth. You didn’t breathe
a word to me about it. Well, it
could be pretty nice, no? I’d be so
happy to hear Simple Song No. 3
played live one last time.
FRED BALLINGER
I wouldn't.
MICK BOYLE
You don't want to betray the memory
of Melanie, but sometimes, in order
to remain faithful, you have to
have the courage to betray. Don't
you agree?
Fred, after a silence, as he looks at the mountain.
FRED BALLINGER
Mick, there’s something that I just
can’t get out of my head.
MICK BOYLE
What?
FRED BALLINGER
What it would have been like to
sleep with Gilda Black!
MICK BOYLE
(embarrassed) Yeah! I wonder too!
Fred turns to scrutinize Mick, because he doesn’t trust the
truth of his words. In a hiss halfway between serious and
humorous, he says.
FRED BALLINGER
Liar!
Mick avoids his friend’s gaze.
58. EXT. MOUNTAIN. DAY
It’s so beautiful here, the silence and the pure air of the
mountains at 10,000 feet.
Fred and
a valley
them and
and pops

Mick are sitting on a grassy slope that gives on to
far below. There’s no one there, only the two of
all this nature and silence. Fred unwraps a candy
it in his mouth.

86.

After a sizeable silence, Fred pierces the soft mountain
breeze.
FRED BALLINGER
Hey Mick.
MICK BOYLE
Yeah?
FRED BALLINGER
Why are we dressed like this?
Mick sniggers.
There in that immense silence, Fred starts rubbing the candy
wrapper in time to some inner music. Mick casts a sidelong
glance at his friend’s fingers.
MICK BOYLE
That’s not so great.
FRED BALLINGER
What?
MICK BOYLE
The piece you’re playing with that
candy wrapper. You’ve done a lot
better than that in your lifetime.
Now it’s Fred who sniggers a bit. Then he turns serious.
58A. EXT. HOTEL GARDEN. NIGHT
The hooker's tiny mother, hand in hand with her plump, clumsy
daughter. They walk under the long canopy that runs through
the garden. The neon "Hotel" sign looms above them.
They arrive at the hotel entrance. As always, the mother
kisses her daughter and then tells her.
HOOKER'S MOTHER
Do good things.
The daughter enters the hotel. The mother gives her one last
look.
59. INT. PRIVATE SAUNA POOL. DAY
Mick and Fred are the only ones sitting on the boiling wooden
benches. Skinny little towels cover their private parts.
They’re sweating like pigs. It seems as if they could die at
any moment.
They sit in silence, exhausted from the infernal heat, when a
vision brings them back to the spectacle of life.

87.

A statuesque woman appears, wrapped in a robe. She takes it
off. Naked. Her beauty and corporeal perfection are the
epitome of sensational. With utmost elegance and femininity,
this creature - for that is what she is - places a towel on
the wooden bench and gently reclines. Indifferent to her own
nakedness and to the two old men, she closes her eyes and
relaxes.
Not only is this woman completely comfortable, but she seems
to have been created to make the rest of world uncomfortable.
Fred and Mick, ill at ease, stare at her the way one stares
at those paranormal - and therefore inexplicable - phenomena
in nature.
It takes them an unreasonable amount of time to regain any
semblance of rational thought. They begin whispering to each
other, so as not to be overheard by that perfect creature.
FRED BALLINGER
Who is she?
MICK BOYLE
What do you mean, who is she? Miss
Universe.
FRED BALLINGER
She looks completely different,
unrecognizable.
MICK BOYLE
She’s been transformed, from
watching all those robot movies.
Fred doesn’t laugh. He can’t. He has to gaze dizzily at Miss
Universe, whose beauty drains him.
MICK BOYLE (CONT’D)
You know something, Fred? By dint
of all our piss talk, we’ve
forgotten that that organ is also
made to fulfill other functions.
FRED BALLINGER
Take it easy with those illusions,
Mick.
MICK BOYLE
Illusions? You know they make these
little pills now...
FRED BALLINGER
Yeah, but it distorts the reality
of the situation.
MICK BOYLE
And so? And what have I been doing
my whole life making films?

88.

Miss Universe languidly shifts her legs a few inches, just
enough to inflict further despair on our two old men.
FRED BALLINGER
Anyway, she’s not interested, Mick,
She’s interested in a body that
corresponds to hers. Sex is like
music, it wants harmony. And
rightly so. We’re no longer in any
condition to harmonize with anyone,
Mick.
They could cry at this point, and they might have, if an
attendant hadn’t come into the sauna just then.
ATTENDANT
Excuse me, Mr. Boyle, there’s
someone here to see you.
MICK BOYLE
(snorts) Can’t you see that we’re
living the last great idyll of our
lives? Well, who's the pain in the
neck?
ATTENDANT
Brenda Morel.
60. INT. PANORAMA HALL/ BALLROOM. DAY
Here she is, the genius, Brenda Morel. Who was once a deeply
mysterious femme fatale. Impeccable, sitting up straight in a
small armchair. Over eighty years old. Numerous face lifts. A
delicate diamond choker sparkles among her wrinkles, which
are more obstinate than her plastic surgeon. A cascade of
blond hair that make us wonder about her hairdresser.
While she waits, she expertly runs her tongue over her entire
dental arch, making sure that her lipstick hasn’t stained her
perfect dentures.
Mick enters, sparking an orgy of joy and affectation. But not
Brenda. She is serious. Aloof.
MICK BOYLE
Brenda! What a fabulous, marvelous
surprise!
BRENDA
Hi, Mick.
They kiss each other on the cheek.
MICK BOYLE
You look fabulous, Brenda. The very
picture of radiance and sex appeal.

89.

BRENDA
You're getting mixed up with last
millennium, Mick.
Mick laughs theatrically.
MICK BOYLE
What, you just couldn’t wait any
longer? We just finished the latest
version, you know. We were having
trouble with the ending, but then
yesterday, eureka! it came to us.
So now that you’re here in the
flesh, we can hand it to you. But
didn’t you tell me you were going
to be in Los Angeles? What are you
doing in Europe?
Brenda looks Mick in the eyes.
BRENDA
How long have we known each other,
Mick?
MICK BOYLE
Jesus, you’re putting me on the
spot! Let me count...
BRENDA
Fifty-three years. And how many
films have we made together?
MICK BOYLE
Nine, ten...
BRENDA
Eleven. And do you really think
that after fifty-three years of
friendship and eleven films
together that now I’m going to
start bullshitting you, of all
people?
MICK BOYLE
(bewildered) No, no I don’t... I
wouldn’t deserve that.
BRENDA
Right, you don’t deserve it. You
deserve me to call a spade a spade.
Which is why I dragged my ass here
from LA. To talk to you in person.
Brenda’s seriousness, her severity, makes Mick anxious.

90.

MICK BOYLE
I see. Look, Brenda, if it’s about
scene 21, where you’re described as
“ugly, feeble, a pale shadow of
your former beauty,” well, please
realize that that’s just poetic
license, but on set, naturally,
we’ll proceed in a totally
different way. I want you to be
extraordinary. You still preserve
intact - you have to - that
mystery, that allure that made you
a diva in the first place.
BRENDA
Don’t go licking my ass, Mick, it
just breaks my balls even more,
especially given what I came here
to tell you.
MICK BOYLE
Why? What did you come to tell me?
BRENDA
I’m not doing the film, Mick.
MICK BOYLE
What?
BRENDA
They offered me a TV series in New
Mexico. A three year contract. An
alcoholic grandmother who’s had a
serious stroke. A character with
real balls. With the money I’ll be
able to pay for Jack’s drug rehab,
my niece Angelica’s film school
tuition, pay off my idiotic
husband’s debts, and still have
enough money left over for a house
in Miami, which I’ve been wanting
for fourteen years. That’s what I
came to tell you.
Mick objects, raising his voice.
MICK BOYLE
But this is cinema, Brenda! That’s
just television. Television’s shit.
BRENDA
Television’s the future, Mick. To
tell you the truth, it’s also the
present. So let’s be frank, Mick,
because nobody speaks frankly in
this fucking film world.
(MORE)

91.
BRENDA (CONT'D)
You’re going on eighty, and like
most of your colleagues, you’ve
gotten worse with age. The last
three films you made were shit,
Mick. I’m telling you, according to
me and according to everybody, they
were real shit!

Mick Boyle is practically having a heart attack. He’s
shouting in a way he shouldn’t, given his age and his high
blood pressure.
MICK BOYLE
How dare you! How dare you! How
dare you! So you want to be frank,
do you? Fine, let’s be frank. Fiftythree years ago, if it weren’t for
me, who was, is, and always will be
a gentleman, you would still be
crouching under some producer’s
desk. I pulled you out of all those
fat producers’ underpants and made
you into an actress.
Brenda is fuming, her eyes ablaze. She screams at him.
BRENDA
What a little shit you are! I was
just fine in those producers’
underpants. And you know why?
Because I wanted to be there. I
don’t owe anybody anything. I did
it all myself. I paid my way at the
Actors Studio by cleaning toilets
all over Brooklyn, my mother went
into debt for me. And in Hollywood
I walked through the front door,
all by myself. Marilyn, Rita,
Grace, they’d all shit in their
pants when they saw me coming. It’s
all written down, right there in my
autobiography, don’t tell me you
haven’t read it?
MICK BOYLE
Unfortunately I have. Except you
didn’t write it. And it was a piece
of shit, your autobiography, just
like this TV series you’re going to
do, real shit.
Brenda sighs, as if she needed air, but then, surprisingly,
she stops shouting. She calms down and starts speaking in a
quiet voice that makes her seem even more ruthless than when
she was yelling.

92.

BRENDA
The real shit is this film of
yours, Mick. I understand cinema,
you know I do. You’re the one who
doesn’t understand it any more.
Because you’re old, you’re tired,
you don’t know how to see the world
any more, all you know how to see
is your own death, which is waiting
right around the corner for you.
Your career’s over, Mick. I’m
telling you flat out because I love
you. No one’s interested in your
testament, as you call it, and you
risk nullifying all the beautiful
films you’ve already made. And that
would be unforgivable. It was only
because of me that they were even
going to let you make it. So by
pulling out, I’m saving your life.
And your dignity.
Mick is devastated. Completely drained. His words are
cutting.
MICK BOYLE
You’re an ingrate. And ingrate and
an idiot. Which is why you got
ahead.
But Brenda doesn’t hear his insults any more. Or maybe she
just doesn’t believe them. Regardless, she stretches out her
diamond-encrusted hand and does something extraordinary: she
caresses Mick’s cheek. Mick is on the verge of tears.
BRENDA
You’re right, Mick, that’s exactly
right.
Mick hisses between his teeth, his words full of hatred and
revenge.
MICK BOYLE
I’m going to make this film anyway.
Even without you.
Mick is crying. Brenda is still caressing his cheek.
BRENDA
Come on, Mick, life goes on. Even
without all this cinema bullshit.
Mick buries his face in his hands, destroyed.
Brenda, like the last of the great movie stars, stands up,
smooths out her dress, which has gotten a few creases in it,
grabs her thirty-thousand dollar purse, and with a regal,
dignified gait, makes her exit.

93.

61. EXT. HOTEL GARDEN. NIGHT
Spring must be coming to an end, because it’s the mime
tonight. The whole nine yards: tails, whiteface, that perfect
melancholy expression.
In a corner, the man we saw earlier, all covered in mud,
approaches Miss Universe.
MUD MAN
Do you know you are the paragon of
human beauty?
MISS UNIVERSE
Do you know I was just thinking the
same thing?
The man walks away without uttering another word.
The mime pretends to climb over an imaginary wall, but
without success.
Mick and Jimmy Tree, who has changed back in his own clothes,
are watching the performance. They’re sitting next to each
other, with Fred and Lena.
Mick is catatonic. He looks but doesn’t see, staring off into
space with a monotonous expression.
MICK BOYLE
Do you know how many actresses I’ve
worked with in my carrier?
JIMMY TREE
Lots... I guess.
MICK BOYLE
(venting) More than fifty. I
launched at least fifty actresses.
And they’ve always been grateful to
me. I... I’m a a great women’s
director.
Fred and Lena turn to look at Mick, but they can’t find the
right words or the right expression.
Jimmy Tree stares into Mick's eyes and play acts.
JIMMY TREE
“That way, Frank, that way you’ll
never forget me.” Do you remember,
Mr. Boyle?
MICK BOYLE
Of course I remember. I remember
everything I ever shot.

94.

JIMMY TREE
Mr. Boyle, you’re not a great
women’s director. You’re a great
director, period.
The mime, exhausted from not being able to climb over the
wall, crumbles to the ground and pretends to fall asleep.
Fred Ballinger is looking at the mime.
Lena is looking at her father.
The hippy mountaineer is looking at Lena.
There is a brief round of applause for the mime.
The audience begins to disperse. The evening is over. Mick,
Fred, and Lena are heading off when the voice of the boy
violinist calls out loudly, making them stop.
BOY
Mr. Ballinger.
They turn around. The boy has ascended the stage and, violin
in hand, plays the first, simple chords of Simple Song No. 3.
All he can play are the first two chords, but he’s gotten a
lot better. He plays them well and, even though he can only
repeat them, their sweetness has the power to move anyone who
listens.
Everyone is hypnotized by the child's simple playing. Jimmy
Tree, Mark Kozelek and his friends, the mountaineer, Lena,
the South American and his wife, the German couple, all the
elderly guests and their caretakers, the vulgar Russians, and
the black family, Frances and her mother, the waiters and the
doctor, the hotel manager and the cooks: it’s as if time were
standing still, like in a fairy tale where every, stars and
extras, join together.
But only one person is truly moved by those simple violin
notes. And it’s not Fred Ballinger, it’s Mick Boyle. He has
tears in his eyes.
And only Fred Ballinger, of all the people there, has noticed
that Mick is moved. Fred looks at him impassively.
61A. INT. HOTEL GYM. NIGHT
Lena, in a beautiful evening dress, stands at the foot of the
free-climbing wall, scrutinizing the height of the fake rock
face.
The mountaineer must have followed her because he’s coming up
behind her now. He approaches warily, intimidated, he’s
almost reached her.

95.

A bundle of nerves and embarrassment, he adjusts his shirt,
surreptitiously straightens his hair, and then appears at her
side. Lena doesn’t even look at him, as if he didn’t exist.
He delivers an awkward opener.
MOUNTAINEER
Would you like to try to climb?
Only at this point does Lena suddenly turn toward him. She
pierces him with a look that could not be more sensual, and
then addresses him in a serious, husky voice.
LENA
Do you know that I can make a man
go wild in bed if I want?
The mountaineer, as though it were the only natural thing to
do, looks up, goes white as milk, and falls to the ground in
a faint. A loud thud.
Lena immediately abandons the role of the "femme fatale" and
becomes the apprehensive friend. She exclaims to herself.
LENA (CONT’D)
Oh, fucking hell!
She leans over the mountaineer lying on the floor. She slaps
his cheeks to revive him. She’s scared.
LENA (CONT’D)
Sir, sir! Wake up, fuck!
Slowly the mountaineer comes to. He opens his eyes and sees
Lena's worried face a few inches from his.
In a faint voice, the mountaineer says.
MOUNTAINEER
It takes a lot less for you to make
a man go wild.
Lena smiles, relieved.
61B. INT. HOTEL LOBBY. NIGHT
The chubby hooker sits alone on a couch, looking sad. The
lobby is deserted. Mick appears behind her and, without
mincing his words, says.
MICK BOYLE
Okay, I've made up my mind, I went
to the ATM.
The hooker turns to look at him.
HOOKER
And what would you want to do?

96.

MICK BOYLE
(serious) Go for a walk.
61C. EXT. HOTEL GARDEN. NIGHT
Mick Boyle and the unattractive hooker stroll hand in hand,
like new lovers, through the garden with its centuries-old
trees.
That’s all they do. They don’t even look at each other as
they walk slowly, hand in hand.
While on a secluded bench, the two screenwriters suspected of
falling in love are, in fact, in love. They kiss with that
intensity of first kisses. Endless, exhausting kisses. All of
a sudden, the female screenwriter, without stopping kissing,
sees Mick and the young lady out of the corner of her eye.
62. EXT. MOUNTAIN VILLAGE. TRAIN STATION. DAY
The small train station in this mountain village.
Mick Boyle and the five screenwriters, all of them blue, sit
side by side on a bench on the platform, waiting for the
train. The two lovers are holding hands.
After a silence, Mick breaks the ice.
MICK BOYLE
Come on, kids, what’s with the long
faces? Hitches, delays in
screening, these things are
constants in our line of work. Get
used to it. I’ve already talked
with the producer, we just need a
little time to come up with another
actress and then the shooting
starts. It’s just a matter of
waiting a few more months.
INTELLECTUAL SCREENWRITER
What a bitch that Brenda Morel is.
MICK BOYLE
Don't talk like that about Brenda
Morel.
SCREENWRITER IN LOVE
She goes where the wind blows.
MICK BOYLE
Which is what we all do. And it's
what you all will do, in order to
survive in this jungle.

97.

SHY SCREENWRITER
It's not true that she came to
Europe specially to meet you, Mick.
I read that she's going to Cannes,
some charity ball at the Film
Festival.
The other screenwriters throw him dirty looks.
MICK BOYLE
Let's not get carried away with all
this truth, now. Remember that
fiction is our passion.
FUNNY SCREENWRITER
Your film-testament is worth a
whole lot more than one more TV
series, Mick.
MICK BOYLE
My film-testament!? Let's not
overrate things. Most men die not
only without a testament, but
without anyone even noticing.
INTELLECTUAL SCREENWRITER
Most men aren’t great artists like
you.
MICK BOYLE
It makes no difference. Men,
artists, animals, plants - we're
all just extras.
The train has arrived. The doors open. The screenwriters grab
their backpacks and start boarding the train. The last to
climb aboard is the female screenwriter who hasn’t yet said a
word. Mick stays on the platform, watching them. Just before
the door closes, she turns to Mick and, with a beautiful
smile, says.
FEMALE SCREENWRITER
He’s on his deathbed, and he dies.
Only then does she say - and for
the first time - "I love you,
Michael."
Mick smiles, moved.
MICK BOYLE
Perfect!
The door closes. The train pulls away and disappears around a
bend. Mick, sad now, turns and leaves the station.

98.

63. EXT. COUNTRY LANE. DAY
Mick, alone and disappointed, shuffles along the same country
lane. He’s all alone. It’s a glorious day. Brilliant sun.
Blue sky. Crisp air. Chirping cicadas. A paradise.
A woman’s voice, as if it were coming from nowhere, calls
him.
WOMAN’S VOICE
Mick.
Mick turns to his left, where there is an immense
uncultivated field, the grass three feet high. He looks, but
can’t see anyone. But then, a woman dressed like a 1950s
stewardess materializes out of the grass. It was she who
called him, and now she adds anxiously.
STEWARDESS
How am I supposed to say this line,
Mick? I don’t get it.
Mick doesn’t even have time to respond before another woman she looks like a young Jean Seberg - pops up from the grass,
wearing a bikini. She sounds as if she is reciting a line
from a film, in an ostentatious, snobby voice.
GIRL IN BIKINI
You may not know, James, that I
never even step foot on a yacht
that is less then 80 feet.
Next a ditsy blond with abundant curves, 1960s style, appears
out of the grass, and starts reciting.
DITSY BLOND
Come on, guys, where did you hide
my lilac slippers? Enough already.
Mick watches and smiles radiantly.
Now a pious looking, middle-aged woman pops up and recites
emotionally, on the verge of tears.
PIOUS WOMAN
Oh Albert, if only you knew how
much it has cost me to guard my
virginity all these years, until
today, until I met you!
A magnificent countess in a nineteenth-century gown rises up
out of the grass.

99.

COUNTESS
Prince, I am the owner of six
castles and twenty carriages, but
there is only one thing I can
declare with certainty: life is so
tiresome.
And now a woman in the militant dress of 1968.
1968ER
Sure, we all want a revolution, as
long as it doesn’t tire us out too
much.
Mick looks happily at all his actresses, one by one, as they
recite lines from his films.
Another woman appears, about thirty-five, her back to us,
long, flowing red hair and bare shoulders. She turns to the
camera: a fabulous, authentic diva, dripping with allure. She
gives a sensual, nostalgic performance.
DIVA
Okay, you win, I’ll go to bed with
you, but on one condition. That you
don’t come. That way, Frank, that
way you’ll never forget me.
One after another all of Mick’s actresses appear, popping up
out of the grass. Each one recites a line. The ones that have
been standing for a while just keep repeating the same line,
in a quieter voice.
In short, that field becomes a garden of actresses - all
types, all ages and eras, in all sorts of costumes (a
soldier, a little old lady, a drag queen, a vamp, a singer, a
gymnast, a ballerina with a tutu, etc.), all reciting their
lines for Mick.
The whining stewardess again.
STEWARDESS
How do you want it, Mick? Sincere,
smug, wicked? And my walk? How’s my
character supposed to move?
Mick is about to reply when yet another actress pops up and
steals his attention. More than all the others, this one
really shakes him up. He blurts out.
MICK BOYLE
Mommy.
All the other actresses fall silent, leaving the stage to
this last actress.

100.

It’s Brenda Morel, in costume: a cheap, ugly dressing gown,
decrepit, a pale shadow of her former beauty. She recites in
a neutral voice.
BRENDA
You were so cute when you were
little, my boy. But what’s so
disgraceful is that you’re still
cute. A cute, useless man.
Mick’s eyes are shining. The silence of the empty field.
There’s no one there. The vision is over.
64. INT. FRED BALLINGER’S SUITE. DAY
Fred and Mick are in Fred’s bedroom.
Fred in the armchair, Mick on the edge of the bed. Mick is
looking out the window. Calm and disappointed. Fred eyes him,
knowing what a difficult moment this is for his friend.
FRED BALLINGER
So you talked to the producer?
Mick turns and looks at Fred.
MICK BOYLE
I’ve been in this business too long
not to know that without Brenda,
this film is never going to be
made.
Silence. Mick reflects.
Then Mick turns his gaze to Fred’s night stand. He looks at
the photograph of Fred and his wife hugging ten years
earlier. Old, but happy. And beautiful.
MICK BOYLE (CONT’D)
Melanie is so beautiful in that
picture.
FRED BALLINGER
You’re right, she is beautiful.
MICK BOYLE
You know, I’ve come to realize
something, Fred. People are either
beautiful or ugly. The ones in
between are merely cute.
Fred smiles bitterly. So does Mick.
MICK BOYLE (CONT’D)
So... another vacation almost over.
What will you do next, Fred?

101.

FRED BALLINGER
What am I supposed to do? I’ll go
home, the usual routine.
MICK BOYLE
Not me. I don’t do routine. You
know what I’m going to do, Fred?
I’m going to start on another film.
You say that emotions are
overrated, but that's bullshit.
Emotions are all we have.
Then Mick gets up, goes over to the glass door, opens it,
steps onto the balcony, and, with remarkable simplicity, puts
one foot on the wicker chair, the other on the railing, and
lets himself fall from the fifth floor.
Fred barely has time to stand up. Mick was so swift and so
unpredictable, he didn’t give his friend time to do anything
to save him.
65. INT. AIRPLANE. DAY
The Boeing sits on the runway. In the background, the
mountains.
In a LONG SHOT from the back of the plane, we watch the
entire take off. The plane is full. We can see the back of
everybody’s necks from this angle.
A stewardess strolls down the aisle. She turns politely to a
distinguished looking man.
STEWARDESS
Excuse me, sir, but you’ll have to
switch off your cell phone.
The LONG SHOT continues.
All of a sudden, from the other end of the plane - from
business class, which is separated by a little curtain from
where we are - comes a hoarse, monstrous cry. It goes on and
on, a broken, bloodcurdling sound.
All the passengers stretch their necks toward the little
curtain, surprised. The stewardess dashes at full speed
toward business class.
The camera begins a long, slow tracking shot down the aisle
toward business class.
As the dolly moves, the monstrous, deranged screams, which
seem to be those of a woman, echo throughout the cabin. More
female cries, and the sound of a scuffle.
The camera has arrived at the little curtain. It makes its
way under it and enters business class.

102.

The screams still persist, but they’re fading now.
By now all the passengers are on their feet, gawking.
The camera elbows its way to the passageway in front of the
cockpit and the exit door.
We hear a jumble of confused voices, a muffled moan, and an
incomprehensible commotion.
The camera has arrived at the center of the action: five
stewardesses, done in by the physical strain, are literally
immobilizing someone on the floor. One of them has a bloody
lip.
The camera goes to find out who it is, moaning and shaking
feebly.
It’s Brenda Morel stretched out there on the floor of the
plane, deranged, her torn dress riding up, revealing an old
lady’s flesh-colored slip, her make-up smudged, her face
barely recognizable, disfigured by pain and tears, her words
fragmented and incomprehensible, frightening.
She is bald. Her wig must have fallen off in the scuffle with
the stewardesses.
A close-up of Brenda’s face. We now realize what she is
saying. Exhausted but determined, she keeps mumbling to the
stewardesses who are holding her down.
BRENDA
Let me off, you fucking bitches,
let me off this damn plane
immediately.
The pilot comes out of the cockpit, breathless. He speaks to
Brenda.
PILOT
Okay, lady, you win. I just got
clearance from the control tower.
We’re going to let you off now.
66. EXT. HILL. DAY
Scattered across the hill, the usual cows with their bells
ringing randomly.
Fred is sitting on a rock facing them. He watches the
animals, his face blank.
Then he closes his eyes. The camera zooms in slowly. Fred
moves his arm, as if directing an orchestra, but this time
nothing happens.
The cowbells keep ringing in random, anarchic fashion.

103.

Fred, his eyes still closed, makes a vexed gesture. He moves
his arm more energetically this time, but still nothing. He
can’t seem to concentrate and compose in his mind.
He is in need of music, but music no longer has need of him.
He opens his eyes. The cows are still there, in front of him.
And in a loud voice he issues a command, a pretty stupid
thing to say to a bunch of cows.
FRED BALLINGER
Be quiet.
But the cows and their cowbells ignore him.
Fred drops his head slightly. He’s exhausted. His eyes shine
with grief.
Then, something surprising happens. Without any warning, a
parachutist lands silently in the middle of the cows.
Fred looks at him. The parachute collapses on top of the man,
covering him completely.
He struggles to free himself, then looks around in surprise
and realizes he has landed in the wrong place, right in the
middle of a herd of cows.
He looks at Fred and says calmly.
PARACHUTIST
I don’t think this was where I was
supposed to land.
And, without waiting for a reply, he heads off across the
hill.
As Fred watches him, his eyes still wet with tears, he
smiles.
67. INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE. DAY
A magnificent bow window that looks out onto the mountains,
with an antique wooden birdcage. It’s a gorgeous, round
structure, with a magnificent blackbird inside.
The bird is chirping a simple, perfect song.
We are in the office of the sixty-year-old doctor. He is
standing behind his desk, staring with dismay and concern at
Fred Ballinger, who is sitting on the other side of the desk,
ecstatically contemplating the singing blackbird.
The doctor beings in a tactful voice.

104.

DOCTOR
Will you be going to Los Angeles
for the funer-Fred interrupts him.
FRED BALLINGER
Ssshhhh!
The doctor falls silent.
Fred, his face vacant, stands up and shuffles over to the
window, to hear the bird’s song up close.
The doctor too turns and looks at the bird, which suddenly and for no apparent reason - stops singing.
Fred turns to the doctor and says, all in one go.
FRED BALLINGER (CONT’D)
Birds are such artists! No, I’m not
going to Los Angeles. I’m not going
to Mick Boyle’s funeral. And I
won’t come back here on holiday
either. Because it’s absolutely
pointless to return to the places
where you have been happy. Because
you have to learn how to look
everything else in the face.
The doctor nods sadly.
FRED BALLINGER (CONT’D)
Why exactly did you call me in
here, doctor? What is it you wanted
to tell me?
The doctor sits on his desk. He picks up a medical file and
opens it.
DOCTOR
I have the results of all the checkups you’ve been doing during your
holiday.
FRED BALLINGER
And what do they say?
DOCTOR
You’re as healthy as a horse, Mr.
Ballinger.
Fred, hopeful almost, asks.
FRED BALLINGER
My prostate at least?
The doctor is surprised.

105.

DOCTOR
Your prostate? You’ve never had a
problem with your prostate. And if
you haven’t had any problems so
far, you’re certainly not going to
start having them now.
Fred looks up at the doctor. Completely unexpectedly, he
smiles. And says.
FRED BALLINGER
So I’ve grown old, but without
understanding how I got here.
The doctor gives him a sad smile.
Fred turns and looks out the window. In the distance, he
spots the young masseuse who is quickly crossing the hotel
garden in her white work smock. She moves quickly and
gracefully, and Fred watches her with that same tinge of
melancholy, while the doctor says to him.
DOCTOR
So... do you know what awaits you
outside of here?
FRED BALLINGER
No, doctor, what?
DOCTOR
(smiles) Youth.
The doctor reflects for a moment, growing sad.
DOCTOR (CONT’D)
Mick Boyle used to come by pretty
often for a chat.
Fred watches the masseuse disappear behind a row of trees and
jump into the pool. Then he asks the doctor.
FRED BALLINGER
By any chance, did he ever tell you
anything about Gilda Black?
DOCTOR
He never talked about anything
else.
Fred’s ears perk up. He’s consumed by curiosity. But he tries
to hide it, in order to get the answers he is after.
FRED BALLINGER
Was she his girlfriend?

106.

DOCTOR
“Girlfriend” is way too much. The
only thing that ever happened was
one time, when they were kids, they
held hands and walked together for
a few yards in some park.
Fred smiles to himself.
DOCTOR (CONT’D)
He used to call it "The moment I
learned to ride a bike." Didn’t he
ever tell you about it?
FRED BALLINGER
No. We only ever told each other
the good things.
68. EXT. VENICE.(VARIOUS SETTINGS). NIGHT
Venice is so beautiful. And mysterious. And unique.
Especially at night, when the city is still, deserted,
abandoned seeming, when even the most diehard tourists have
fallen into the arms of Morpheus.
Canals, narrow streets, Saint Mark’s Square. Everything
unmoving and statuesque.
But then he appears. In the distance, small and vulnerable,
with that tiny, old-man shuffle of his. And flowers, he’s
carrying flowers. It’s Fred Ballinger. He’s walking all by
himself through this mysterious city. He crosses a small
bridge. A motorboat glides underneath, not making a sound.
68A. EXT. CEMETERY. DAWN
A speedboat-taxi skirts the walls of the cemetery. Fred
Ballinger sits onboard, serious and tired, staring into the
void, the flowers in his lap.
In the cemetery, he crosses the long avenues dotted with
tombs. He’s looking for someone. He approaches a few tombs,
but can’t remember. And besides, he doesn’t have much of a
sense of direction.
There, he’s finally found it. He stands in front of the tomb
of Igor Stravinsky. But he keeps holding the flowers firmly
in his hands.
68B. EXT. VENICE. (VARIOUS SETTINGS). DAY
Fred knows the way now. He shuffles along a narrow street
that borders a canal. He turns a corner and stops. He looks
up sadly and sees the sign for a private clinic.

107.

69. INT. CLINIC. PRIVATE ROOM. DAY
Fred, flowers in hand, stands in a room of the clinic. A
sober, private room. And he looks. He’s looking at a bed near
the window where we see from behind an elderly woman,
motionless, her hair loose, her forehead leaning against the
window.
Fred plucks up his courage and arranges the
small plastic vase on the night stand. Then
photo he had in the hotel out of his pocket
next to the flowers. He sits down near her,

flowers in a
he pulls the
and places it
his back to her.

He looks at the floor and, filled with an unusual shyness, he
says.
FRED BALLINGER
I waited till it was visiting hours
to come see you.
Fred stares at the woman's back under the sheet.
Fred is expressionless.
There is no noise.
Then, without emotion, without any intonation, Fred begins to
talk, in a simple, unhurried manner.
FRED BALLINGER (CONT’D)
They don’t know, Melanie. Children
can’t know their parents’ ordeals.
Sure, they know certain details,
the most striking elements, those
they know. They know what they need
to know in order to side with one
or the other. They need to simplify
things. And they’re right. But they
don’t know. They can’t know. They
don’t know how I trembled the first
time I saw you on that stage. And
the orchestra laughing behind my
back at my falling in love, at my
unexpected fragility. They don’t
know that you sold your mother’s
jewelry so I could finish my second
piece, when everyone was turning me
down and saying I was a
presumptuous, inelegant musician.
They don’t know that you too - and
you were right - thought at the
time that I was a presumptuous,
inelegant musician, and you cried
nonstop, not because you had sold
your mother’s jewels but because
you had sold your mother. They
don’t know how you loved me, and
how I loved you. Only we know that.
(MORE)

108.
FRED BALLINGER (CONT’D)
They don’t know what we were
together, you and I, despite
everything. And that “despite
everything” that was so exhausting,
so painful, so hard. Melanie, they
can never know that we two, despite
everything, liked to think of
ourselves as a simple song.

He’s done. He gets up from his chair and stands on his toes,
as if trying to see his wife’s face, but he gives up
immediately. He can’t handle it emotionally. So he simply
stretches out his hand and moves his wife’s arm few inches,
so that it is in what he hopes is a more comfortable
position.
70. EXT. VENICE. HOSPITAL. NIGHT
Fred leaves the hospital. He walks toward the camera until we
have a close up of his face. Behind him, on the mezzanine, we
glimpse Fred’s wife, her forehead leaning against the glass
and her mouth open.
But only a glimpse, because from here she seems so far away.
Fred stands still and reflects. He starts to turn around, to
look back at his wife, but he can’t bring himself to. He
desists and looks straight ahead again. Then he takes a candy
from his pocket, unwraps it, and pops it in his mouth.
He tries again to turn toward his wife, who is still there,
far away, behind the glass, as if she were watching him
instead of merely staring at nothing. But once again, Fred
doesn’t have the courage to look her in the face. He holds
the candy wrapper between his fingers, but this time he
doesn’t rub it. He throws it in the canal in front of him.
Tired and tested, Fred reflects. And as he does so, in a
close up shot, the violin from “Simple Song No.3” begins to
sound, but this time, we sense right away, it is played by a
violin virtuoso, not a boy just starting out.
71. INT. THEATER. EVENING
Absolute silence, two empty chairs with gold trim.
An elegantly dressed audience has filled the theater.
Without warning, without any signal, the entire audience
rises to its feet in eerie silence. Two individuals have
entered the theater. We catch a glimpse of them through the
backdrop of people. Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip.
They sit in the gold trimmed chairs. We see their royal
outlines backlit by the lights of the stage.

109.

The audience can sit down again.
A violin virtuoso plays the opening bars of “Simple Song
No.3”. Adagio, moderate volume.
Prince Philip, in a backlit shot, his eyes full of joy,
expectant and excited. The eyes of a child.
On the stage, the great South Korean soprano, Sumi Jo,
swallows secretly, overcome with panic and emotion. She gets
ready to sing.
Backlit, Queen Elizabeth glances at her consort and is happy.
The Queen’s emissary, in the back of a box, observes from
afar the happy Queen and Prince Philip, but he is still a
ball of tension.
Sumi Jo opens her mouth wide and practically knocks the house
down when she breaks into a perfect, heart-rending love song.
The large audience of extremely elegant guests jumps out of
their chairs slightly, as if hypnotized by the soprano’s
voice.
Sumi Jo’s high note is over. It didn’t last long.
Fred Ballinger, concentrating intensely, in perfect control
of himself, gracefully waves his baton, and the entire
orchestra joins in. Strings and wind instruments play in
unison, the music rises, and the whole audience gets goose
bumps.
Jimmy Tree is there, alone, without any of his friends. He
leans forward slowly on his chair; his eyes shine with
childlike excitement.
It’s beautiful, this plaintive Simple Song No.3 as it
unfolds...
72. EXT. MOUNTAIN CLIFF. DAY
... close ups of Lena and the hippy mountaineer. Very close
together. Close enough to kiss, if she weren’t trembling so
much.
He laughs, like a moron. They’re so close. Then he stops
laughing. He looks at her. He holds her close. She stops
trembling. She looks at him.
We know they will kiss, but not now.
The camera zooms out.

110.

Lena and the mountaineer are hanging in mid-air at ten
thousand feet. Nothing below them. She clinging to him. Kept
alive by a rope and some carabiners.
73. INT. THEATER. EVENING
Fred waves his arm and the strings and winds grow fainter,
until they finally disappear. Just the violin now.
Fred looks at Sumi Jo. He signals with his eyes for her to
come in.
Sumi Jo opens her mouth again, another clamorous, long,
perfect high note.
Fred can’t help but stare at the Japanese soprano as she
delivers that extraordinary sound.
And she looks at him.
Fred keeps looking at her, but it’s as if he is seeing
someone else...
74. EXT. VENICE. HOSPITAL. DAY
... as if he’s seeing her. His wife Melanie.
Sumi Jo’s high note continues in this scene.
The camera zooms in slowly on the hospital mezzanine. A close
up of Melanie. Her loose white hair, her face ravaged by
disease, her eyes lost in an abyss, and her mouth open, as if
she were singing.
75. INT. THEATER. EVENING
A close-up of Sumi Jo, mouth open, still hitting that high
note.
Fred Ballinger looks at her, skillfully hiding any emotion.
Sumi Jo looks at Fred Ballinger. She waits. And, at the crisp
closing of his hand, she suddenly, skillfully, ends that
crazy high note.
The orchestra moves to the conclusion.
With a sharp, clear movement of his wand, Fred Ballinger
brings the music to a close.
The orchestra stops.
Absolute silence. The world has stopped spinning.

111.

The Queen’s emissary lets out a huge sigh of relief. It’s
over.
Jimmy Tree is sitting upright in his chair, his mouth halfopen, as if suspended in astonishment and excitement. He
waits to see what will happen next.
Slowly, with learned gestures, Fred Ballinger turns toward
the audience. No self-satisfaction, at least not now.
He is impassive, a sphinx, a professional. Yes, that’s what
he is, a professional.
The members of the audience fan out below him. Their eyes
wet, deeply moved.
Fred Ballinger, imperturbable, waits for them to recover from
the emotion. He knows that they need a few more seconds for
emotion to give way to applause.
We know they will applaud, but not now. Not yet.
And in the silence, FADE TO BLACK.
Slowly, calmly, the closing credits begin.
