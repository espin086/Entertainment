EXT. TOLL GATE, NORCOMBE HILL - DAY

1

A day in LATE AUGUST. A FIGURE on a hill top; the unpopulated
landscape - lush in summer, barren and bleak in winter curving down to high chalk cliffs with the ocean beyond.
GABRIEL OAK sits watching over his flock with his two DOGS,
his face handsome if somewhat weather-beaten beneath a lowcrowned felt hat. He has a quality of contentment, calm and
stillness. Idly, he plays with a stone in his hand. No sound
but the sounds of nature.
Which is why his eye is drawn towards the horizon, the sound
of wheels. A CART is approaching. Curious GABRIEL rises and
walks closer, as the CART stops at a toll gate and the OLD
WAGGONER gets down.

EXT. TOLL GATE, NORCOMBE HILL - DAY

From GABRIEL’s p.o.v, an argument has broken out with the
TURNPIKE KEEPER.
WAGGONER
Misses says she won’t pay more.
TURNPIKE KEEPER
Then Misses’d best turn back. Price
is thrupence.
The WAGGONER sighs, and goes to negotiate with his PASSENGER,
as yet unseen. GABRIEL steps closer.
WAGGONER
Perhaps best to pay him. Be dark
soon.
She replies - barely heard. The WAGGONER returns.
WAGGONER (CONT’D)
She says she’s paid you quite
enough.
TURNPIKE KEEPER
Three pence.
A stand-off. Until GABRIEL arrives. He knows the GATEKEEPER.
A local.

GABRIEL
Let her through. It’s a woman on
her own.

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

Going through the gate, BATHSHEBA EVERDENE very briefly turns
to GABRIEL. If she feels gratitude, she can’t quite bring
herself to express it. Pride wins out. The cart moves on.

TITLES - ‘FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD.’
Under TITLES, a series of Wessex landscapes.

- CARROW COVE on a brisk autumn day, the low sun glinting on
the sea.
- the CLIFFS of NORCOMBE HILL facing out into the sea in the
grip of a winter storm.
- the RIVER AXE in full flow with the melting snows of
spring.
- bleak EGDON HEATH in the rain, the road seeming to stretch
on forever.
- the gloom of the GREAT FOREST, dark in its depths even on
the brightest summer day.
- the mud and stone of ploughed fields in the VALE of
BLACKMORE, awaiting planting in March.
This is the stage for our story, quite remote from the rest
of the world. A grand landscape, sometimes beautiful,
sometimes harsh - and finally, the slope of NORCOMBE HILL on a day in LATE
SEPTEMBER.

LATE SEPTEMBER. A chink of light opens out as the stable door
is pulled open. BATHSHEBA is silhouetted against the bright
light.

EXT. MRS HURST’S COTTAGE - DAWN

BATHSHEBA leads the horse into the yard of MRS HURST’s farm;
small, subsistence-level but tidy and well-kept, clinging to
the side of the remote hill.
We see her face as she greets the horse; a startlingly vivid
face, full of spirit and determination. She rides off.

- heading down to the forest that borders the hill.

EXT. COUNTRY LANE - DAY

BATHSHEBA finds herself in a hollow-way, a path covered by a
canopy of trees, too low for rider and horse to pass beneath.
She looks one way, then the other, to ensure that she’s alone
then, in a single dextrous movement, then switches from sidesaddle to cross-saddle, tucking her dress up - some sort of
trousers or breaches revealed beneath. Comfortable now, she
lies backwards along the horse so that her head is near its
tail, her feet near its shoulders, her eyes to the sky. It’s
an impressive performance, almost a circus trick, and she
smiles in satisfaction to herself as the horse trots forward,
the sky showing between the low boughs.
On the ground behind her, a SCARF.

- towards a high vantage point. The panorama is magnificent
and she smiles to herself.
She urges the horse on, a wonderful rider, riding past
GABRIEL without even stopping.

INT. GABRIEL’S COTTAGE,- NIGHT

7B

The SCARF again, but now it lies on the table of GABRIEL
OAK’s cottage, a neat, comfortable place.
GABRIEL sits nearby, counting out money which he locks away
in a strong box. He closes his money box.
His eye returns to the SCARF 8

EXT. GABRIEL’S COTTAGE - DAY

Another day. From his high vantage point, GABRIEL with his
sheep and dogs, behind him his cottage.
He sees BATHSHEBA walking by, below.
GABRIEL
Miss!
In his hand, the lost SCARF. He stays proudly on top of the
hill, so she has to climb the hill towards him. He hands her
the scarf.

BATHSHEBA
(out of breath)
My scarf. I lost it. You must be
Farmer Oak.
(surprise from GABRIEL)
This is your land, I must be
trespassing.
GABRIEL
You’re welcome here. Gabriel. And
you are...?
BATHSHEBA
I’d rather not tell you. It’s a
very odd name, I try not to say it
out loud.
GABRIEL
I’m sure you could get a new one.
If you wanted.
(An awkward moment, a
misfire. She takes the
scarf -)
Forgive me, I can’t always..map my
mind on my tongue.
BATHSHEBA
Thank you. Farmer Oak.
On BATHSHEBA as she walks away, a small smile appearing.
8A

EXT. MRS HURST’S FARM, NORCOMBE HILL - DAY

8A

BATHSHEBA is milking the cows. GABRIEL is herding his sheep
nearby, heading up to the small SHEPHERD’S HUT, a kind of
CARAVAN from where he guards the sheep.
A greeting between them. She steps out and looks after him.
The ice melting 8B

EXT. GABRIEL’S CARAVAN, NORCOMBE HILL - DAY

8B

GABRIEL has two dogs, YOUNG GEORGE who barks and nips at the
flock, and OLD GEORGE who sits contentedly by BATHSHEBA.
A new development. BATHSHEBA watches GABRIEL go about his
work with some admiration. GABRIEL, for his part, is showing
off a little.
GABRIEL
Come by, George. Come!
(Returning to BATHSHEBA)
He’s keen enough, Young George, but
he doesn’t know when to stop.
(petting OLD GEORGE)

GABRIEL (CONT'D)
Not like this one. Been with me a
long time, haven’t you?
BATHSHEBA
And what’s that one called?
GABRIEL
This is Old George.
BATHSHEBA
(she laughs)
Of course. Old George.
And GABRIEL walks away towards his caravan.
GABRIEL
Find me amusing, do you?

EXT. NORCOMBE HILL - NIGHT

BATHSHEBA is out riding once more. She stops. It’s a
beautiful night, the stars framing her, steam rising from the
horse. From somewhere in the distance, the sound of dogs
barking.
Some distance away stands GABRIEL’s hut, the small building
on wheels that he uses for shelter when watching the flock at
night. Smoke rises from the chimney.
But something is amiss.
We follow her towards the caravan. She knocks on the door no answer. She goes in and finds 10

INT. GABRIEL’S CARAVAN, NORCOMBE HILL - NIGHT

GABRIEL lies unconscious in the smoky interior. BATHSHEBA
takes in the scene then leaps into action. With all her
strength, she drags him upright, slaps his face.
BATHSHEBA
Mr Oak! Mr Oak, wake up! Gabriel
Oak!
Nothing. Now she tries to haul him to her feet. But he falls,
a dead-weight, across her lap. This is all new to BATHSHEBA.
A man in her lap. She takes it in. To her side, a jug of
milk. She takes it, throws it into his face.
Gasping, dazed and confused he comes round. Looks up, sees
her face. She laughs with relief. GABRIEL is confused,
breathless.
GABRIEL
What’s the matter? What is it?

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

BATHSHEBA
Nothing, since you’re not dead. I
was heading home when I heard the
dogs barking.
(she busies herself,
ventilating the hut)
It’s very foolish of you, Farmer.
Oak. My uncle had a hut just like
this, I used to play in it as a
little girl and he told me, always,
always keep a window open or you’ll
suffocate.
( - the wetness - )
I’m sorry about the milk. At least
it was warm.
(he attempts to stand,
stumbles. Takes her HAND)
Rest a moment. You know, Farmer
Oak, I think I may have saved your
life.
Her hand in his, as GABRIEL steadies himself.
GABRIEL
Tell me your name. I still don’t
know your name.
BATHSHEBA
Then find it out. My hand, Mr Oak?
Somewhat reluctantly, he lets go of her hand. She walks out
into the night.
GABRIEL sits on the steps and watches her go.
11

EXT. GABRIEL’S CARAVAN, NORCOMBE HILL - DAY

Next morning. GABRIEL is working his sheep, but his mind is
elsewhere. He stops working, his mind wandering.
12

INT. GABRIEL’S CARAVAN, NORCOMBE HILL - DAY

12

GABRIEL polishes his boots, puts away his working clothes. A
decision has been made.
13

EXT. GABRIEL’S CARAVAN, NORCOMBE HILL - DAY

GABRIEL walks through his flock and finds a lamb. It has come
weeks early, and is the only one. He scoops the tiny thing
up.

EXT. MRS HURST’S COTTAGE - DAY

14

Accompanied by OLD GEORGE, carrying the lamb, GABRIEL marches
towards MRS HURST’s, a man with a mission.
Middle-aged, wry and weather-worn, MRS HURST joins her niece
in clearing brambles from the cottage garden. Tough work,
BATHSHEBA scratched and muddy.
MRS HURST stretches out her back and notices GABRIEL
approaching.
MRS HURST
Goodness. Mr Oak.
BATHSHEBA
What does he want?
15

INT. KITCHEN, MRS HURST’S COTTAGE - DAY

15

BATHSHEBA washes the mud from her hands, wipes it from her
face, checks her reflection in the small mirror. It will have
to do.
16

INT. PARLOUR, MRS HURST’S COTTAGE - CONTINUOUS

16

GABRIEL and MRS HURST sit in the parlour, a little awkward.
BATHSHEBA enters, and he stands abruptly.
GABRIEL
Miss Everdene. Bathsheba. I’ve
brought you a lamb.
BATHSHEBA
(delighted)
Thank you, Farmer Oak! Such a dear
thing, that’s very sweet of you.
GABRIEL
He’s come too soon and won’t last
the winter. I thought you’d like to
rear it instead.
BATHSHEBA
Thank you. That’s very kind.
MRS HURST takes the lamb out with her.
MRS HURST
I’ll make some tea.
And she makes her exit. Silence.
GABRIEL
The lamb is not why I came.

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

BATHSHEBA
Go on.
GABRIEL
Well...I wanted to ask, Miss
Everdene, if you’d marry me.
A long moment.
BATHSHEBA
Oh This is not the response he wanted GABRIEL
I’ve never asked anyone before.
BATHSHEBA
No, I And impulsively he stands.
GABRIEL
Well. I’ll leave you now.
BATHSHEBA
Mr Oak (he turns, waits)
There are things to consider.
GABRIEL
Someone waiting for you?
BATHSHEBA
No, there’s no-one else but that
doesn’t mean I’ll marry you.
GABRIEL
Good day to you then.
17

EXT. MRS HURST’S COTTAGE - CONTINUOUS
BATHSHEBA follows him out.
BATHSHEBA
Mr Oak, stop! I didn’t say I
wouldn’t marry you either!
(he doesn’t understand which is it?)
I really haven’t ever thought about
it. I need time to consider.

17

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

GABRIEL
But I know I can make you happy.
(she’s thrown by this)
I have one hundred acres, two
hundred sheep, When I pay off the
money, the farm is ours. You could
have a piano in a year or two.
Flowers and birds. A frame for
cucumbers. A baby perhaps, or two BATHSHEBA
Please, Mr Oak, that’s too much GABRIEL
- or more. And whenever you look up
I’ll be there, and whenever I look
up there’ll be you.
BATHSHEBA takes this in, imagines it, and makes her decision.
BATHSHEBA
Mr Oak, I do not want a husband.
I’d hate to be some man’s property.
I shouldn’t mind being a bride at a
wedding, if I could be one without
getting a husband, but GABRIEL
That’s just stupid talk.
With as much calmness and compassion as she can muster;
BATHSHEBA
You are better off than I, Mr Oak.
I have an education and this dress
and nothing more. You can do much,
much better than me...
GABRIEL
Maybe that’s true. But you know
that’s not the reason.
BATHSHEBA
I’m too independent for you.
(this sounds more
plausible)
If I ever were to marry, I’d need
somebody to tame me, and you’d
never be able to do it. You’d grow
to despise me.
GABRIEL
(with quiet simplicity)
I would not.
(she takes this in.
A moment, then -)
Goodbye, Miss Everdene.

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

And with that he turns and goes.
For a moment she follows him, just a step or two. Then she
walks back to the cottage. One last look.
GABRIEL walks away, no turning back.
18

EXT. GABRIEL’S CARAVAN, NORCOMBE HILL - DAY
WINTER. Time passing.

GABRIEL is herding sheep as light snow falls. Hard, physical
work.
As night comes on, he rests on the steps of the Shepherd’s
Hut, the site of BATHSHEBA’s rescue.

INT. GABRIEL’S CARAVAN, NORCOMBE HILL - DAWN

Another day. In his caravan, OLD GEORGE by his side, GABRIEL
sleeps on.
The barking of YOUNG GEORGE wakes them both. Something is up.
He sits, listens.
The sound of sheep bells now. He is on his feet. To OLD
GEORGE GABRIEL
Stay here, old boy.
20

EXT. GABRIEL’S CARAVAN, NORCOMBE HILL - DAWN

GABRIEL steps out of the caravan, pulling on his clothes. He
listens to the distant barking to find the direction, then
runs off.
A broken fence nearby 20A

EXT. GABRIEL’S CARAVAN, NORCOMBE HILL - DAWN

20A

He walks through trees, losing track of the barking for a
moment. Coming out of the trees and forest, he crests the
hill in search of the flock.
But they have gone. Disappeared. Silence.
Then barking, the sound of the bells, further off this time.
He runs -

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

EXT. CLIFFS, NORCOMBE HILL - DAWN

21

A natural basin leads up to cliffs and, beyond that, the sea.
The precipice is fenced off, but it is towards this cliff
edge that the flock have been harried by YOUNG GEORGE.
GABRIEL stumbles across the darkened hillside after them.
...but it’s too late. The young, impetuous dog is barking and
snapping at a single remaining sheep, forcing it through a
gap in the broken fence and into the darkness beyond. The
sheep has gone.
YOUNG GEORGE runs to his master, desperate for approval. But
GABRIEL is numb. With a terrible sense of foreboding, he
walks towards the gap in the hedge, knowing already what
he’ll find.
GABRIEL’s POV. A glimpse of white below.
22

EXT. BEACH, NORCOMBE HILL - DAY

22

At the bottom of the limestone cliff, the corpses of the
flock. Two hundred sheep, all dead.
The sun is up, the water lapping at the corpses. GABRIEL
stands exhausted, numb. All of his hopes, his ambitions, the
rewards of twenty years hard work, all dead. At his side,
YOUNG GEORGE licks his hand, awaiting his reward for a job
well done.
He kneels next to YOUNG GEORGE, places his forehead against
the dog’s and speaks to him quietly.
GABRIEL
Least we didn’t marry, eh Georgie?
Then he quickly stands and, without malice but with an awful
resignation, he raises his gun.
A shot rings out.
23

INT. GABRIEL’S COTTAGE - DAY
Keys and cashbox handed to two GENTLEMAN FARMERS.
FIRST FARMER
Good luck to you, Mr Oak.
SECOND FARMER
And our sympathies.
FIRST FARMER
Where are you heading?
(no reply)
We take no pleasure in this.

GABRIEL ignores them and goes instead to OLD GEORGE.
GABRIEL
Sorry, old boy.
24

EXT. EGDON HEATH - DAY

24

Another day. GABRIEL walks on, everything he owns now in the
pack on his back.
Now snow falls. The road across Egdon Heath has disappeared.
Desperate for shelter, he sees a barn.
25

25

INT. BARN - NIGHT

GABRIEL wraps himself in his blanket and tries to sleep, his
breath hanging in the frozen air.
There’s a hole in the roof. GABRIEL looks to the skies,
thinks of BATHSHEBA 26

EXT. MRS HURST’S FARM - DAY

26

MRS HURST
Bathsheba!
A shout. BATHSHEBA, working in the fields, stands. MRS HURST
runs towards her, waving something in her hand.
BATHSHEBA
What is it?
A letter. She hands it to BATHSHEBA, breathless. Gasping for
air MRS HURST
Oh my love, it’s your poor Uncle’s
will.
BATHSHEBA
What does it say? What’s happened?
Breathless, MRS HURST indicates.
MRS HURST
Read it! Read!
BATHSHEBA does so BATHSHEBA puts her hand to her mouth. Then she embraces her
AUNT.

The cart is loaded with suitcases and furniture. In her city
dress once more, BATHSHEBA says farewell - then clambers aboard, and finds a place amongst the
precarious load.
The cart trundles off, BATHSHEBA turning and waving goodbye.
Excitement, anticipation. On her lap, the lamb. GABRIEL’s
gift.
The blare of a trumpet and 28

CLOSE on SERGEANT FRANCIS TROY of the 11th DRAGOON GUARDS.
Fine-boned, a neatly-trimmed moustache on a finely structured
face.
The DRAGOONS are a splendid sight, a blaze of brass and
scarlet on a January day.
They ride towards the market town of CASTERBRIDGE
29

EXT. TOWN SQUARE, CASTERBRIDGE - DAY

29

The GUARDS are holding an opportunistic recruiting drive. As
TROY and the other troops stand at ease SERGEANT DOGGETT,
attempts to muster new recruits.
SERGEANT DOGGETT
So who’ll join us, lads? Which of
you fine boys’ll put on the scarlet
uniform and proudly serve his Queen
and Country?...
In amongst the crowd, a YOUNG WOMAN. She’s in her best dress,
but painfully under-dressed for the cold weather. She’s also
encumbered by a large, impractical carpet bag. Nevertheless,
there’s a kind of elation about her, as if she’s embarking on
some adventure. An escape. This is FANNY ROBBIN.
She pushes through the crowd towards the front, finding
herself next to GABRIEL OAK; gaunt now, exhausted.
FANNY ROBBIN
Frank! Over here! Frank, it’s
Fanny!
TROY gives her a quick, fond glance, then fixes his eyes
forward again.
FANNY
(to GABRIEL)
My sweetheart. Over there.

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

14

SERGEANT DOGGETT
You, sir...
(he has spotted GABRIEL)
...next to the pretty lady!
(FANNY ROBBIN blushes)
There’s a good strong figure of a
man. Always room in the ranks for
gentlemen of your calibre. Come
join us, sir!
A moment of hesitation.
FANNY
Go on. You’d make a fine soldier.
But GABRIEL shakes his head and shrinks back into the crowd,
walking away as DOGGETT continues.
SERGEANT DOGGETT
Or that gentleman there, you look
like a patriot. Come on lad, don’t
be shy, step forward...
GABRIEL takes one more look over his shoulder, then heads on
his way.
But FANNY has followed him FANNY
You might try Weatherbury!
(GABRIEL turns)
If you’re looking for work, try
Weatherbury. There’s a farm there
needs all the help it can get.
GABRIEL
Thank you. I’ll do that.
(a moment. He notices her
carpet-bag, her thin
clothes)
You should have a cloak, cold night
like this.
FANNY
(with forced pride)
Oh, no, Francis’ll take care of me.
He’s a sergeant. We’re going to be
married soon you see.
GABRIEL
But tonight, you have lodgings?
FANNY
No. Not tonight. Not yet.
GABRIEL reaches into his pocket and offers her a coin.

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

15

FANNY (CONT’D)
I am taken care of.
(Pride vs. Necessity.
GABRIEL persists.)
But if you’re sure can spare it...
(and she takes it)
I’ll repay you. I’ll send it to
Weatherbury. But please, don’t tell
anyone there you saw me. I’ve run
away you see. Let it be our secret.
GABRIEL nods assent and she hurries off, carrying all her
possessions.
30

EXT. CASTERBRIDGE LANE - DUSK
GABRIEL walks on towards Weatherbury now. Exhausted, it’s
time to rest.

31

31

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
A feeble camp fire. Scooping leaves into a pile, GABRIEL
makes a mattress of sorts in the woods. Exhausted from the
day’s humiliations, he pulls his blanket up and tries to
sleep.

The NOISES of the wood at night. And then a new noise. SHOUTS
of alarm.
GABRIEL sits. Through the trees, a red glow like the end of a
cigar...
32

32

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
Half a mile away a fire is clearly visible, blazing out of
control. Human shouts, the panic of cattle and horses.

From the edge of the woods, GABRIEL watches impassively. None
of his business. Nothing to do with him.
Then a decision. He heads off towards the flames.
33

EXT. RICK YARD, EVERDENE FARM - NIGHT
A hayrick in flames, burning with startling speed and
intensity.

A rag-tag group of farmhands - JOSEPH, JACOB, BILLY, LABAN,
CAINY and JAN - all hurl water uselessly onto the flames.
GABRIEL arrives.
GABRIEL
Who’s in charge here?
LABAN TALL
Who are you?
GABRIEL
Who’s in charge? Where’s your
farmer?
JOSEPH POORGRASS
Look - the barn!
Sure enough, the fire has spread to the roof of the barn,
where all the crop is kept.
GABRIEL
This rick is lost. It’s the barn
you need to save. D’you understand?
They stare uselessly at the stranger.
GABRIEL (CONT’D)
Ladder?
JOSEPH POORGRASS
It was on the rick.
GABRIEL thinks for a moment. He takes the scarf from JOSEPH’s
neck and wraps it around his face, making a make-shift mask.
Then he grabs a bucket of water, pours it over his head, and
strides towards the barn.
34

EXT. RICK YARD, EVERDENE FARM - NIGHT

34

A haywain has ignited, burning furiously down one side, the
side nearest the barn.
GABRIEL
Get it away! Now!
And he leads the men in pulling the flaming cart away from
the precious barn.
But it’s too late! The barn roof is starting to burn.
They do so, but the cart itself is in flames now. GABRIEL
steadies himself and looks across to the barn roof.

INT. BARN, RICK YARD, EVERDENE FARM - NIGHT

GABRIEL runs inside, through smoke and the crop, searching
for a way to the roof. The whole building is a tinderbox, but
he clambers to the highest level despite the flames above
him.
36

EXT. BARN, RICK YARD, EVERDENE FARM - NIGHT

36

And now he appears on the roof (through a hatch? via a
ladder? TO BE DISCUSSED) and begins smothering the burning
thatch as the MEN watch from below.
37

EXT. RICK YARD, EVERDENE FARM

- DAWN

37

The fire is extinguished. Thick smoke hangs in the air, a
battlefield after the fighting. GABRIEL, blackened and
exhausted, is washing the soot from his face. He gathers his
possessions, ready to move on, when a maid approaches. This
is LIDDY LIDDY (O.S.)
The farmer’s here.
GABRIEL
About time too. Where’s he been?
LIDDY
She’d like to thank you.
GABRIEL stops still. Stands straight.
A FIGURE approaches, her face covered against the smoke. A
WOMAN. She slows. Stops. She uncovers her face BATHSHEBA
No. It can’t be.
GABRIEL smiles. And BATHSHEBA EVERDENE, owner of Weatherbury
Farm smiles back at him.
BATHSHEBA (CONT’D)
Mr Oak, is that really you?
GABRIEL
Do you happen to want a shepherd,
ma’am?
BATHSHEBA
As a matter of fact, I do.
38

EXT. RICK YARD, EVERDENE FARM - DAY

38

As the WORKERS clear away the fire damage, BATHSHEBA and OAK
walk.

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

BATHSHEBA
I owe you an immense debt, Mr Oak.
If I’d lost the barn, I’d have lost
my farm.
GABRIEL
Your farm?
BATHSHEBA
It’s my inheritance And they turn a corner, REVEALING the main house, a little
run-down perhaps, but still fine and imposing.
BATHSHEBA (CONT’D)
I loved it here as a little girl.
When my uncle passed away, he left
it to me. Of course it’s a little
ragged now but this was once the
finest farm for miles. I intend to
make it so again.
(she glances at Gabriel)
Perhaps you find the idea
preposterous too, Mr Oak?
GABRIEL
I no longer have that luxury.
BATHSHEBA
I’m truly sorry to hear of your
great loss, Mr Oak, but if this
reversal of fortunes causes you any
embarrassment...
(GABRIEL is silent))
I think it best if you address me
as ‘ma’am’ or ‘Miss Everdene’. In
turn I will address you as Mr Oak.
GABRIEL
I understand. Ma’am.
An awkward smile, and she goes.

INT. GREAT HALL, EVERDENE FARM - DAY

BATHSHEBA sits at a great oak table, a cash box in front of
her.
A noise from the doorway - LIDDY, BATHSHEBA’s maid, friend
and confidante.

Fiercely protective of her mistress and, despite being the
daughter of BILLY SMALLBURY, fiercely proud of her status.

BATHSHEBA
Send them in.

A little later. Paid or waiting to be paid are JAN COGGAN - strong, capable, reliable, a companionable
bachelor.
LABAN TALL. Handsome, conceited, suspicious of GABRIEL’s easy
charm.
JOSEPH POORGRASS is weak, physically inept, painfully shy,
especially around BATHSHEBA.
JACOB SMALLBURY, LIDDY’s grandfather, is the self-appointed
elder statesman, given to wise pronouncements, alcohol and
laziness.
BILLY SMALLBURY, his son, is reliable, slightly put-upon by
both father and daughter.
CAINY BALL is an awkward teenager, easily distracted, always
in the way.
TEDDY COGGAN, JAN’s young brother, is the youngest, indulged
and spoiled by the others.
TEMPERANCE and SOBERNESS MILLER are the opposite of what
their names suggest; flirtatious, irreverent, ‘yielding’.
MRS COGGAN is the housekeeper and cook, JAN’s mother,
perpetually harassed and dusted in flour.
SUSAN TALL is the ferocious, controlling wife of Laban,
perpetually enraged at his boozing, his lack of social
advancement.
MARYANN MONEY is LIDDY’s side-kick, good-humoured, a dreamer,
easily perplexed.

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

BATHSHEBA hands out the money to each in turn, LIDDY proudly
by her side. Next up is BATHSHEBA
Joseph Poorgrass! Which one is
Joseph Poorgrass?
JOSPEH POORGRASS steps forward. LIDDY indicates ‘hat off’.
BATHSHEBA (CONT’D)
And what do you do, Joseph
Poorgrass?
JOSEPH POORGRASS
I does general things and in Spring
I shoot the rooks and help at pigkilling, Sir, I mean Ma’am.
BATHSHEBA
Here’s seven and ninepence, and
another ten shillings as I’m new.
JOSEPH POORGRASS
Thank you, Ma’am.
BATHSHEBA
Now. Fanny Robbin? Where is she?
JACOB SMALLBURY
She has run away ma’am. With a
soldier.
GABRIEL picks up on this PENNYWAYS
Not a soldier, a sergeant!
Sceptical laughter. BATHSHEBA is unamused.
BATHSHEBA
Bailiff Pennyways, here is ten
shillings and a further ten. This
ends our association. You are
dismissed.
PENNYWAYS
Beg pardon, ma’am?
BATHSHEBA
When my uncle was alive, this was a
fine, productive farm. Since his
death it has fallen into ruin PENNYWAYS leans into BATHSHEBA, his face full of menace.
GABRIEL stands, at the ready.
PENNYWAYS
Now see here, Miss -

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

21

BATHSHEBA
- a fire threatens to destroy the
barn and you’re nowhere to be
found. I have no use for men like
you, Mr Pennyways. You are
dismissed.
She holds her nerve. PENNYWAYS’s bluff is called. A moment as
he scans the room for support that will not come. Addressing
the others PENNYWAYS
I’d get out while you can if I was
you!
And he leaves. If BATHSHEBA is shaken, she hides it well.
Settling herself.
BATHSHEBA
Now. You’ve met Mr Oak, our new
shepherd. You understand your
duties, Mr Oak?
GABRIEL
If I don’t, I’ll ask you. Ma’am.
BATHSHEBA
(she stands to address the
room)
From now on you have a mistress,
not a master. I don’t yet know my
talents in farming, but I shall do
my best. If you suppose, because
I’m a woman, that I don’t know bad
from good, right from wrong, then
leave. But to those who choose to
stay, I promise you this. I shall
be up before you are awake, I shall
be in the fields before you are up.
It is my intention to astonish you
all. Now - back to work, please.
She stands and leaves the room. The WORKERS look on, some
impressed, some sceptical, some duly astonished.
40

EXT. MELCHESTER MOOR - DUSK

40

As the evening falls, FANNY walks through the mud of a
riverside path in barely adequate shoes towards MELCHESTER
BARRACKS. She still carries her carpet-bag, still on the
move.
It’s a barren, bleak landscape, and some of the hope, some of
the certainty has gone from FANNY’s adventure.

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

41

22

EXT. MELCHESTER BARRACKS - DUSK

41

A river. A wall, high and blank, with shuttered windows.
FANNY counts the windows FANNY
One, two, three, four...
She picks up a handful of earth, throws it. The small window
opens, and TROY appears.
TROY
Who’s there?
FANNY
Is it Sergeant Frank Troy?
TROY
Who is it?
FANNY
Frank, don’t you know me? Fanny
Robbin!
TROY
Fanny!
FANNY
Yes!
TROY
How did you get here?
FANNY
You said I was to come.
TROY
Well...I said that you might.
You’re too late!
FANNY
You can’t come out and see me?
TROY
No no, the barrack gates are closed
and I have no leave. I’ll find you
tomorrow.
FANNY
Tomorrow! Oh, Frank. Then I won’t
see you till then?
TROY
Do you have a place to stay?
FANNY
Yes. No. I’ll find somewhere. When
will it be?

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

23

TROY
What?
FANNY
What you promised...Don’t make me
say it. You say it first!
TROY
You say it.
FANNY
When will we get married?
TROY
Soon FANNY
Have you asked permission?
TROY
If I said I’ll marry you, I will.
FANNY
Oh, I love you Francis Troy!
TROY
Shhhh! Tomorrow.
He closes the window but FANNY lingers, full of hope.
42

EXT. CORN EXCHANGE, CASTERBRIDGE - DAY

42

Market Day. The building is at the very heart of the town,
imposing, high-domed and noisy, a sort of stock-exchange for
grain.
Outside, BATHSHEBA and LIDDY hoist hefty bags of grain
samples from her carriage and heads towards the entrance.
43

INT. CORN EXCHANGE, CASTERBRIDGE - DAY

43

Inside, it’s a temple of commerce, and a strictly male
preserve that echoes with bargaining, banter and deal-making - until BATHSHEBA enters, LIDDY behind her.
BATHSHEBA
(a whisper)
We have a perfect right to be here.
All heads turn. They could not be more surprised if a small
elephant had entered the hall. A silence. Then the murmur of
gossip, disapproval, some admiration.
Meanwhile, one WELL-DRESSED GENTLEMAN clears his throat.

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

24

BOLDWOOD
Gentlemen, shall we return to
business?
This man is BOLDWOOD, forties, self-contained, handsome in a
Roman way; dignified, the nearest Casterbridge has to
aristocracy, and clearly a step above the tradesmen around
him.
Needless to say, BATHSHEBA notices him But indifferent, BOLDWOOD returns to business.
44

INT. CORN EXCHANGE, CASTERBRIDGE - DAY

44

A little later. Still BATHSHEBA stands alone, looking for her
first customer as the MALE CROWD mills around her. LIDDY
returns;
LIDDY
Perhaps we should go, Miss.
But a FARMER catches her eye. There’s nothing for it BATHSHEBA
It’s Farmer Stone, isn’t it? I’m
Farmer Everdene’s niece. He talked
about you with such admiration.
A moment. And the FARMER approaches 45

INT. CORN EXCHANGE, CASTERBRIDGE - DAY

45

And now BATHSHEBA is surrounded by FARMERS. She is enjoying
herself now, as she pours the grain sample into FARMER
STONE’s hand.
FARMER STONE
How much?
BATHSHEBA
Five pounds a quarter.
FARMER STONE
Three pounds ten shillings.
BATHSHEBA
You paid my uncle five pounds. It’s
the same grain, Mr Stone.
FARMER STONE
Three pounds ten.
And now BOLDWOOD has approached.

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

25

BATHSHEBA
How about you, sir? You’ll pay me
five pounds?
He tips his hat and walks away. BATHSHEBA watches him.
FARMER STONE
Very well. Four pounds BATHSHEBA
- and ten shillings.
FARMER STONE
Four pounds five.
BATHSHEBA
Perhaps I should move on...
FARMER STONE
Very well. Four and ten.
A handshake, the audience enjoying the show, almost as much
as BATHSHEBA is enjoying the success.
Her eyes seek out BOLDWOOD, but he is already on to more
important matters.
MUSIC UP: The wheezing of a church organ, the sound of the
choir.
46

INT. CHURCH, WEATHERBURY - DAY

46

BATHSHEBA and LIDDY are in their Sunday best, taking their
seats in the congregation.
BATHSHEBA
It was as bad as being married.
Eyes everywhere!
LIDDY
Men! They do like to stare at us.
BATHSHEBA
There was only one man who had the
good sense to pay no attention to
me 47

INT. CHURCH, WEATHERBURY - DAY

47

A hymn. BOLDWOOD sings in a strong dignified baritone. But
despite BATHSHEBA’s glances, he remains maddeningly
indifferent.
Elsewhere, GABRIEL sits in the gallery with the MALE WORKERS,
attracting admiring glances from the WOMEN opposite. He
observes BATHSHEBA, observing BOLDWOOD.

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

26

LIDDY
Rich, handsome, it sends the local
girls mad. The Taylor sisters
worked at him for two years. Jane
Perkins spent twenty pounds in new
clothes and might as well have
thrown it out the window. It’s said
when he was young his sweetheart
jilted him...
BATHSHEBA
People always say that. Women don’t
jilt men. Men jilt us.
LIDDY
Did someone jilt you, miss?
And there’s GABRIEL, talking with the other MEN.
BATHSHEBA
Me? Certainly not. A man did ask to
marry me once, some time ago.
LIDDY
And you wouldn’t have him?
BATHSHEBA
I thought he wasn’t good enough for
me.
LIDDY
What a luxury, to have a choice.
‘Kiss my foot sir, my face is for
mouths of consequence’.
BATHSHEBA
It wasn’t like that at all.
LIDDY
Why? Did you love him?
BATHSHEBA doesn’t answer.
48

EXT. FIELDS, EVERDENE FARM - DAY

48

Early February morning, and BATHSHEBA is the first in the
fields as promised, a shotgun slung across her back, a pair
of pheasants hanging by her side.
BATHSHEBA watches and waits, and is about to fire when She hears a noise behind her, and turns. MR BOLDWOOD is there
on horseback. He rides on.
BATHSHEBA
Mr Boldwood!

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

27

BOLDWOOD
Don’t shoot me, please.
BATHSHEBA
I had no intention of shooting you.
(nothing)
It’s Miss Everdene! Your neighbour.
Farmer Everdene’s niece? I’m
managing the farm alone now,
perhaps you’d heard.
BOLDWOOD
Yes, I’m sure you’ll do very well.
In the circumstances.
(BATHSHEBA bridles)
Well. As you say, we are
neighbours. Good hunting, Miss
Everdene.
And that’s it. BATHSHEBA watches him go.
49

INT. STUDY, EVERDENE FARM - DAY

49

Surrounded by books, papers, dusty boxes, BATHSHEBA and LIDDY
are sorting through Farmer Everdene’s old belongings.
LIDDY
Listen to this. ‘The Rose is red,
The Violet blue, Carnations
sweet...’
BATHSHEBA
What are you doing, Liddy?
LIDDY
It’s a valentine. I was going to
send it to Joseph Poorgrass, just
to see the look of panic on his
face.
A gawdy, sentimental confection of paper and lace.
BATHSHEBA
Poor boy. A little far-fetched,
isn’t it?
LIDDY
Either him or Mr Oak BATHSHEBA
(abruptly)
No. Certainly not Mr Oak.
LIDDY
I know! Let’s send it to high and
mighty Mr Boldwood! Ignoring you
like that..

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

28

BATHSHEBA
Yes!
LIDDY
Or perhaps not.
BATHSHEBA
No, we must!
LIDDY
We mustn’t!
BATHSHEBA
Why not?
LIDDY
Because he won’t see the humour BATHSHEBA
I’m sure he will. Or perhaps he
won’t, perhaps it is too much.
LIDDY
Perhaps it is.
(But it’s too much fun to
miss)
Unless we toss for it.
From the debris, she finds a book.
BATHSHEBA
Open Boldwood, closed LIDDY
Joseph Poorgrass.
BATHSHEBA
Closed - Joseph, open - Boldwood.
LIDDY
Are we ready?
BATHSHEBA
Quickly, before I change my mind!
And she tosses the book high into the air. It lands. Open.

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

29

INT. DINING ROOM, BOLDWOOD’S MANSION - DAY

50

THE VALENTINE. It lies in its envelope on the large dining
table in Boldwood’s large, comfortable house.
BOLDWOOD raises his tea to his lips, and glances casually at
the envelope. He turns it over.
Facing him is the wax seal. Imprinted in the red wax the
words ‘Marry Me’
Carefully, he places the tea-cup down. He checks the address yes, no mistake there.
With forensic care, he takes a knife and carefully prises
open the envelope so as not to break the seal, then pulls out
the card; the gaudy confection of lace and cupids. An
entirely foreign object, he holds it with his finger tips.
He opens it, and a perfectly ordered world is knocked out of
shape.
51

INT. ALL SAINT’S CHURCH, CASTERBRIDGE - DAY

51

A service is just ending and as the PARISHIONERS disperse,
TROY walks towards the PRIEST, splendid in full uniform,
nerves concealed behind his swagger.
TROY
Sergeant Troy, for half-past
eleven.
PRIEST
Yes, Sergeant Troy and TROY
Miss Fanny Robbin. We’re getting
married.
52

INT. ALL SAINT’S CHURCH, CASTERBRIDGE - DAY

52

Later. TROY, stands erect at the altar, impassive. The sound
of a door behind him. He doesn’t turn, but smiles in
anticipation of the sight of his bride...
But it’s only SERGEANT DOGGETT, his best man.
DOGGETT
Sorry I’m late, old boy. Not long
now.
A few PARISHIONERS have remained to spectate.

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

30

PARISHIONER ONE
(whispers)
Where is she?
TROY doesn’t move.
53

EXT. STREET/CHURCH, CASTERBRIDGE - DAY

53

And sure enough, here comes FANNY ROBBIN hurrying along. She
looks beautiful, a simple bunch of flowers grasped in her
hand.
54

INT. ALL SAINT’S CHURCH, CASTERBRIDGE - DAY

54

The PRIEST has now taken a seat. TROY’s composure remains
intact.
55

EXT. STREET/CHURCH, CASTERBRIDGE - DAY

55

ALL SOUL’s CHURCH is up ahead. FANNY pauses for a moment,
takes a deep breath, composes herself, suppresses her joy.
And enters.
A GROOM stands at the altar. A BRIDE too. Consternation as
the small CONGREGATION turn and see FANNY in her wedding
dress.
Confusion.
56

INT. ALL SAINT’S CHURCH, CASTERBRIDGE - DAY

56

Meanwhile TROY still waits. Discomfort now. The OLD LADIES
whispering. There is some laughter, but TROY’s features
remain fixed.
The church bells start to chime. DOGGETT places his hand on
TROY’s shoulder.
DOGGETT
Don’t think she’s coming, old boy.
A moment. Then with a snap of his heels TROY turns and
marches back down the aisle with as much dignity as he can
muster.
As he passes, the OLD LADIES smile sympathetically. ‘Poor
lamb!’ Enraging! Humiliating.
57

EXT. ALL SAINT’S CHURCH, CASTERBRIDGE - DAY

57

FANNY hurtles across the square just in time to see a stern
TROY marching away from the church.

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

31

FANNY
Frank! Oh, Frank! Wait!
TROY doesn’t break stride as FANNY tries to make light of it.
FANNY (CONT’D)
There’s been a mistake! I thought
you told me All Soul’s not All
Saint’s! I went to the wrong
church! I thought you’d jilted me,
Frank!
(No smile)
I don’t blame you, but I’m sure you
did say...or perhaps it was my
mistake after all. Still, we’re
here now! Smile, Frank, please?
(He doesn’t speak.)
Tomorrow then! We’ll get married
tomorrow, just the same?
And TROY stops and turns on her. With barely concealed rageTROY
Do you think I’ll be humiliated a
second time?
FANNY
It was a mistake, Frank.
TROY
(striding on)
It was.
FANNY
You will marry me though, won’t
you, Frank? You promised, and you
know I love you. Don’t walk away. I
have nowhere else to go. Tell me, I
beg you, when? When?
People are watching now, she’s struggling to maintain her
pride despite growing panic. She takes TROY’s arm, he shakes
her off.
There’s a final look from TROY before he turns and walks
away, leaving FANNY, heartbroken, standing in the street in
her wedding dress.
58

INT. DINING ROOM, BOLDWOOD’S MANSION - DAY

58

‘Marry Me’. The words in red wax on the envelope, which now
sits on BOLDWOOD’s mantelpiece. BOLDWOOD takes his
breakfast, as before, but now his eye returns to the
envelope.
The BUTLER arrives, bearing the post. BOLDWOOD sorts through
it eagerly, stops -

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

32

He crosses to the window. In the Everdene fields beyond,
GABRIEL.
59

EXT. FIELDS, EVERDENE FARM - DAY

59

GABRIEL is stacking logs with the help of little TEDDY
COGGAN. BOLDWOOD strides purposefully across fields towards
him.
BOLDWOOD
Mr Oak!
A little LATER. BOLDWOOD now helping GABRIEL with his work.
BOLDWOOD (CONT’D)
A letter came to me by mistake.
‘The new shepherd, Weatherbury’ I
can only assume it’s for you.
GABRIEL opens the letter. The COIN, returned from Fanny as
promised. A simple note. ‘Thank You For Your Kindness’
BOLDWOOD, meanwhile, produces his pocket book, containing the
letter. With forced casualness BOLDWOOD (CONT’D)
On a separate matter, between
ourselves, I wonder, do you know
whose handwriting this is?
(He shows him the
envelope)
It’s just a foolish thing GABRIEL
There was no name?
BOLDWOOD
No, I believe that is where the fun
lies. Do you recognise it?
He does. And with recognition, he understands BATHSHEBA’s
intentions too. Her perceived ambition. It all makes terrible
sense.
GABRIEL
Miss Everdene’s.
60

INT. CORN EXCHANGE, CASTERBRIDGE - DAY
Deaf to the noise around him, BOLDWOOD watches BATHSHEBA.
For the first time he notices the curve of her neck, the
colour of her lips, the shape of her ear. To FARMER STONE;

60

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

33

BOLDWOOD
Is Miss Everdene considered
attractive?
FARMER STONE
(has he gone mad?)
Very much indeed.
FARMERS surround her, as she smiles, banters, negotiates with
a HANDSOME YOUNG MAN, all watched from BOLDWOOD’s P.O.V.
Another new experience - jealousy.
Suddenly she looks across, and catches his eye. Hurriedly he
looks away.
This is all new. For the first time in his life, his heart
has begun to move within him.
60A

INT. BOLDWOOD’S MANSION - NIGHT

60A

And so he sits. Insomniac. All peace of mind lost.
61

EXT. YARD - DAY

61

End of May and the time comes for sheep-washing. To this end,
a series of fences have been set up, obliging the sheep to
enter a deep stonework pool.
Up to their chests in chill water, stand GABRIEL and his
assistant shepherd JAN. They must hold the panicked sheep
under water then hoist them on to dry land.
BATHSHEBA and LIDDY arrive.
LIDDY
Careful you don’t get wet, Mr Oak!
GABRIEL
Perhaps you’d care to lend a hand?
The MEN laugh.
BATHSHEBA
You don’t think I could? Very well.
And BATHSHEBA strides towards the water and, without
hesitation, steps right in.
She is able and strong, smiling at the applause of the
laughter of the others then getting on with the work.
For one moment, in the muddy water, we see the shapes of
BATHSHEBA and GABRIEL’s hands meeting for a moment.

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

62

34

EXT. YARD - DAY

62

BOLDWOOD, in his Sunday best, hears the shouts and splashes
of the sheep-dipping, and approaches. Then stops.
The most extraordinary sight. BATHSHEBA up to her waist in
the water, manoeuvring the sheep through the water.
LIDDY approaches him quickly and he speaks to her for a
moment, passing on a message.
LIDDY
Mister Boldwood wondered if he
might have a word.
BATHSHEBA
Mr Boldwood, of course, perhaps
later? I’ll need to BOLDWOOD nods and leaves. BATHSHEBA hauls herself out of the
water. The MEN exchange meaningful glances.
GABRIEL
Back to work.
They do so. But GABRIEL can’t help but watch BATHSHEBA.
63

EXT/INT. TERRACE/GREAT HALL, BOLDWOOD’S MANSION - DAY

63

The house is beautiful. BATHSHEBA and BOLDWOOD stand on the
terrace, somewhat self-conscious.
BOLDWOOD
One-thousand acres, a mix of arable
and livestock. An orchard. A
glasshouse. I have some interesting
pigs.
(BATHSHEBA laughs.
BOLDWOOD too)
Some other time perhaps.
BATHSHEBA and BOLDWOOD walk through the fine hall, BOLDWOOD
watching her, noting how she fits in here. This seems right.
BATHSHEBA
You have a very beautiful house.
(no reply from BOLDWOOD)
Mr Boldwood?
BOLDWOOD
Forgive me, perhaps I should...I’ll
speak plainly. I have felt lately,
more and more, that my present way
of living is bad, in every respect
bad. But we all change, and my
change in this matter came with
seeing you.

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

And BATHSHEBA knows what must come next.
BOLDWOOD (CONT’D)
Miss Everdene, I want, very much,
more than anything, to have you as
my wife.
(grasping her hand - )
Miss Everdene - marry me!
BATHSHEBA
I feel, Mr Boldwood, though I
respect you very much, I do not
feel - what would justify me to in accepting your offer.
BOLDWOOD looks as if he has been struck.
BOLDWOOD
I see. I have known disappointments
in the past, and I wouldn’t have
asked in this instance if I hadn’t
been led to believe (he fumbles in his pocket,
the ENVELOPE)
Unless...unless I’m mistaken BATHSHEBA
The valentine. No, you’re not
mistaken, but I should never have
sent it. Forgive me, it was
thoughtless to disturb your peace
of mind BOLDWOOD
‘Thoughtless’?
BATHSHEBA
Impetuous, frivolous So

BOLDWOOD
- you meant it as a joke?

BATHSHEBA
No! Not a joke, not exactly BOLDWOOD
Then a premonition perhaps? Of
future feelings?
BATHSHEBA
I haven’t fallen in love with you.
Certainly I may say that. I like
and respect you very much but
you’re too...dignified for me.

35

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

36

BOLDWOOD
Too dignified? I see. Perhaps you
think I’m too old, but I’ll take
more care of you than anyone your
own age BATHSHEBA
- I’m sure you would BOLDWOOD
I’ll protect you, and care for you,
you shall have no worries, your
farm shall be looked after by a
man, you shall never have to so
much as look out of doors at
harvest time.
(BATHSHEBA shakes her
head)
You shall have dresses, a gig, a
piano (- and smiles, despite
herself)
I amuse you?
BATHSHEBA
No, it’s only...I have my own
piano, and my own farm and I have
no need for a husband.
(BOLDWOOD doesn’t know
what to say)
I think I’d like to return home. My
hat, please...
BOLDWOOD
Yes, yes of course. I’ll...I’ll get
someone to drive you. Your hat.
But he’s in something of a daze, knocked sideways by this
disappointment. BATHSHEBA sees this, and takes pity.
BATHSHEBA
Mr Boldwood. I have made you
miserable. It was very wicked of me
And in her apology he sees his chance.
BOLDWOOD
Will you reconsider?
She takes him in. Handsome, dignified. Would it be so bad?
BOLDWOOD (CONT’D)
Can I hope for a change of heart?
BATHSHEBA
Don’t hope. Let me think.

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

37

BOLDWOOD
Yes. Yes, I’ll give you time.
(He smiles, gives her the
hat)
I will wait.
64

INT. WORKSHOP, EVERDENE FARM - DUSK

64

GABRIEL works alone by lamplight, sharpening blades on a
pedal-driven grindstone in anticipation of the impending
shearing. Sparks illuminate GABRIEL’s face.
BATHSHEBA
You’re working late, Mr Oak.
GABRIEL
We’ll need sharp blades for the
shearing.
His manner is subdued. There’s something on his mind. So BATHSHEBA
Will you teach me?
GABRIEL gives up his seat at the grindstone. BATHSHEBA sits
down, and GABRIEL sets the wheel in motion.
GABRIEL
Here (he sits behind, arms
wrapped around her)
Incline the edge so. That’s right.
Like that.
His hands cover hers. The wheel spins. Too casually BATHSHEBA
I wanted to ask, did the men say
anything today, about Mr Boldwood?
GABRIEL
Yes they did.
BATHSHEBA
What did they say?
GABRIEL
That you’d be married before the
end of the year.
BATHSHEBA
I see. Well I’d like you to
contradict it, to the men.
And any warmth there might have been instantly disappears.
The wheel spins, then GABRIEL speaks -

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

GABRIEL
Well, Bathsheba BATHSHEBA
‘Miss Everdene’ please GABRIEL
- if Mr Boldwood did really speak
of marriage then I’m not going to
tell stories just to please you.
BATHSHEBA
I said that I wanted you just to
mention that it was not true that I
was going to marry him.
GABRIEL
I can say that if you wish. I could
also give an opinion of what you’ve
done.
BATHSHEBA
I dare say, but I do not want your
opinion, Mr Oak!
GABRIEL
I suppose not.
A beat.
BATHSHEBA
Well, what is your opinion?
GABRIEL
That you are greatly to blame for
playing pranks on a man like Mr
Boldwood. Your actions were
unworthy of you.
BATHSHEBA
Unworthy! May I ask where my
unworthiness lies? In rejecting you
perhaps?
GABRIEL
I’ve long given up thinking of
that.
BATHSHEBA
Or wishing it?
GABRIEL
Or wishing it either.
(Does he mean it? Has he
moved on? This blow hits
too. With great dignity)
But I will say this;
(MORE)

38

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

39

GABRIEL (CONT'D)
Leading on a man you don’t care for
is beneath you.
And with this parting shot he turns and walks away.
BATHSHEBA
I cannot allow an employee to
criticise my private conduct. You
will please leave the farm at the
end of the week!
GABRIEL
(calmly)
I’d prefer to go at once.
BATHSHEBA
Then go! I never want to see your
face again!
A long moment.
GABRIEL
Very well ‘Miss Everdene’. I’ll go
first thing tomorrow.
He walks away with great dignity, and BATHSHEBA can only
watch him go.
65

EXT. GABRIEL’S COTTAGE - DAY

65

His possessions on his back, GABRIEL closes the door of his
small, comfortable cottage, and sets off once again.
66

EXT. FIELDS, EVERDENE FARM - DAY

66

Bathsheba gallops up, Jan and Joseph running alongside.
Scattered across the field the sheep lie on their side, their
stomachs swollen, Jacob and Billy examining them.
BATHSHEBA
What is wrong with them?
JOSEPH POORGRASS
They broke fence and got into a
field of young clover. Makes their
stomachs swell. Come see.
They approach one particular sheep, breathing fast, foam at
its mouth.
BATHSHEBA
How did this happen? Who let them
break fence?
(the men look at the
ground)

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

BATHSHEBA (CONT'D)
And why didn’t you tell me sooner?
(BATHSHEBA kneels.)
Poor thing. What do we do now?
JOSEPH POORGRASS
Nothing. The whole flock is
blasted.
BATHSHEBA
Blasted? You mean they’re all going
to die?
BILLY SMALLBURY
Most probably.
JAN COGGAN
(with a sheep)
Another one gone here.
BATHSHEBA
But there must be something we can
do!
JACOB SMALLBURY
(the elder, sagely)
Only one way of saving them.
BATHSHEBA
What is it? Tell me, quickly!
JACOB SMALLBURY
They must be pierced in their side
with a tool made on purpose. A
hollow pipe, with a pricker inside.
BATHSHEBA
Well can you do it?
Eventually JACOB SMALLBURY
No.
BATHSHEBA
Can I?
JACOB SMALLBURY
Good lord, no. One inch to the
right or left and you kill the ewe
for sure. Not even a shepherd can
do it as a rule.

BATHSHEBA
Then who? Tell me!
(They look at the floor-)
No. Oh no.

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

67

GABRIEL is well on his way to Casterbridge with his
possessions on his back. Healthier than when we first saw
him, but on the road again.
A shout comes across the fields.
JOSEPH POORGRASS
Gabriel! Gabriel Oak! Wait!
He turns, curious.
68

EXT. FIELDS, EVERDENE FARM - DAY
BATHSHEBA stooped over another dying sheep. Elsewhere JAN COGGAN
Lost another one, ma’am
Breathless, JOSEPH POORGRASS rides up.
BATHSHEBA
Why are you alone? Did you find
him?
JOSEPH POORGRASS
Yes miss...
BATHSHEBA
So what did he say?
JOSEPH POORGRASS
(embarrassed)
He said...
BATHSHEBA
Joseph, please...
All are listening.
JOSEPH POORGRASS
He said you’re to come in person
and request him civilly in a proper
manner.

68

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

42

BATHSHEBA
Where does he get his airs! I’ll do
no such thing!
JOSEPH POORGRASS
He said you’d say that. He said to
reply that ‘Beggars can’t be
choosers’.
69

EXT. COUNTRY LANE - DAY

69

GABRIEL waits patiently, a picture of nonchalance as a figure
on horseback appears. BATHSHEBA.
If he’s enjoying this, he tries not to let it show. The mere
ghost of a smile as he stands.
BATHSHEBA dismounts. With some effort, she re-arranges her
face, from vexed pride to forced humility.
BATHSHEBA
Mr Oak. Gabriel?
(a deep breath)
Please don’t desert me, Gabriel. I
need your help.
A moment. Then he walks abruptly towards BATHSHEBA...
...and past her, taking the reins of the horse, mounting it.
He’s about to ride off.
BATHSHEBA (CONT’D)
Make room for me.
GABRIEL smiles and holds out his hand to her GABRIEL
Hold on.
He urges the horse into a gallop, BATHSHEBA holding on tight
around his waist.

- then across the fields. LIDDY, JAN COGGAN and the others
see them approach. JAN smiles.
JAN COGGAN
You sly old dog...
71

EXT. FIELDS, EVERDENE FARM - DAY

71

GABRIEL kneels over a bloated sheep, reaches into his pocket
and produces a strange instrument.

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

43

A brass rod, with a needle concealed inside, a kind of basic
syringe. Like a surgeon, he passes his hand over the sheep’s
flank.
GABRIEL
Find the spot...just here, between
the ribs...
And with a sudden, skilled motion, he stabs the sheep.
BATHSHEBA and the others recoil.
LIDDY
Oh Lord!
GABRIEL
Looks worse than it is. NowThe lance pierces the skin, and when the needle is removed
the air rushes audibly through the tube. Slowly the sheep
visibly deflates, a living balloon. BATHSHEBA can’t help but
laugh. GABRIEL smiles and sets to work on his next patient.
72

EXT. FIELDS, EVERDENE FARM - DAY

72

BATHSHEBA has the syringe now, and leans poised over a
bloated sheep. The other WORKERS look on BATHSHEBA
Here?
GABRIEL
Fast and strong and she won’t feel
it.
He takes her fingers, places them on a spot over the sheep’s
ribs. BATHSHEBA summons up her courage, raises the syringe
like a dagger LIDDY
I CAN’T LOOK!
BATHSHEBA
Liddy!
(she raises it again)
Perhaps you should do it.
GABRIEL
And when I’m not here?
BATHSHEBA stabs the sheep. The needle is removed, the sheep
deflates. The crowd sighs in relief. BATHSHEBA laughs...

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

44

EXT. FIELDS, EVERDENE FARM - DUSK

73

And now the sun is setting, and BATHSHEBA watches, admiring
his skill and dedication as GABRIEL, lit by lamps, moves
expertly from one sheep to the next.
BATHSHEBA
Ridiculous animals. Always getting
into trouble.
And if GABRIEL remains his own misfortune, he doesn’t say
anything.
The last of the sheep is on its feet again. He crosses to
BATHSHEBA, and they survey the scene.
BATHSHEBA (CONT’D)
Gabriel. Stay on with me?
He smiles. And nothing more needs to be said.
74

EXT. EVERDENE GARDEN - NIGHT

74

A celebratory meal. BATHSHEBA’s piano has been moved out into
the yard and decorated with flowers, and JAN COGGAN plays and
sings a tune.
GABRIEL is dressed smartly, a man on the move at one end of
the table, BATHSHEBA at the other.
As twilight falls and the music plays, BATHSHEBA surveys the
bucolic scene and allows herself a smile for her
achievements. Her eyes meet GABRIEL’s in gratitude.
JOSEPH POORGRASS, meanwhile, has conquered his nerves enough
to sing a song, a truly awful dirge, literally MONOTONOUS.
JOSEPH POORGRASS
I sowed the seeds of love/It was
all in the spring....
It’s all too much for LIDDY, who has the tablecloth stuffed
into her mouth to suppress laughter.
JOSEPH POORGRASS (CONT’D)
O the willow tree will twist...
The fit of giggles is spreading along the table. BATHSHEBA
struggles with a straight face. Then she sees a new arrival;
MR BOLDWOOD.
BATHSHEBA
(premature applause)
Thank you Joseph! That’s enough.
(JOSEPH sits)
Mr Boldwood! Will you join us?
Where (MORE)

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

45

BATHSHEBA (CONT'D)
(a place for him to sit)
Gabriel, would you mind...
A brief moment of awkwardness as the social order reestablishes itself. But LIDDY/MARYANN/TEMPERANCE AND SOBERNESS
There’s a space next to me,
Gabriel!/Over here, Mr Oak!/Come
and sit with us, Mr Oak!
He joins LIDDY further down the table.
JACOB SMALLBURY
A song, ma’am?
General approval at the notion.
BATHSHEBA
Me? I couldn’t possibly!
(LIDDY and GABRIEL share
an ironic smile)
I don’t know what to say! Very
well.
She sits at the piano and begins to play. The song is ‘The
Banks of Allan Water’ and, after a moment’s nervousness, she
sings it beautifully.
GABRIEL watches her, then turns to look at BOLDWOOD,
enthroned at the head of the table, the heir apparent.
GABRIEL notes the devotion in his eyes. To everyone’s
surprise, he starts to sing too. A faltering baritone that
grows in confidence.
The song becomes a duet then ends with LOUD APPLAUSE. GABRIEL
realises that this is a battle that he can never hope to win.
He joins in the applause.
75

EXT. EVERDENE GARDEN - NIGHT

75

In the exquisite evening, a lantern between them, BATHSHEBA
and BOLDWOOD walk away from the party.
BOLDWOOD
I thought we were rather good.
BATHSHEBA
So did I!
(They laugh. A beat.)
I wanted to thank you for not
approaching me again on...that
subject.
BOLDWOOD
It has not been easy.

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

46

BATHSHEBA
And I’m grateful for your
restraint, Mr Boldwood. I can’t
give you my answer tonight but by
the end of the summer, in six weeks
time, my mind will be clearer and
you’ll have my decision then.
BOLDWOOD
It’s enough. It’s more than I hoped
for.
BATHSHEBA
Was there...anything else?
A moment. Will he kiss her? Her face is raised towards him,
exquisite in the glow of the lamp.
She smiles - granting permission. But BOLDWOOD
Do you wish me to accompany you
back to the house?
With disappointment, BATHSHEBA registers the hesitation.
BATHSHEBA
No, I like to walk around the farm
myself each night, to make sure all
is safe.
BOLDWOOD
Then I’ll walk with you BATHSHEBA
I’ve done it many times alone.
Goodnight, Mr Boldwood.
And she walks off, leaving BOLDWOOD hopeful, BATHSHEBA
thoughtful.

EXT. PLANTATION - NIGHT

76

A narrow, overgrown footpath through a fir plantation. The
passage is barely wide enough for one and she’s disconcerted
to see another figure enter the corridor ahead of her.
A MAN.
A moment of fear and hesitation. She gathers her nerves,
lowers the lantern and proceeds to walk. The male figure gets
closer. A scarlet jacket, unbuttoned, an uncertain step.
They are about to pass. Head down, she squeezes by and - is immediately stopped in her tracks. Her dress has become
entangled with the spurs SOLDIER
Have I hurt you?
BATHSHEBA
No SOLDIER
We are entangled. Let me He turns on the lantern. She places the lantern on the
ground, sending great shadows dancing in the trees.
He takes it from her, and raises it so that their faces are
illuminated. SERGEANT FRANK TROY.
The sudden sight of all that silver and scarlet is like the
blare of a trumpet. BATHSHEBA is taken aback. TROY too.
TROY
Good God!
They kneel together simultaneously, then with the lantern
shining onto their faces, they untangle the knot.
BATHSHEBA
We’ve got hitched together somehow.
TROY
Then it seems you’re my prisoner BATHSHEBA
You’re making it worse on purpose -

48

TROY
Now why would I do that?
BATHSHEBA
Let me do it myselfTROY
Why such a hurry? Husband waiting?
(BATHSHEBA is silent)
I have a knife here.
BATHSHEBA
No! Here, let me try(He can’t look away.)
Please don’t stare.
TROY
I can’t help myself.
BATHSHEBA
You’re drunk. I smell it on your
breath.
TROY
I don’t think I’ve ever seen a
woman as beautiful as you.
BATHSHEBA
How dare you!
TROY
Take it or leave it, it’s the
truth.
The knot comes undone suddenly, causing her to stumble
backwards. He pulls her to her feet.
A moment as they face each other, then she bustles off. To
her back TROY (CONT’D)
At least tell me your name! Where
do you live? I want see you again!
And he watches her as she disappears into the night.

EXT. FIELDS, EVERDENE FARM - DAY

77

A bright SUMMER’s day and the FARM WORKERS are making hay.
The MEN lead, scythes flashing in the sun. The WOMEN, wearing
tilt bonnets to protect them from the sun, follow on behind,
raking the cut hay into windrows - ranked piles left to dry
in the sun before binding into sheaths.

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

49

LIDDY and BATHSHEBA join in the work.
LIDDY
Miss, look Amongst the dull yellow smocks, a bright white shirt; TROY,
with a scythe, energetically mowing ahead.
BATHSHEBA
Who is he, Liddy?
LIDDY
Sergeant Francis Troy. Mother was a
French governess, father was a
doctor. Or an Earl, depending on
what you believe. Noble blood, full
of promise, very sharp and trim.
Well educated, good things expected
of him, and he threw it all in to
be a soldier. And a walking ruin to
decent girls.
(BATHSHEBA gives her a
look.)
So they say.
BATHSHEBA
(tuts, strides off)
Well I won’t have it.
LIDDY
What are you doing, Miss?
BATHSHEBA
I’m going to tell him to leave!
And she strides towards TROY. LIDDY watches, amused.
78

EXT. FIELDS, EVERDENE FARM - CONTINUOUS
TROY watches her approach. The other workers too, stop and
stare, GABRIEL amongst them.
BATHSHEBA
Sergeant Troy, I must absolutely
insist that you leave this very
moment!
TROY
I can’t, I have to work off my sin.
He goes back to work.
BATHSHEBA
Well...I wish you wouldn’t.
TROY
Why not?

78

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

50

BATHSHEBA
Because I’d rather not thank you.
TROY
And I’d rather not leave. So I
won’t.
And he returns to work. BATHSHEBA left staring at his back.
GABRIEL lays down his scythe and is about to intervene.
BATHSHEBA
(To TROY, sternly-)
Will you follow me, please?
And she strides off through the tall grass. TROY puts down
his scythe, and follows, grinning.
TROY
Farmer Everdene, you’re quite the
local legend.
BATHSHEBA
Please!
TROY
What angers you exactly? What I
said, or the way I said it?
BATHSHEBA
Neither...both! I won’t allow
strangers to be impudent, even in
praise.
TROY
Even if it’s the truth? You must
know. There must be some man who
tells you that you’re beautiful.
BATHSHEBA
Not to my face, not exactly TROY
But there must be someone, who
kisses you and tells you BATHSHEBA
I’ve never been kissed.
(The admission surprises
both of them. They stop.)
Why couldn’t you have just passed
by and said nothing?
TROY
Half the pleasure of a feeling lies
in being able to express it. Do you
forgive me.

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

51

BATHSHEBA
I do not!
TROY
Why?
BATHSHEBA
Because...the things you say.
TROY
I said you were beautiful and I’ll
say it again. The most beautiful
face I ever saw.
BATHSHEBA
That’s simply not true TROY
But you’ve never seen yourself
through a man’s eyes BATHSHEBA
Of course not TROY
- you don’t know what it’s like.
BATHSHEBA
What is it like?
TROY
Like not being able to think, or
hear, or look in any direction.
Except one.
BATHSHEBA glances to where the WORKERS and GABRIEL, are
staring.
BATHSHEBA
I hope you fight as well as you
speak.
TROY
Better. Meet me tomorrow, eight
o’clock and I’ll show you.
A pause.
BATHSHEBA
I can’t.
TROY
You don’t want to?
BATHSHEBA
Yes, but -

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

52

TROY
Then you must.
BATHSHEBA
I mustn’t. I can’t tell you why,
but I mustn’t...
TROY
But you could. Nobody would know.
BATHSHEBA
Then I must bring Liddy...
TROY
Now why would you want to do that?
BATHSHEBA
Please. Go now.
TROY
Tomorrow night. Eight o’clock. The
hollow in the ferns.
He turns and walks casually away, leaving BATHSHEBA flushed
and breathless.

BATHSHEBA attempts to read. But her mind is elsewhere.
Exasperated, she puts down the book. Glances at the clock.
Picks up the book. Should she go? And 80

If she goes, is she dressed right? She assesses herself in

material against her body. She looks exquisite.

82

An uncultivated tract of land forms a natural amphitheatre,
at the base of which stands a smudge of scarlet.
TROY, waiting.
BATHSHEBA watches him a moment, breathless. She should leave,
immediately.
But he sees her, and smiles.

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

83

EXT. THE HOLLOW IN THE FERNS - EVENING

53

83

An exquisite evening, sultry and sensual. TROY is giving his
lesson, a fearsome looking sword glinting in his hand.
The sword exercise is a series of lethal looking slashes and
thrusts, very precise. TROY narrates as he demonstrates.
TROY
Four right and left cuts, four
right and left thrusts.
(The sword hisses through
the air. BATHSHEBA
watches, entranced.)
Cut one is as sowing corn, two as
if hedging. Three as if reaping,
four as if threshing...Do you trust
me?
BATHSHEBA
I do.
TROY
(He removes his jacket.)
Now. You are my enemy, with this
exception; I shall miss you every
time by a hair’s breadth...
(His hand on her waist, he
positions her as if for a
dance.)
I give you my word as a soldier, I
will not harm you. The sword is
blunt, but you must not flinch.
BATHSHEBA
I’ll try not to.
TROY
(He readies himself)
Very well. Let’s begin.
And suddenly the air is filled with the swash of the blade,
glinting in the sun’s low rays as TROY repeats the exercise,
the blade passing thrillingly close to BATHSHEBA’s body.
And then the display is over. TROY is sweating and BATHSHEBA
too is exhilarated.
BATHSHEBA
Is it over?
TROY
Yes. Except And he raises the point of the sword once more to her cheek.
A flick of the wrist, and a lock of hair falls.

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

54

BATHSHEBA
How did you...how could you cut my
hair?
TROY
This sword could skin you alive.
BATHSHEBA
You lied! You told me I was safe!
TROY
And you were, entirely safe. I gave
you my word.
(He steps closer.)
Now, I will take this - the lock of dark hair lies on her breast. Instinctively
BATHSHEBA turns her face up towards him, and he takes her
face in his hands.
Her first kiss has a startling passion, like nothing she has
ever experienced before. His hand, too, is between her legs.
She gasps.
And then, with a coolness that’s almost callous, he simply
walks away, leaving BATHSHEBA breathless.
84

And as night falls, she walks slowly home, transformed. The
night is warm, it has a sensuality to it. Something has
changed.

BATHSHEBA dresses for her rendezvous. There is no hesitation

BATHSHEBA and GABRIEL walk side by side in silence in the
warmth of the summer evening. But BATHSHEBA is on edge, keen
to get away.
BATHSHEBA
I’m quite happy to walk by myself.
GABRIEL
I’ll walk with you.
They walk a little further.
BATHSHEBA
Still, perhaps I’ll say goodnight GABRIEL
You should have nothing to do with
him. He’s not good enough for you.
BATHSHEBA
Why ever not? He’s perfectly
honourable, perfectly decentGABRIEL
That’s not what I believe.
BATHSHEBA
Why, what have you heard? Tell me!
(And he could. He knows.
But he hesitates.)
You see, it’s all rumours,
prejudice, simply because he’s a
soldier GABRIEL
I like soldiers, but not this one.
I believe him to have no conscience
at all. Stay clear. Don’t listen to
him, don’t believe him. Get rid of
him.
BATHSHEBA
And why should you care?
A moment. They both know.
GABRIEL
I’m not such a fool as to imagine I
might stand a chance now that you
are so...above me. But (A deep breath; this is
hard.)
Mr Boldwood loves you. You would be
safe in his hands.

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

56

BATHSHEBA
You want me to be ‘safe’?
A beat. It pains him to say it, but GABRIEL
Yes, I do.
A long moment. BATHSHEBA is touched, but also surprised by
her own reaction. She reaches for indignation instead.
BATHSHEBA
Then I think it might be best for
both of us if you leave this farm
immediately.
But GABRIEL starts to laugh.
GABRIEL
This is the second time you’ve
pretended to dismiss me BATHSHEBA
Pretended! GABRIEL
What’s the use of it? Sometimes I’d
be glad as a bird to leave this
place, for don’t suppose I’m
content to stay a nobody all my
life. One day I will leave you, you
can be sure of that. But for now I
care for you too much to see you go
to ruin. So if you don’t mind, I’ll
stay by your side.
BATHSHEBA smiles, GABRIEL too. But now another a figure
approaches.
TROY. He stops and waits a little way off.
One moment’s hesitation, and she walks towards TROY.
Without looking back, GABRIEL walks away.

Through the crowds, he sees her; BATHSHEBA, breathless with
anticipation. She watches for a moment and approaches.
They stand in the street, tantalisingly close.
BATHSHEBA
I wasn’t sure if you’d be here.
Frank...
TROY
Of course.
Beneath her cloak, she reaches out one hand. Just their
fingertips entwine.

INT. DINING ROOM, BOLDWOOD’S MANSION - DAY

BOLDWOOD sits alone at a large dining table, taking his
solitary breakfast, reading his mail just as he had on

sound. He notices that his hand is shaking. Carefully, he
puts his tea-cup down.
BOLDWOOD opens the letter.

The coach from Bath makes its lonely way towards Weatherbury.
BOLDWOOD watches the coach approach, his hand tightening on
the silver-headed cane.
The coach stops at the top of the lane that leads to the
Everdene farm. A figure descends;
TROY starts to walk towards the farm.
BOLDWOOD falls into step behind, cane in hand.

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

95

EXT. COUNTRY LANE, EVERDENE FARM - NIGHT
On the approach to BATHSHEBA’s house now.
BOLDWOOD
Going to see her I suppose?
TROY walks on without turning.
BOLDWOOD (CONT’D)
Did you hear me?
TROY
Should I know you?
BOLDWOOD
My name is William Boldwood.
TROY
Never heard of you.
BOLDWOOD
Nevertheless, I wish to have a
conversation. I don’t wish to enter
into questions of right or wrong,
you wouldn’t understand. I’m a
businessman, and I intend a
business transaction with you.
TROY
Go on.
BOLDWOOD
I was engaged to be married to Miss
Everdene until you came along.
TROY
Not quite engaged...
BOLDWOOD
You have heard of me then.
TROY
She told me some foolish old man
was in love with her. You, I
presume.
BOLDWOOD
(he lets this go)
Miss Everdene will never marry you.
You’re not even an officer. She’s
playing with you, you’re too poor,
too low-down. A nobody.
(TROY laughs this off -)
TROY
What is your proposal?

58

95

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

59

BOLDWOOD
Marry the other girl. Leave Miss
Everdene alone. I’ll make it worth
your while.
But this is like a slap for TROY. He considers Boldwood,
taking him seriously now.
TROY
How?
BOLDWOOD
Leave tonight and I’ll give you
fifty pounds. The girl shall have
money too, and after the wedding
I’ll settle a certain amount of
money on the both of you, paid
annually. You can resign your
commission, leave this place, start
a new life. And leave us be.
TROY considers the deal.
TROY
Fifty pounds you say?
BOLDWOOD
I have the money here.
And he produces the money.
TROY
You seem very confident I’ll
accept.
BOLDWOOD
I know what you’re worth.
TROY lets this pass. He takes the money, weighs it in his
hand, then opens the gate and heads towards BATHSHEBA’s
house. BOLDWOOD follows on, alarmed BOLDWOOD (CONT’D)
Where are you going? You must go
tonight, that’s the agreement TROY
I can’t just leave without saying
goodbye. It’ll break her heart.
I’ll tell her I’m not good enough
then go straight away. How’s that?
BOLDWOOD
No word of me or our arrangement.
And never see her again, you must
swear...

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

TROY
I give my solemn vow as a soldier,
that I will...
(Almost at the door, he
suddenly stops.)
But wait a moment....
BOLDWOOD
What is it?
TROY
There’s a problem.
BOLDWOOD
Tell me!
TROY
We’re already married. You see?
TROY holds his hand up to BOLDWOOD’s face.
A gold band on his finger.
BOLDWOOD is broken.
TROY (CONT’D)
We married first thing this
morning. Lovely service in Bath,
very quiet, the two of us.
Tonight’s our wedding night. So,
you see, it seems I am good enough
for her after all.
BOLDWOOD lunges, but TROY intercepts the blow. BOLDWOOD’s
hand goes to TROY’s throat.
BOLDWOOD
I’ll kill you, d’you hear me! I’ll
break your wretched neck!
But TROY swiftly turns the table, shrugging off BOLDWOOD’s
grip and hurling him to the ground. Three sharp blows to the
face - swift and effective.
TROY
(whispering in his ear)
Best kill yourself, old man. Don’t
you think?
(pushing him to the
ground)
Now - pick up your money and go.
You’re trespassing.

TROY surveys his home for the first time. He fingers a
porcelain figure, a book. He picks out notes on the piano,
pours a glass of wine. His hand is still shaking.
This is all his property now. For all its comforts, suddenly
it seems bourgeois, dowdy, dull. A twinge of doubt. There is,
he realises, the potential for this all to go horribly wrong.
A noise, a voice from above. TROY walks towards the stairs.

They make love for the first time. In contrast to the bravado
and swagger of their past encounters, there’s something
tender, tentative about it.

INT. BEDROOM, EVERDENE FARM - MORNING

98

BATHSHEBA sleeps soundly in the tangled sheets.
Sounds from the yard wake TROY. Wearing breeches and his
scarlet jacket, he sits on the edge of the crumpled bed and
lights a cheroot.
From outside, the sound of hammering 99

GABRIEL, POORGRASS and JAN COGGAN are in the yard, well into
the working day.
TROY
Good morning, comrades!
JAN COGGAN
Morning sir!
(hissed to GABRIEL-)
Answer the man!
TROY
Fine old house. Needs a lick of
paint, don’t you think?
(nothing from the MEN)
You, Sir (- GABRIEL)
What’s your name?
For a while it seems as if he might not answer.
GABRIEL
Oak.

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

TROY
Can’t hear you!
GABRIEL
My name is Gabriel Oak.
INTERCUT. BATHSHEBA hears this.
TROY
(to JAN)
Can you hear him? Mr Oak, please
learn to smile and answer when
you’re spoken to. I’ll be down in
the fields some time this week, but
until then we’re not to be
disturbed.
(meeting GABRIEL’s eye;)
Here, this (he tosses them coins)
- is to drink our health.
JAN stoops eagerly to pick up the coins, but GABRIEL doesn’t
move. A figure has appeared behind TROY. BATHSHEBA, wrapped
in the sheet of the marital bed, momentarily catches
GABRIEL’s eye. Nothing shameful in her decision, but still a
concern for GABRIEL.
TROY (CONT’D)
Who is this Mr Oak?
BATHSHEBA
He’s my right hand.
TROY takes this in...
100

EXT. FIELDS, EVERDENE FARM - DAY

100

The harvest begins, the ricks piled high with the fruits of
the year. Back-breaking work, sweaty, the kind of occasion
BATHSHEBA would once have relished.
But not now.
From a carriage at the edge of the field the newly-married
couple watch the workers, sheltered from the heat and
humidity. TROY is now a Gentleman Farmer, ill-at-ease in new
civilian clothes. BATHSHEBA in her fashionable clothes is an
observer, no longer a participant.
GABRIEL glances over at her, then returns to work.
101

EXT. THE RICK YARD, EVERDENE FARM - DUSK

101

Dusty from the days labours, GABRIEL washes. Then notices - a
great fat toad lumbers across the ground.

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

63

OAK kneels and watches its progress. The toad is looking for
shelter - a sure sign that a storm is coming.
He looks to the skies too. The evening is clear, but dark
clouds are already rolling in. Rooks caw, clouds of starlings
wheel confusedly around the sky. The night has a sinister
aspect. There’s a sense of foreboding.
The year’s harvest stands unprotected in the rick yard.
The sound of MUSIC comes from the barn 102

INT. BARN, EVERDENE FARM - DUSK

102

A band is playing and the barn is full of the WORKERS and
their FAMILIES. Foliage and old chandeliers have been hung
from the rafters, food and drink laid out
Clapping, cheering and stomping as TROY and BATHSHEBA dance,
wonderful together, eyes locked. The dance ends to much
applause, TROY and BATHSHEBA at its centre. TROY kisses her;
cheers, laughter.
TROY
Gentlemen! Silence! Friends, it is
not only the Harvest Home that
we’re celebrating. This is also a
wedding feast. A short while ago I
had the happiness to lead to the
altar this beautiful lady, your
mistress, and only now have we been
able to celebrate our happy news.
So please, charge your glasses and
raise them to - my wonderful wife,
Mrs Bathsheba Troy!
GABRIEL watches the applause, then approaches BATHSHEBA.
GABRIEL
(to BATHSHEBA)
I have to tell you TROY
To me, please, Mr Oak.
GABRIEL
(to both of them)
There’s going to be a storm. We
need to protect the ricks or we’ll
lose the harvest.
TROY
And how do you know there’s going
to be a storm?

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

64

GABRIEL
(hesitates, then -)
Certain signs. The animals.
TROY
(laughing, teasing)
The animals told you?
GABRIEL
I need five, six men for an hour,
no more.
BATHSHEBA
Frank, perhaps we ought toTROY
Nonsense! Tonight’s our
celebration. Oak, you have no
glass in your hand - here.
He pours a glass and offers it to GABRIEL.
GABRIEL
With all due respect, we need ablebodied working men, not drunks and
fools...
TROY
It will not rain tonight. My wife
forbids it! Now, if you’ll excuse
me, Mr Oak. Gentlemen, one more
thing. Even though I’m no longer
Sergeant Troy! I remain a soldier
in this one respect (he beckons one of the MEN
forward. He carries -)
Bottles of the finest French
brandy! A triple-strength dose to
every man here!
(Disquiet from BATHSHEBA,
shouts and cheers from
the men)
And if any of you men show the
white feather, then you can look
elsewhere for a winter’s work!
And to cheers and applause, the bottles are passed round.
BATHSHEBA, meanwhile, looks to GABRIEL, wanting to follow.
TROY (CONT’D)
You wouldn’t leave our wedding
party. Would you?
He kisses her, and she does her best not to worry.

But outside, dark clouds have indeed started to form in the
evening sky. A distant flash of lightning.
The harvest stands vulnerable and exposed. GABRIEL makes a
decision.
104

INT. BARN, EVERDENE FARM - NIGHT

104

TROY is in amongst his MEN, laughing, joking, passing out the
brandy, trying to recreate the camaraderie of the barracks.
The WOMEN have largely gone - only SOBERNESS and TEMPERANCE,
neither sober nor temperate, remain.
116

The band strike up again, and TROY leads the singing of a 116
bawdy song. Excluded, BATHSHEBA and all but a few of the
WOMEN have no other choice but to turn and go.

105

EXT. RICK YARD, EVERDENE FARM - NIGHT

GABRIEL hauls the water-proofed tarpaulins into the yard.
Attaching a rope to one corner, he hurls the other end over
the stacks.
106

INT. BARN, EVERDENE FARM - NIGHT

106

Mad dancing from the MEN, TROY the life and soul. A drinking
song now - something like The Barley Mow 107

EXT. RICK YARD, EVERDENE FARM - NIGHT

107

With great effort, GABRIEL hauls at the rope, dragging the
tarpaulin over the top of the third stack. But the wind
catches it, filling it like the sail of a ship.
The storm is overhead now. No rain yet, just startling blue
skeletons of crackling light. GABRIEL takes a long metal rod
with a chain attached - imagine a giant needle and thread and jams it into the highest point of the rick. This he hopes
will act as a lightning conductor.
But there’s still so much to do.
108

INT. BEDROOM, EVERDENE FARM - NIGHT

108

From her bedroom, BATHSHEBA looks out of the window towards
the rick yard. A flash of lightning. GABRIEL silhouetted
against the sky as he begins the work of roughly thatching
the remaining stacks.
She makes a decision. Hurriedly, excitedly, she removes her
jewellery, her party shoes. The old BATHSHEBA, back again.

EXT. RICK YARD, EVERDENE FARM - NIGHT

GABRIEL works on. BATHSHEBA walks towards him, lamp in hand,
in working clothes now.
BATHSHEBA
What can I do?
GABRIEL
It’s too dangerous.
BATHSHEBA
If it’s too dangerous for me, then
it’s too dangerous for you.
(GABRIEL hesitates)
Just tell me what to do.
A rumble of thunder; not much time.
110

INT. BARN, EVERDENE FARM - NIGHT

110

The MEN are visibly staggering now. JOSEPH POORGRASS, slight
and not used to drinking, is laughing hysterically. Young
CAINY BALL, too young to drink, can barely stand. Meanwhile
LABAN TALL has picked a fight with another man, and a messy
brawl is starting.
TROY, the Master of Revels, watches over them.
111

EXT. RICK YARD, EVERDENE FARM - NIGHT

111

Perched on ladders on top of the rick, BATHSHEBA and GABRIEL
work together, hammering sheaves in to place to shelter the
crop. Thunder rolls, lightning crackling but BATHSHEBA
Still no rain.
GABRIEL
It’ll come.
A flash of lightning, the thunder following immediately.
GABRIEL (CONT’D)
Frightened?
BATHSHEBA
Why, are you?
As if in rebuke there’s a terrible crack. Lightning forks
down from the black sky, and strikes the conductor.
Then the terrible peal of thunder. BATHSHEBA, startled,
stumbles and falls. GABRIEL grabs her arm and holds her. A
moment of relieved laughter -

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

67

And then the RAIN starts. An extraordinary downpour.
BATHSHEBA (CONT’D)
Gabriel, if I were to die - and I
may die soon, and I’d hate you to
think badly of me (GABRIEL goes to protest)
Please, let me explain. I didn’t
intend to marry him. I had every
intention of ending it, just as
you’d advised. But he told me about
another woman, a great beauty that
he’d loved before and so, somewhere
between jealousy and distraction..I
married him. Please understand.
(GABRIEL goes to speak)
No opinions. I only wanted you to
know.
GABRIEL smiles. A moment of extreme closeness between them.
For a moment, they might almost kiss. But to what possible
end?
GABRIEL
Go to bed, I can finish the rest
without you. Let me help you He helps her down the ladder. She holds him back.
BATHSHEBA
Gabriel. Thank you.
A look of immense gratitude and affection. GABRIEL accepts
it, and understands, and returns to work.
112

EXT. YARD, EVERDENE FARM

Early morning. The work is completed and GABRIEL, exhausted,
climbs down from the last rick. But someone is watching. At a
distance, MR BOLDWOOD.
GABRIEL
Sir?
(BOLDWOOD turns, walks
smartly away. GABRIEL
follows)
Mr Boldwood, sir BOLDWOOD
I wanted to ensure your mistress’
crops were safe GABRIEL
Wait a moment, sir -

BOLDWOOD (CONT'D)
Good work, Gabriel, she’s
lucky to have you -

He turns. Haunted, strained, pale, soaked to the skin.

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

68

GABRIEL
You seem unwell. You should go
home.
BOLDWOOD
Yes. Yes, I will.
(he hesitates)
Oak, you know that things have not
gone well with me lately. I was
going to get a little settled in
life, but it was not to be. I
daresay I am something of a...joke
about the parish, but I do want to
make it clear that there was no
jilting on her part. We were never
engaged. No matter what people say,
she promised me nothing. And yet,
Gabriel, I feel the most terrible
grief.
(He turns to GABRIEL. With
an awful false bonhomie )
Still! No woman ever had power over
me for any length of time. Not a
word to her. We understand each
other, yes?
And poor, mad BOLDWOOD walks on.
112A

EXT. YARD, EVERDENE FARM - DAY

112A

A dreary day in AUTUMN. TROY stands alone in shirtsleeves, a
broom handle clutched like a sword. He carries out the sword
exercise, as before, the chickens pecking around him. But
there’s something diminished, pathetic about the man in his
civilian clothes.
This private display is watched by BATHSHEBA, with concern
and sadness as he completes the exercise then, in a mad flash
of rage, hurls the broom handle against the wall.
112B

EXT. BOXING ARENA, MARKET SQUARE, CASTERBRIDGE - DAY

112B

A FIST connects with a man’s head. Blood and sweat. Marketday at the Corn Exchange has bought a BOXING MATCH to the
town, and in a corner of the square a CROWD has gathered to
watch PATTERSON Vs. SULLIVAN.
The fight has brought with it BEGGARS, GYPSIES, DRUNKS,
GAMBLERS, SOLDIERS on furlough. And among them is TROY,
smoking a cheroot, aloof, indifferent.
A blow lands. SULLIVAN crashes to the ground.
TROY scowls and stabs out his cheroot. His money is handed
over to the BOOKIES. And TROY stalks off -

- and becomes aware of a BEGGAR WOMAN following close behind.
TROY
No money, I’m afraid. All gone.
He turns. And freezes. The BEGGAR-WOMAN, hunched, barely able
to stand, clutching a familiar, battered carpet bag.
She’s barely recognisable as FANNY ROBBIN. TROY is stunned.
TROY (CONT’D)
Fanny.
FANNY
Hello, Frank.
TROY
What are you doing here? I thought
you were at your mother’s, I
thought you were safe.
(taking her hands)
You’re so pale. You’re shaking.
FANNY
I walked here. I’m very tired.

TROY sees BATHSHEBA searching for him, getting closer
TROY
My wife mustn’t know And there it is; ‘wife’.

No more than you. Fanny (Searching his pockets-)

money. An unmistakable intimacy, a terrible blow. She
quickens her pace 112G

Back to TROY and FANNY. BATHSHEBA is nearly there - he speaks
quickly, desperately...
TROY
I’ve made a terrible mistake,
Fanny, but I will make amends. I
swear on my life, I’ll find a way
to be with you.
FANNY
You’ve sworn before, Frank.
TROY
But this time, this time...
(FANNY smiles sceptically)
Go to Budmouth, stay at the Union FANNY
The workhouse, Frank? TROY
(quickly)
Tonight, just tonight, one night,
then meet me tomorrow at ten at the
bridge. I will bring you all the
money I have, I’ll find a place for
you. You’ll want for nothing and I
promise you, I will make amends.
(-heading to BATHSHEBA -)
Tomorrow, Fanny, at twelve.
And he backs away. FANNY watches him go.
For a moment, BATHSHEBA and FANNY’s eyes meet...
But TROY is approaching now, eyes black with rage.
BATHSHEBA
Do you know who that woman was?
TROY
Get back in the carriage.
BATHSHEBA
Who is she?
And now he grabs her wrist, pulls her towards the carriage violent, public too.

TROY
How dare you spy on me. Get back in
the carriage (grabs her wrist, pulls
her away)
Back in the carriage, damn you!

A grim, grey building, its iron gates forbidding in the
gloom.
FANNY reaches for the wall to steady herself, stumbles,
falls, lies there in the rain.
A light appears in a window. An alarm bell is rung...
117

INT. BEDROOM, EVERDENE FARM - NIGHT

BATHSHEBA lies on one of the bed, TROY on the other,
shirtless, smoking a cheroot. She watches his back. He stubs
out his cheroot. Unbearable tension.
118

INT. GREAT HALL, EVERDENE FARM - DAY
BATHSHEBA eats breakfast alone. TROY strides in.
TROY
Could you let me have twenty
pounds?
BATHSHEBA
What for?
TROY
I need twenty pounds.

118

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

72

BATHSHEBA
If you continue to gamble, I will
lose the farm.
TROY
It’s not for gambling. Do you have
the money or not?
BATHSHEBA
That money is required for farm
expenses.
She returns to her breakfast. TROY looks dangerous.
TROY
You’ve had your fun. Now don’t do
something you’ll regret.
BATHSHEBA
I already have.
TROY
What do you regret?
BATHSHEBA
That our love is at an end.
TROY
Well, all love ends at marriage.
BATHSHEBA
I wish you wouldn’t talk like that.
TROY
I believe you hate me.
BATHSHEBA
I hate your vices.
TROY
Then give me the twenty pounds and
perhaps we can be friends.
Stung, she holds her nerve BATHSHEBA
The money is required for farm
expenses.
A direct challenge.
Then he stands and walks determinedly towards the study.
BATHSHEBA, enraged, follows.

TROY strides towards the bureau.

BATHSHEBA
It’s for that woman, isn’t it?
Tell me her name!
He begins to rifle through the drawers, a thief now.
TROY
I will notBATHSHEBA
Is she married? TROY
No BATHSHEBA
Is she the one you spoke about, the
other woman? Who is she?
TROY
The woman I love! The woman I
should have married instead of you!
(back to the drawers,
scrabbling for the money)
There, you’ve wormed it out of me,
I hope it makes you happy...
(He finds the money.)
And if you regret our marriage,
then you can be damn sure so do I.
BATHSHEBA
But I don’t! I don’t regret it if
you still love me! I still love
you, Frank...
(Desperate, holding him)
Come to bed, let me try and please
you like I used to. I still love
you, Frank. Say you love me too!
Say it, Frank, and kiss me!
He regards her face with a look of appalling scorn, then
pushes her away from him.
TROY
Bathsheba, please. Don’t be so
sentimental.
He pockets the money and goes.

TROY waits anxiously at the appointed time for his rendezvous

pine, a pauper’s casket, a WORKHOUSE OFFICIAL driving. As a
matter of course, TROY removes his hat out of respect...

The cart continues on its way. In the distance, its
destination - the EVERDENE FARM.
123

EXT. YARD, EVERDENE FARM - DAY
GABRIEL and the WORKHOUSE OFFICIAL are in discussion as
BATHSHEBA approaches.
GABRIEL
Well there must be some mistake.
WORKHOUSE OFFICIAL
No mistake, Mr Oak. This was Miss
Robbin’s last known abode.
GABRIEL
No, you’ll have to take her to the
church.
BATHSHEBA
Bring her inside.
GABRIEL
Perhaps we might let her rest in
the coach-house, ma’am.
BATHSHEBA
We’ll do no such thing. Fanny was
my uncle’s servant and we shall
treat her with respect. Bring her
inside please.
Pale, troubled, BATHSHEBA heads into the house.
GABRIEL climbs the waggon, removes the black cloth, and
startsOn the lid he sees words written in chalk;
‘FANNY ROBBIN AND CHILD’
He glances towards BATHSHEBA, waiting at the doorway.
A moment’s thought. She can’t know. GABRIEL takes his
handkerchief and removes the words ‘AND CHILD’

INT. STUDY, EVERDENE FARM - NIGHT
Surrounded by candles, resting on two benches, the coffin
sits in the solemn room. BATHSHEBA and LIDDY, with some
reverence, place flowers and branches around the plain
pauper’s coffin.
LIDDY
Do you want me any longer ma’am?
BATHSHEBA
No more tonight, Liddy.
LIDDY
I’ll wait up if you like.
BATHSHEBA
No, you go to bed.
(LIDDY stands)
Do you know what she died of,
Liddy?
LIDDY
No, miss. There were rumours
but...no.
BATHSHEBA
I see. Liddy, Fanny had a
sweetheart. Is that right?
LIDDY
(LIDDY hesitates.)
Yes, miss. A soldier. A sergeant.
(An admission from Liddy.
And now she knows)
Please, come sit upstairs with me.
BATHSHEBA shakes her head - she is crying quietly
BATHSHEBA
I seem to cry a great deal these
days. I never used to cry at all.
Good night Liddy.
And somewhat reluctantly, LIDDY goes, leaving BATHSHEBA
alone.

INT. STUDY, EVERDENE FARM - NIGHT

124A

Midnight. BATHSHEBA, pacing up and down.
She removes the boughs and flowers from the coffin lid.
She sees Fanny’s name, and the smudged chalk beneath. Her
worst fears...
She finds the nails that hold the rough lid down. A moment...

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

76

Then she takes the poker from the fireplace, places it
beneath the lid, pushes.
She stumbles back. The coffin lies open in the darkness. Her
hands shaking, she reaches for a candle and walks towards the
coffin.
FANNY looks beautiful in the candle light. In her arms, a
bundle confirms BATHSHEBA’s suspicions. She takes the flowers
with which she was adorning the coffin, and now places them
on her rival’s body...
Suddenly TROY
What?
BATHSHEBA stumbles backwards.
BATHSHEBA
I must go.
TROY
Who is it?
BATHSHEBA
I can’t stay. Let me go, I want
air.
TROY
Stay here!
Numb, dazed, TROY crosses and sees his beloved’s face. In her
arms, the bundle of white linen. He reaches for the linen,
reveals the face. A thunderbolt of shame and remorse.
BATHSHEBA
Is it her?
TROY
It is. A boy. I had a son. My son.
TROY crumples, tears forming in his eyes; shock and grief and
remorse.
TROY (CONT’D)
Forgive me...
And as BATHSHEBA looks on, he bends and kisses the lips of
his dead fiancee. It’s a kiss you might give to a sleeping
child, one of surpassing tenderness. BATHSHEBA is
heartbroken.
BATHSHEBA
Frank. Don’t kiss them, I can’t
bear it. I love you more than she
did!

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

TROY
Bathsheba, this woman is more to me
dead than ever were or are or can
ever be. You are nothing to me now.
Nothing.
Heartbroken, BATHSHEBA staggers out 125

EXT. FARMYARD, EVERDENE FARM - DAWN

125

The coffin is loaded onto a hearse.
TROY steps from the house. His farmer’s clothes have been
discarded in favour of his old uniform; the vivid scarlet
jacket. He carries a small suitcase and the sword. He looks
broken, haunted, a deeply changed man.
He takes one last look at the farmhouse that has felt like a
prison, then closes the door.
Turning, GABRIEL is there. The men stand firm. An
acknowledgement of each other. No affection, but no hostility
either. If anything, there’s a sense of TROY handing
something back.
TROY
Goodbye, Mr Oak.
A salute perhaps? GABRIEL nods.
126

EXT. OAK TREE, EVERDENE FARM - DAWN

Early morning, a light rain falling, the end of a long, dark
night of the soul.
Shivering, wet hair clinging to her face, BATHSHEBA sits
beneath an old oak, overlooking the farm that she inherited
with such hope and spirit just nine months ago. Now all she
feels is weariness, a great melancholy.
She sees a figure striding up the hill towards her, hopping
and sliding through the mud.
LIDDY
There you are! Oh, Miss, whatever
are you thinking? You’ll catch your
death.
BATHSHEBA
Is he at home?
LIDDY
Gone, Miss, with Fanny. The money
too.
(LIDDY embrace BATHSHEBA)
I’ve come to take you home.

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

BATHSHEBA
Liddy, will you promise me
something?
LIDDY
Go on.
BATHSHEBA
Don’t ever marry.
LIDDY
Not much chance of that, between
the ugly ones I won’t have and the
handsome ones who won’t have me.
BATHSHEBA
Well if you do find someone, stand
firm. When trouble comes your way,
and it will, don’t run from it.
Stand your ground, even if you’re
cut to pieces. That’s what I intend
to do.
And they start to walk towards the farm.

EXT. CHURCHYARD, WEATHERBURY

A new slab of white marble. The new grave, with new headstone
now in place. A simple inscription;
Erected by Francis Troy. In loving memory of Fanny Robbin and
Child.
TROY takes all the money he has and pays the STONEMASON.
TROY
There you are. That’s everything.
Alone now, he tends to the rough grave as best he can,
planting it with wild flowers, a little garden for her.

stops. In the distance, the sea shimmers invitingly. TROY
thinks for a moment, then changes direction, and heads
towards the coast.

TROY’s possessions, folded and stacked with military
precision, lie on the beach. The sword glints in the sun.
TROY sits, naked, and contemplates the sea. Then he stands
and runs into the waves.
130

EXT. THE SEA - DAY

130

TROY pounding away from the shore, attempting to wash away
the past in the cold sea water.
Breathless, he stops and turns. The beach is somehow a little
further away than he thought. He must have been caught by the
tide. He starts to pound back towards the shore.

But the shore is no nearer. If anything it’s suddenly further
away.

TWO BOYS run on the beach. One of them comes across the

stoop and examine it more closely.

The scarlet jacket is held aloft, the sword is pulled from
its scabbard. It glints in the evening sun. The sight is
intoxicating for the BOYS.
As the sun sets, they play at soldiers at the water’s edge,
sword slicing through driftwood while out to sea, TROY’s
figure is lost in the waves, his voice unheard...
134

EXT. THE SEA - DAY
From far out to sea, TROY watches the boys playing at
soldiers.
There’s a strange calm in his eyes. And he starts to swim
again, this time away from the shore.

EXT. CORN EXCHANGE, CASTERBRIDGE - DAY

135

BATHSHEBA is at work again in the halls of the Corn Exchange.
But the CUSTOMERS who once flocked to her now pass her by.
She notes the disapproving looks, the gossip.
An abandoned wife, her husband the father of an illegitimate
child. There’s a cloud of scandal, disapproval, which she
accepts with as much dignity as she can.
And now TWO MEN are approaching her, a CONSTABLE and a
SOLICITOR. All eyes on her now CONSTABLE
Mrs Troy?
BATHSHEBA
It’s about my husband, isn’t it?
Tell me.
SOLICITOR
I’m afraid...I’m afraid your
husband has drowned.
BATHSHEBA staggers from the blow.
BATHSHEBA
It’s not true. It can’t be.
And now BOLDWOOD is approaching, arriving just as she
collapses.
BOLDWOOD
What did you say to her, man?
CONSTABLE
Her husband is dead. Drowned at
sea.
No glee from BOLDWOOD, a man of action and decision now. He
scoops her up, carrying her through the crowd.
BOLDWOOD
Some air! Gentlemen, some air
please. Make way!
(BATHSHEBA, recovering
now, stirs)
You’ve had the most terrible shock.
My carriage is outside, I’ll take
you home BATHSHEBA
No, put me down please.
He does so immediately.

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

81

BOLDWOOD
You’re hardly in a condition to
drive yourself BATHSHEBA
Please, Mr Boldwood. I’d like to go
home alone.
And she gathers herself and walks, a little unsteadily,
towards the exit.
136

EXT. EVERDENE FARM - DAY

136

A sombre mood at the farm. A pale of black water. LIDDY holds
up BATHSHEBA’s scarlet dress.
LIDDY
You’ll need something to wear, it’s
only proper. Miss?
BATHSHEBA
No. It’s not necessary.
LIDDY
Why not, ma’am?
BATHSHEBA
Because he’s still alive.
LIDDY
Oh, Miss...
BATHSHEBA
Wouldn’t I know more, and wouldn’t
they have found him, and wouldn’t
death feel...different to this?
LIDDY
It’s only natural to hope. But
still BATHSHEBA hesitates.
BATHSHEBA
Very well.
The dress is immersed in the black water.
And now hangs up to dry, dripping black dye on the ground.

BATHSHEBA, austerely beautiful and pale in the black of her
mourning dress, opens it; his jacket, his sword - all his
possessions, retrieved from the beach.
138

EXT. YARD, EVERDENE FARM - DAY

138

GABRIEL returns from a day in the fields to find MR BOLDWOOD
waiting near the entrance. Bright, cheerful BOLDWOOD
Mr Oak, I wonder if I could have a
word.
139

EXT. YARD, EVERDENE FARM - DAY

139

GABRIEL
It’s a great responsibility, sir.
BOLDWOOD
Nonsense! No reason why a man of
your abilities should not be able
to superintend two farms. And why
shouldn’t there be stronger links
between our establishments? Think
of it; two thousand acres under
your sole charge, a share of my
profits...
GABRIEL
Miss Everdene needs me here.
BOLDWOOD
And her farm would have priority.
He sees BATHSHEBA, holding back, watching. There’s something
gleeful about BOLDWOOD here, as if holding something back.
GABRIEL
I would need Miss Everdene’s
permission.
BOLDWOOD
But of course. I wouldn’t dare to
do anything without her blessing.
(GABRIEL contemplates)
If it helps sway your decision,
there’s an old colleague of yours
here He opens a side door and out bounds OLD GEORGE. GABRIEL can’t help but laugh as the dog bounds
into his arms. BOLDWOOD watches with pleasure.

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

83

BOLDWOOD (CONT’D)
He took some finding, Mr Oak. I
hope you’re pleased.
GABRIEL
I am, sir. Very much.
BOLDWOOD
And you’ll give me your decision
soon. Yes?
BATHSHEBA watches too.
140

INT. EVERDENE FARM - DUSK

140

BATHSHEBA and GABRIEL are sheltering from the rain in the
doorway. OLD GEORGE is there too - a memory of past times.
BATHSHEBA
Farmer Oak, you’re getting on in
the world. I knew you would.
GABRIEL
Only with your approval. You know
where my loyalty lies BATHSHEBA
You’re a man of great talent, it’s
only natural that you should rise.
I’ve no desire to hold you back.
She smiles sadly, and he watches her go. Something has been
lost; her arrogance and vanity, but also her spirit and
exuberance.

EXT. FIELDS, EVERDENE FARM - DAY

But the demands of farming are constant, and as late AUTUMN

big old house 141

INT. CHURCH, WEATHERBURY - DAY

141

A hymn. In the church, much has changed. GABRIEL has joined
MR BOLDWOOD in the private pews. In smart Sunday clothes, he
gathers many admiring glances.
BOLDWOOD, too, has lifted his spirits, singing out loud.

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

BATHSHEBA, pale in her mourning black, keeps her eyes
forward.
142

EXT. FIELDS, EVERDENE FARM - DAY

142

BATHSHEBA is out hunting. Pheasants move in the undergrowth,
and she raises her gun to take aim...
But a noise startles them - they fly off, and she turns and
sees BOLDWOOD approaching on horseback.
An accidental encounter.
BATHSHEBA
Mr Boldwood.
BOLDWOOD
Mrs Troy.
BATHSHEBA
We’ve not spoken since BOLDWOOD
No. We’ve not.
BATHSHEBA
I was heading home, if you’d like
to...but perhaps you’re busy.
BOLDWOOD
No. I’d like that. Very much.
143

INT. GREAT HALL, EVERDENE FARM - DAY
They sit, companionably, taking tea.
BATHSHEBA
You were very kind to me that day.
I hope you’ll forgive me if I’ve
kept a certain distance. I’ve
been..not my old self.
BOLDWOOD
No.
(a delicate matter)
Forgive me, I understand there are
debts.
BATHSHEBA
You’ve heard then BOLDWOOD
Your late husband -

143

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

BATHSHEBA
Perhaps we should change the
subject BOLDWOOD
Perhaps I can help.
BATHSHEBA
Mr Boldwood, that’s a kind offer,
but I would never dream of
borrowing BOLDWOOD
Not money.
(He’s trying to restrain
himself. But no good - )
I’m a middle-aged man willing to
protect you for the rest of your
life. You may run your farm if you
wish, without risk. I’ll pay your
departed husband’s debts and
guarantee its financial stability.
It can be your pastime. Of course,
we’d need to wait, for propriety’s
sake. But when you are ready, I’m
offering you shelter, comfort. A
safe harbour. As my wife.
(a beat)
You must at least admire my
persistence.
She smiles at this.
BATHSHEBA
I do BOLDWOOD
And like me?
BATHSHEBA
Yes BOLDWOOD
And respect me?
BATHSHEBA
Yes, of course BOLDWOOD
Which is it, like or respect?
BATHSHEBA
I..it is difficult for a woman to
define her feelings in language
that is made by men to express
theirs. I know I do not love you.

85

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

BATHSHEBA (CONT'D)
I know that I can never love you
the way a woman ought to love her
husband.
BOLDWOOD
If you worry about a lack of
passion on your part, a lack
of...desire, if you worry about
marrying me merely out of guilt and
pity and compromise, well - I don’t
mind. I love you and, for my own
part, I’m content merely to be
liked.
144

INT. STABLE, EVERDENE FARM - NIGHT

144

BATHSHEBA and GABRIEL, wrapped up against the chill night,
stand shoulder to shoulder.
GABRIEL
When must you give your answer?
BATHSHEBA
By Christmas. It’s a terrible
responsibility, to hold a man’s
happiness in your hands. His sanity
too, perhaps.
GABRIEL
Could you...care for him?
BATHSHEBA
You mean love him? Let’s just
say...love is wanting. But then
love’s a worn-out, miserable thing
for me now, love for him or anyone.
And perhaps a marriage without love
is the price I have to pay.
It’s too much for GABRIEL.
GABRIEL
Why are you asking me? Why not ask
Liddy or the parson -?
BATHSHEBA
I need someone who’s clear-headed,
who’s objective, indifferent...
GABRIEL
Then I’m afraid you ask the wrong
man.
And there it is. An admission. She does not answer
immediately.

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

87

BATHSHEBA
Well...thank you, Mr Oak She stands, smiles sadly. And walks away.
145

EXT. COUNTRY LANE, BUDMOUTH - DAY

145

A TRAVELLER walks along a deserted country road. The overcoat
and uniform he wears - an ordinary merchant navy seaman’ - is
somewhat bedraggled and muddied, and the face is unshaven,
but he’s still recognisable as FRANCIS TROY.
A cart approaches. He waits until it’s near then hails the
DRIVER.
TROY
Can you take me to Weatherbury?
(the DRIVER rides on.
TROY’s most charming
smile -)
It is Christmas.
The DRIVER slows TROY jumps on the rear of the cart.

The steam tractor drags the immense tree towards BOLDWOOD’s
mansion.
148

INT. GREAT HALL, BOLDWOOD’S MANSION - DAY

148

The great tree stands in the process of decoration.
Christmas Eve preparations. A table is laid with meats, wine,
bread, even fruit. In pride of place - a pineapple!
BOLDWOOD presides over it all, glowing with hope and
excitement, a little manic perhaps as he shows GABRIEL
around.
BOLDWOOD
So - what do you think?
(the room)
I’m not in the habit of organising
parties. Perhaps we should make it
an annual event, every Christmas
Eve. I’ve invited the whole
village, do you think they’ll come?
(MORE)

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

BOLDWOOD (CONT'D)
Do you think Miss Everdene will
come?
OAK
I’m sure she will.
Fussing in a mirror, he attempts adjust his tie, while
GABRIEL looks on.
BOLDWOOD
You’ll stay too I hope? I know Miss
Everdene would like you to be here.
GABRIEL
Perhaps. For an hour or so.
BOLDWOOD
Look - my hands are shaking I’m so
nervous. Gabriel, would you? As
well as you can, please.
(GABRIEL takes the tie.
Face to face -)
Is there a knot that’s particularly
in fashion?
GABRIEL
You’re asking the wrong man.
BOLDWOOD
What about women? Does a woman keep
her promise?
GABRIEL
She has promised?
BOLDWOOD
An implied promise.
GABRIEL
Once again, I’m not the best person
to BOLDWOOD
But will she do what’s right?
GABRIEL
If it’s not inconvenient to her.
BOLDWOOD
Oak, you’ve become quite cynical
lately! She never promised me that
first time, therefore she has never
broken her promise.
GABRIEL
She hasn’t promised this time
either.

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

89

BOLDWOOD
But she will tonight, I know she
will. And when she does He produces a small box from his pocket. An engagement ring,
heavy with diamonds. GABRIEL can’t speak.
BOLDWOOD (CONT’D)
I wanted to tell you in advance,
Gabriel, because I believe I know
your secret.
(an awkward stab at
intimacy)
I’ve seen you together, the way you
speak to her and watch her and look
after her. And I know of her
profound...affection for you.
You’ve behaved like a man and as
the successful rival - successful
through your kindness - I wish you
to know that I am profoundly
grateful.
And BOLDWOOD beams tearfully in gratitude for the final
fulfilment of his dream. Then BUTLER
The musicians are here, Sir.
The BUTLER departs. To GABRIEL;
BOLDWOOD
Please - stay. Celebrate with us.

EXT. BOLDWOOD’S MANSION - NIGHT

149

Lit by torches, the exterior of the mansion looks
magnificent. MUSIC can be heard. The party has already
started, and BATHSHEBA, descending from the carriage,
beautiful in a black silk dress, looks up at the house with a
terrible sense of foreboding.
At some point this may well be her new home. It’s a fine
house, yet she can barely bring herself to step inside.
She takes LIDDY’s hand, squeezes it, and they head in.
150

INT. GREAT HALL, BOLDWOOD’S MANSION - NIGHT

150

The Party. There are a great many GUESTS here, largely local
GENTRY and FARMERS but, in the spirit of Christmas, some of
the WORKERS too, all of whom are making the most of the food
and the wine. JOSEPH, JACOB, JAN and BILLY, all in their
Sunday best, all in various stages of inebriation.

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

The band PLAYS. The dancing has just begin - rather formal
and reserved at present. BATHSHEBA’s arrival, though, is
enough to draw the other GUEST’s attention. The beautiful
widow, still a source of fascination.
From his vantage point on the great stairs, BOLDWOOD watches
BATHSHEBA arrives. She smiles back, a little awkwardly.
150A

INT. BEDROOM, EVERDENE FARM - DAY

150A

A shadow in the hallway. TROY, alone, in his old home.
He looks through cupboards and drawers. On a shelf, a glimpse
of red. Through torn brown paper, his cavalry jacket, his
sword. All his possessions, retrieved from the beach.
151

INT. GREAT HALL, BOLDWOOD’S MANSION - NIGHT

151

The PARTY continues, the wine taking effect. Dancing has
started, and BOLDWOOD, still keeping his distance, is urging
people to join in the merriment.
BATHSHEBA, sitting apart, watches him. An effort of
imagination; her future husband, her future home.
GABRIEL, in turn, is the centre of attention. TWO FARMER’s
DAUGHTERS, working away at him. But his eyes are on
BATHSHEBA, and her sadness. She catches his eye, smiles.
GABRIEL
Will you excuse me - and he crosses to her, leaving his ADMIRERS sadly alone.
BATHSHEBA
Mr Oak, you’ve broken their hearts (the ADMIRERS)
Go back and talk to them, poor
things GABRIEL
I’ve come to say goodnight. I don’t
suit this kind of affair.
BATHSHEBA
No, neither do I. I wish I could
leave too.
GABRIEL
Stay a little longer. For his sake.
Both look to BOLDWOOD the buoyant host.

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

91

BATHSHEBA
I’ve been trying to imagine myself
living here. I can’t seem to manage
it.
GABRIEL
You’d suit it very well.
BATHSHEBA
Would I?
A sad smile, a moment between them, interrupted by BOLDWOOD.
GABRIEL
I must go.
BOLDWOOD
Not before you’ve danced, both of
you. I insist.
BATHSHEBA
Mr Oak?
Hesitation, then GABRIEL offers his hand. They take to the
floor, and join the other DANCERS.
The dance is by no means intimate or improper. There’s a
distance between them at all times, and LIDDY, BOLDWOOD, the
GUESTS watch it with pleasure.
But for GABRIEL and BATHSHEBA it is a kind of agony.
BATHSHEBA (CONT’D)
Gabriel. Tell me - what am I going
to do?
GABRIEL thinks about this. He sees BOLDWOOD watching them,
the smile on his face, the ring in his pocket.
He can’t answer. BATHSHEBA looks to him BATHSHEBA (CONT’D)
Gabriel?
GABRIEL
Do what is right.
BATHSHEBA struggles to accept the truth of this, and to hide
her disappointment.
BATHSHEBA
Yes. Yes, of course.
She nods tearfully, breaks away and heads for the door.
BOLDWOOD sees her and follows, GABRIEL watching them go.

leaving?
BATHSHEBA
Yes, I should like to go nowBOLDWOOD
But your promise! You said by
Christmas BATHSHEBA
Yes I did.
BOLDWOOD
My proposal, you accept it?
(she hesitates)
A business contract, between two
friends free of passion or
sentiment. I deserve it.
A deep breath.
BATHSHEBA
I give my promise, yes. I give it
as the payment of a debt.
BOLDWOOD
When enough time has passed, you’ll
marry me? Yes?
(She nods.)
Say the words.
BATHSHEBA
I will marry you.
BOLDWOOD’s face lights up. Wild-eyed joy.

BATHSHEBA hurries out into the night, desperate to get away.
She slows, and STOPS.
On the great lawn, lit by flaming torches, the STRANGEST
SIGHT.
A FIGURE stands in the moonlight, scarlet and silver, a sword
in his hand as he practices the sword drill. It might almost
be a ghost.

154

GABRIEL is pulling on his coat, leaving now. LIDDY rushes up
to him, drunk, flirtatious.
LIDDY
Mr Oak, no more excuses, you’ll
dance with me now.
GABRIEL
Have you seen Mrs Troy?
LIDDY
(disappointed)
I think she may have left.

TROY and BATHSHEBA face to face, TROY a little drunk now,

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

94

BATHSHEBA
I knew it, I knew you were alive, I
felt it.
TROY
And here I am. Some fishermen
pulled me from the sea. Then I
discovered I was dead, and found
that I preferred it, for a while
anyway.
BATHSHEBA
So why have you come back, Frank?
TROY
The strangest thing. I found I
missed you. What’s the matter? You
don’t seem very pleased to see me.
No kiss after all this time?
BATHSHEBA
You said that I was dead to you.
TROY
Did I? Well, then - honesty at all
times. I find myself in need of
money. I gave up my profession for
you, it seems harsh that you should
have a house and farm while I’m
living hand to mouth.
BATHSHEBA
There is no money TROY
Then we’ll sell the farm.
BATHSHEBA stands numb, devastated - finally defeated.
Near the house a few FIGURES can be seen. GUESTS from the
party, SPECTATORS, incredulous at the sight.
TROY (CONT’D)
Come my love, no tears. Come home
with me. We’ll talk like we used
to.
(BATHSHEBA doesn’t move)
Did you hear what I said? Come.
(No reply)
I’M YOUR HUSBAND AND YOU’LL OBEY
ME, DAMNIT!
Furious, he reaches for her hand and grabs it He sees the engagement ring glittering there. A realisation,
the truth dawning.
TROY smiles, and -

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

95

An EXPLOSION. A gunshot. The force of the blast is immense,
sending TROY sprawling across the lawn, the full force of a
shotgun blast directed straight into his chest.
BOLDWOOD stands, gun in hand. BATHSHEBA’s face, her dress,
are sprayed with blood. She starts to shake. OTHER GUESTS
come running BOLDWOOD
I won’t be robbed again. Not again.
He gives the gun to GABRIEL. Then, with calm simplicity, he
approaches BATHSHEBA, takes her hand, kisses it Then BOLDWOOD walks away.
FADE TO BLACK.

GABRIEL pulls open the wardrobe. Dresses in every colour of

the name ‘Bathsheba Boldwood.’

A grey January day, and rain falls on TROY’s funeral. His
friend and comrade-in-arms SERGEANT DOGGETT and a small
scattering of military men represent his former regiment.
BATHSHEBA stands a little way off, dressed in black, in
mourning for the second time.
The inscription on the gravestone now reads Erected by Francis Troy. In loving memory of Fanny Robbin and
Child. Died October 9th.

heavy gold bracelets.
BATHSHEBA (O.S.)
Let me see.
REVEAL BATHSHEBA, in mourning, as she steps forward gingerly,
and takes in the jewellery.
She takes something from her pocket. The engagement ring that
BOLDWOOD gave her.
GABRIEL
If it’s any consolation, his life
will be spared. A crime of passion.
BATHSHEBA
Because of me.
GABRIEL
You did the right thing in the end.
BATHSHEBA puts the engagement ring back in amongst the other
jewels.
GABRIEL pushes the drawer closed.

The choir is practicing in the church nearby as BATHSHEBA
tends her husband’s grave.
She is still in mourning, but some of the colour has returned
to her face now; not quite the firebrand of the last year,
but not so drawn and haunted.
She becomes aware of a figure behind her; GABRIEL.

FFMC Shooting Script Sept 2013

GABRIEL
I’m sorry, I startled you.
BATHSHEBA
I wanted to tend their grave. I’ve
not been here for so long.

Are you going in?
GABRIEL
Rehearsals. I sing bass in the
choir.
BATHSHEBA
Yes, I’ve heard you.
GABRIEL
Then I apologise.
(she smiles)
I’d been hoping for a chance to
talk to you. We’ve not spoken as
much as I’d have liked BATHSHEBA
No GABRIEL
And I wanted an opportunity to
say...well, the fact is I’m leaving
England.
BATHSHEBA
Leaving?
GABRIEL
To go to America. I’ve a mind to
try California, and there’s a boat
leaving Bristol. Four day’s time.
I’ll be on it.
(She’s struggling to take
this all in. )
I understand that I should give you
notice.
BATHSHEBA
No, you must go when you want.
GABRIEL
Then I’ll leave first thing in the
morning. No fuss. I think that’s
best.
And BATHSHEBA stands, shell-shocked in the graveyard as
GABRIEL walks away.
The choir sings. She is struggling to take this all in.

breathless)
You’ll think I’m strange, but...I
thought..I wanted to know..
Gabriel, have I offended you?

No BATHSHEBA
- or upset you in some way?
GABRIEL
Not at all.
BATHSHEBA
Is it money? I will pay you more,
Gabriel, whatever you want.
GABRIEL
I don’t need money now.
BATHSHEBA
A formal partnership then?
GABRIEL
...nor a partnership. The farm
belongs to you alone. The finest
farm for miles around.

Then why are you going?
A moment.

I said I’d leave you one day.

(he smiles)
It’s time for you to fight your own
battles, and win them too. I
believe in you entirely. I don’t
believe there’s anything you can’t
do.
And that’s the end of the discussion.
BATHSHEBA
So we should say goodbye then.
GABRIEL
I suppose so.
BATHSHEBA
Thank you, Gabriel. You’ve believed
in me and fought for me and stood
by my side when all the world was
against me, and we’ve been through
so much together - Wasn’t I your
first sweetheart? Weren’t you mine?
- and now to have to carry on
without you when I’ve loved you for
so long (and there it is)
I love you, Gabriel. There.
A moment GABRIEL
If I knew BATHSHEBA
Go on.
GABRIEL
If I knew that you would let me
love you and marry you BATHSHEBA
- but you’ll never know.
GABRIEL
Why not?
BATHSHEBA
Because you never ask!
GABRIEL
Would you say no again?
BATHSHEBA
I don’t know. Probably.

GABRIEL can’t help himself. He laughs, and she laughs too.
BATHSHEBA (CONT’D)
So why don’t you, Gabriel? Ask me
now. Ask me!
A moment and then he steps towards her, takes her in his arms
and kisses her. And then 167A

INT. CHURCH, WEATHERBURY - DAY

167A

We are in the church, GABRIEL and BATHSHEBA at the altar,
smart but not over-dressed, GABRIEL immensely proud.
GABRIEL
I will.
The VICAR turns to BATHSHEBA VICAR
Wilt thou have this man to thy
wedded husband?
In the small but happy congregation, LIDDY, the MEN, MRS
HURST. But our attention is on BATHSHEBA, C.U., listening
intently.
VICAR (CONT’D)
Wilt thou obey him, and serve him,
love, honour and keep him in
sickness and in health?
This is not just a conventional form of words, but a solemn
vow and she weighs each part. Obey, serve, love, honour...
VICAR (CONT’D)
And forsaking all others, keep thee
only to him, so long as you both
shall live?
A suspended moment. A decision.
And then, finally, with joy and conviction, an affirmation BATHSHEBA
Yes. Yes, I will.
167B

EXT. CHURCH, WEATHERBURY - DAY

167B

The doors of the church - burst open as the CONGREGATION spills out. All the workers
are there - LIDDY laughing and crying at the same time, MRS
HURST too. Not a grand marriage, but a joyous celebration
none the less. A ramshackle procession forms, heading down
the country lane.

And at the rear walk the bride and groom.
BATHSHEBA takes GABRIEL’s arm, and rests her head on her
husband’s shoulder.
FADE OUT.
THE END
