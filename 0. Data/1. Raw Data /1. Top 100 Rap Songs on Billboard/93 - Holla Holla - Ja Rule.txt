All my niggaz thats ready to get (Dollaz Dollaz)

[Verse 1:]
Think you fuckin' wit Ja, Nada
Watcha wanna go Dolla for Dolla??? (Holla Holla)
My niggaz is (Hotta Hotta) 
Fucks plenty bitches, and dug bitches for petty niggaz
You look in me eyes and tell me they style aint ridiculous
(Bitches Bitches) Pop da pussy and bounce like (Hit it Hit it)
Sure if your favorite is long (Get it Get it) Baby Baby 
Dont you wanna leave tonite and fuck with me 
Cause we really need to be freaking off at any cost
Its on me, if you married, then get a divorce
When I hits it, some women get twisted
Have em' twitchin', like "Damn look what the dick did"
I just wanna hit it the worst way, right after a long day
And put the puss on lay-a-way, Heard me?
Im that, Dirty nigga that get you hot, and heat it 
Baby girl if you want it as bad as you need it

[Chorus: Repeat 2x]

[Verse 2:]
Let me holla at my true thugs
If niggas want war, bust slugs
Nigga, what? Im hotta hotta and just cant be touched
Plus, anybody that fucks with me, gonna get felt
How many want it? Determines how the slugs get dealt
Cuz I (Spit em' Spit em') 
Choke them niggas like roaches and then (Clip em' Clip em)
Long as Im alive, Ima (Hit em' Hit em')
Respect mines, to the day of my demise
Dont fuck with me, cuz the flow's (Killa Killa)
Whoever eva who wants it? 
Its yours, now your gonna (Get it Get it) 
(Feela Feela) Nigga full of holes
Treat em' like hoes, and show no love to them homo thugs
Its us you wanna fuck with
As soon as them slugs skip from body to body
Go from grave to bit
I dont respect it, plus niggas commited treason 
Who want it with Ja? Who ready to die breathing?

[Chorus: Repeat 2x]

[Verse 3:]
Ja baby, one of the many, many niggas who sip Henny
With the the two seaters, sittin on twenties
I, I be wit running in, running out
Then, thou bestow hit em' up, gun em' down
Niggaz aint ready for Ja, any way, any how
I give it give it to niggaz, claimin' that they live it
Real (Niggaz Niggaz) brandish the iron and flash
Like (Hold this Hold this) when you got nothing to live for
Notice, niggaz be hot, and more explosive
Focus, ready to rip em' up with the dope, this
My life, niggaz is frontin', and stuntin' for nothing
Better act right, fore' I spark and dim your lights??
Im a hazard, to niggaz, a bastard
To bitches, when in doubt, go for stealth, and clap the finish
Anything movin' rightfully hit for wrong doin'
I'ma follow and enourage all my niggaz to WHAT?!? 

[Chorus: Repeat til' end]
