WEBBIE LYRICS

"Independent"
(feat. Lil Boosie, Lil Phat from 3 Deep)

[Chorus:]
Independent do you know what that mean? [Repeat 2x]
She got to her own house
She got her own car
Two jobs work hard you a bad broad
If you ain't on sit down [Repeat 4x]

[Verse 1: Webbie]
Independent do you know what that mean?
Baby Phat just relaxed
Front your own flat screen
Fat Folks Cook or clean that a maka maka seen
When you're calling her on her cellular she tells you she needs not a god damn thing
You a hot damn thing
If you think you finna get her with a god damn chain
You're insane boy, you better get some god damn chains
He a fool up in the school
Even walked across the stage
And she says I love Webbie
From his looks to his waves
The stilettos the J's depend on how the weather look
Flip flop slippers just to show off the pedicure
Flip flop niggas just depend on how the cheddar look
She'll buy her own I don't think she'll never look
In a man face standing waiting for him to take care of her
She'll rather go to work and pay the bills on schedule

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Lil Phat]
She a dome dime diva
Gotta like Keisha
Work that meter
'cause she a good freaka
'cause she stay on her shit
She got her own shit
She don't never trip 'cause all she want is that dick
She bouncy flossy keep them hoes off me
Gotta little slang man I love when she talking
A independent chick do you know what that mean
She cook she clean never smell like onion rings
22's on her whip
Oh she do it large (she do it large)
When she break a nigga off
Get a nigga spoiled
She a bad Lil chick
A fly little chick
Hit me on my phone she like to ride dick
Got her stunner shades on looking like something
Staying young hair long she a nice something
Like to go to the mall everyday for an outfit
Hair did, nails did, independent what she call it

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Lil Boosie]
She got her own house
Drive her own whip
Range rover all white... like her toe tips
She got a pretty smile smell real good
Only time she need a man for that good drill
They by the bar to
They superstars to
They be like you ain't got no money take you broke tail home
In baby phat they on
They cloths match they phone
They be like YEAH!!! when they song come on
Leave the club kinda early
'cause they gotta go to work
I mess with supervisors who got credit like they perfect
So dusty feet please don't bother me
I got independent dimes on my mind...who spoil me
Gucci hat...Gucci fit so sick
That's a gift from my independent chick that serve
Tryna get me next to her gotta be yourself mayne 'cause she got her own money she don't need no help mayne.

[Chorus]
