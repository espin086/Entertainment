2 CHAINZ LYRICS

"No Lie"
(feat. Drake)

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
I am smoking on that gas, life should be on Cinemax
Movie, Bought my boo bigger tits and a bigger ass
Who he's, not I, I smoke strong, that Popeye
Louie V's in my archives, black diamonds, apartheid
Bread up and my top down
On the block with a block out
Hit ya ass with that block out
Dope enough to go in yo nostrils
I'll take ya girl and kid nap her
Feed her to my mattress
The skeleton in my closet
It's probably dead ass rappers
It's probably pussy ass niggas
Don't try me I pull that trigga
Got ya car note in my cup
And your rent in my swisha
That pussy so good I miss ya
Head game's so vicious
And all I get is cheese
Like I'm taking pictures

[Hook: Drake]
I say fuck you, 'less I'm with' ya
If I take you out of the picture
I know real niggas won't miss ya
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-I-ee-I
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-I-ee-I
Real niggas, say word,
Ye ain't never told no lie
Ye ain't never told no lie
Real niggas, say word,
Ye ain't never told no lie
Ye ain't never told no lie
Real niggas, stay true
Ye ain't never told no lie
Ye ain't never told no lie
That's a thing I don't do
Nah I just do it for the niggas
That are trying to see a million 'fore they die
Wattup

[Verse 2: Drake]
2 Chainz and champagne
You want true, that's true enough
Forbes list like every year
My office is my tour bus
She came through, she brought food
She got fucked, she knew wassup
She think I'm the realest out
And I say "damn, that makes two of us"
Oh that look like what's her name
Chances are there's what's her name
Chances are, if she was acting up
Then I fucked her once and never fucked again
She could have a Grammy, I still treat her ass like a nominee
Just need to know what that pussy like so one time it's fine with me
Young as an intern, with money like I built the shit
Streets talking that confirm
Go ask them who just catch shit
Stay keeping my cup full so I'm extra charged like a state tax
Me an' Chainz go way back
We don't talk shit, we just say facts (Yes Lord)

[Hook: Drake]
I say fuck you, 'less I'm with' ya
If I take you out of the picture
I know real niggas won't miss ya
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-I-ee-I
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-I-ee-I
Real niggas, say word,
Ye ain't never told no lie
Ye ain't never told no lie
Real niggas, say word,
Ye ain't never told no lie
Ye ain't never told no lie
Real niggas, stay true
Ye ain't never told no lie
Ye ain't never told no lie
That's a thing I don't do
Nah I just do it for the niggas
That are trying to see a million 'fore they die
Wattup

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Name a nigga that want some
I'll out rap his ass
I'll trap his ass
Put his ass in a plastic bag with his trashy ass
Take 'em out, bring 'em in
Them whole things, 2Pac without a nose ring
Thug Life, one wife, a mistress and a girlfriend
I did what they say I wouldn't (go)
Went where they say I couldn't (true)
YSL belt buckle
Ya'll niggas sure is looking
Ya'll niggas sure is lucky
2 Chainz on my rugby
Left hand on that steering wheel
Right hand on that pussy

[Hook: Drake]
I say fuck you, 'less I'm with' ya
If I take you out of the picture
I know real niggas won't miss ya
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-I-ee-I
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-I-ee-I
Real niggas, say word,
Ye ain't never told no lie
Ye ain't never told no lie
Real niggas, say word,
Ye ain't never told no lie
Ye ain't never told no lie
Real niggas, stay true
Ye ain't never told no lie
Ye ain't never told no lie
That's a thing I don't do
Nah I just do it for the niggas
That are trying to see a million 'fore they die
