LL COOL J LYRICS

"Loungin"

keep it chickenhead,im lookin for a dime
get my swirve on,make it hot,word is bond, im lickin on your ankle 
bracelet,we'll be sippin' moet wit strawberries and dat shit, im nasty ask me
why i lick my lips so in the darkness i can run my tongue over your tits
its all good sugary,u aint leavin' sit up on my face and help my stash grow 
even
whipped cream taste mean from the back she bounce wit' LL now shorty's on the 
map
i put away the gat,took off the hat,throw ya mo's in the air if u like it like 
that
no doubt boo,i keep it real girl,mad pleasure,blowin up your whole world
whatever's clever i got endless cash,trees from Hawaii, 2 pools or baths

[chorus]
i'll be loungin with LL Cool J
i'll be loungin' with LL,hey hey

uh,my scenario is grand,a dime peice,hennessey up in my hand
i turn out the lights like teddy,im feenin', standin' in the darkness,now im 
ready
uhh,ooh yeah up in ya,let it flow while i pump slow,then i speed it up,heat it 
up
make it mo' tasty,so u can swing low and lace me
use your imagination,u do me,i do u,sex education
its all good, it's cranberry absolut,peach shnapps,feelin' tipsy,loungin' on 
the rooftops
i'm 'bout to spank u on dat ass(ooh) i know u love it when it lasts(true) when 
u need it who u ask (you) what u sayin' when i dash (dont go boo)

[chorus]

u got to bounce wit me suga,word up,u got to bounce wit me suga,worda 
worda,word up...

warm it up suga,make it hot,shorties'll swarm,make me wanna bust shots,we 
speak daily on the regular,run your jibs all day chip in my cellular
shoot down to jamaica,pretty white sand,suntan oil,pina' coladas in my hand
layin up at night,peepin' at stars,remember,when we was at the club in da 
bars?
i told ya my status was that of a don,u thought i was a dog and u aint wanna 
get it on,but my mind has attractin' qualities,all the emotions of a young 
lady
so here u are,smack dab up in the mix,shorty this here's about as good as it 
gets
word up,i'ma treat u like a queen from the heart,crack the bubbly,and let the 
episode start.

[chorus]
